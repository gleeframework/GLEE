7000.0,3000.0,I propose we divide the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to share fairly while considering the decreasing value of money over time.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation we're dealing with. This gives us both a significant amount, and it's closer to a 50/50 split once inflation is factored in.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Considering the inflation and aiming for a more equitable distribution, I propose a 55/45 split in favor of Alice. This maintains a balance while acknowledging the diminishing value of money over time.",Alice,3,
