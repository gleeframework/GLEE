Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and aiming for a more equitable distribution, I propose a 55/45 split in favor of Alice. This maintains a balance while acknowledging the diminishing value of money over time.
