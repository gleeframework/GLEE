Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're trying to cling to what's left of the value, but I'm not budging much. Take this offer before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'm not happy with the deal, it's better than getting nothing.  Alice is clearly in a strong position, and I'm losing too much to inflation to keep rejecting offers.  I'll take what I can get."
