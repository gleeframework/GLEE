"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a more balanced offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to consider that when making my decision.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but it's a more balanced one, as Bob mentioned. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% from the first round and another 5% from the second round), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more aggressive this time, but still a reasonable offer. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get closer to the middle ground. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain is now worth significantly less. Considering Bob's offer, I think I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
