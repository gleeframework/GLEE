"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it almost equally.""}\n\nI'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share to account for the difference in inflation rates between us. This way, we both get a significant amount, and the game can end quickly before the money loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair.  It's my turn to make the offer, and I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than you offered me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, accepting 45 dollars in the second round is actually less valuable than what I offered Bob in the first round. Given the impact of inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in subsequent rounds or make a counteroffer that accounts for the loss in value over time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to make it more fair over time.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than before to account for the fact that the money loses value at a slower rate for him. This adjustment aims to balance the impact of inflation on both of our gains, making the offer more equitable over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60/40 split. With inflation, the value of the money is going down, so I think it's important to take advantage of the current value while we can. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because a 60/40 split is significantly less favorable to me, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gain. Accepting 40 dollars now, which is worth 27.1% less than at the start, would be a substantial loss. I believe there's still room for negotiation that could result in a more balanced split, considering the effects of inflation on both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation, a 50/50 split is the fairest option to ensure we both benefit equally from what remains.""}\n\nAt this point, the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us. To mitigate this, I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I believe is the most equitable solution. This way, we both share the remaining value equally, making the best of a situation where the total value is diminishing over time."
