Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to make it more fair over time. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not convinced this is the best deal for me, even with inflation. Let's see if we can find a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's try a 60/40 split. With inflation, the value of the money is going down, so I think it's important to take advantage of the current value while we can.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the significant impact of inflation, a 50/50 split is the fairest option to ensure we both benefit equally from what remains. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Given the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures that we both get something, and it is the fairest option considering the circumstances."
