Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concern about inflation, but your offer was too skewed in your favor. This offer is my final compromise. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which benefits me. While her offer acknowledges inflation's impact, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. My position strengthens with each round, and I'm willing to bet she'll make a much more appealing offer soon."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, time is running out for both of us.  This is my final offer, let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  Alice's desperation is increasing, and I need to capitalize on that by presenting a firm offer with a clear deadline.  
* **Shifting the Focus:**  By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm shifting the pressure onto her to make a decision. She needs to understand that her options are dwindling rapidly.
* **Balancing Greed and Risk:** While I could push for a more significant share, there's a risk Alice might gamble on a better deal in later rounds. This offer is a calculated risk to secure a favorable outcome now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're reaching a critical point. This offer is a serious compromise on my part, acknowledging the shrinking pot. I urge you to accept and walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to an even split, and the effects of inflation are becoming significant.  While I was aiming for a better share, continuing to push risks a worse outcome. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** While my position strengthens with each round, the value of the potential gains decreases drastically due to inflation.
* **Alice's Desperation:** While Alice is becoming desperate, she's also aware of the dwindling pot. There's a real chance she'll hold out for a slightly better deal for herself, even if it means a smaller overall gain.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable sum, even after inflation. Rejecting it opens the possibility of getting a slightly better deal, but also carries the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to agree. 

This is a compromise, but a pragmatic one that guarantees a decent payout in the face of a shrinking pot and a tough opponent."
