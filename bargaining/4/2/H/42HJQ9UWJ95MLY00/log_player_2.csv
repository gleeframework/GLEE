Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a compromise soon. I'm lowering my ask again, acknowledging the pressure inflation puts on you. Let's close this deal and ensure we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still trying to take advantage of the situation.  While her offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, time is on her side.  If I reject this offer, she will be under more pressure to make a better offer in the next round as we're getting closer to the deadline and she'll risk getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - it accounts for the inflation working against me. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand slightly to put more pressure on Alice.  This offer is aggressive, but the clock is ticking, and she needs to understand the situation's urgency.  By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping she'll see the seriousness and accept a deal that, while slightly favoring me, guarantees she gets something."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm holding firm on this one. You've rejected all my previous offers where I asked for less. This is a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation working against you. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough one, but I need to accept. Alice is clearly not going to budge further, and the inflation is eating into my potential gains with each passing round.  Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
