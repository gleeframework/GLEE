"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. Since the money will be worth less next round, it's in my best interest to grab as much as possible right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm losing 20% of the value of my gain, taking 500,000 is still better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
