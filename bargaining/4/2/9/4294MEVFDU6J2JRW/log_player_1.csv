"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. 50-50 is a good start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think 60-40 is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, my gain is now 40 dollars, which is 80% of the original 50 dollars I proposed. This offer is actually a better deal for me than the original 50-50 split, so I'll accept it.
