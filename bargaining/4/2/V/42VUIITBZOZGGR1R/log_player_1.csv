Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  I think a 55/45 split is more equitable.  It's still a good deal for you, and allows us to move on without further delays. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
