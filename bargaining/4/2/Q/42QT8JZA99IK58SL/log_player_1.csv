I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to see if Bob is willing to accept. I'm hoping he'll value a quick resolution and take the deal, but we'll see!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair. While I understand the inflation factor, I'm not willing to take such a drastic cut. I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm decreasing my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still offering a significant amount to Bob. I hope this is a more reasonable proposal that will lead to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too unfavorable. Even with the inflation, I'm not willing to take such a small share. I'll keep trying to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a slightly lower amount to Bob again to account for the increasing inflation, but I'm still offering a substantial share. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too uneven, even with the inflation factor. I'm going to keep fighting for a better deal, and hopefully, we can reach a compromise before the remaining rounds run out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, hoping to incentivize him to accept. I'm aware of the increasing inflation but I need to maintain a decent share of the money. Hopefully, this will be a more reasonable proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to being more balanced, it's still significantly in his favor. I'm determined to negotiate a fairer split, even with the increasing inflation. I'm not going to give in so easily."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're getting close to the end, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is the fairest option considering the circumstances. I'm hoping Bob will finally see reason and agree to this."
