Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about a 55/45 split, but the inflation hits you harder than me. This offer accounts for that while still giving us a good deal. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400
