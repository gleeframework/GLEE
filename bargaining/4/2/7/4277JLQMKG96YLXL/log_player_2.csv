Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is sticking very close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing.  I need to push for a better split while there's still time."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is a reasonable compromise that gives us both a decent share. Let's close the deal before inflation eats away at the value.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on Bob, let's split the difference again, we're both losing to inflation here 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I have to consider the dwindling value of the money. Alice is clearly aiming for a 60/40 split, and while I'd prefer a more balanced outcome, accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds as inflation keeps eating away at the total."
