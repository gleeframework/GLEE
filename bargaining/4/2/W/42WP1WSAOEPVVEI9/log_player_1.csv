Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split.  Let's move forward! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% reduction in value, but I'm willing to negotiate.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I think I can do better than 45%.
