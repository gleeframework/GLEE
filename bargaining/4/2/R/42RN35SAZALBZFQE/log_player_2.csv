"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I take most of the money since I'm the one making the offer. But you get a decent chunk too. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a very unfair offer, even with the inflation in mind. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept being given only 100,000 out of a million.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
