"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so my gain would be $300,000 * 0.8 = $240,000 and Bob's gain would be $700,000 * 0.8 = $560,000.

I don't think this offer is fair, considering I was initially offered a $600,000 gain and now I'm being offered $240,000. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split in my favor, with me getting $450,000 and Bob getting $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I deserve a better deal. Will you reconsider? 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 48.8% less, so my gain would be $350,000 * 0.516 (1 - 0.488) = $180,528. 

I still think this offer is too skewed in Bob's favor, considering the initial split I proposed. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the inflation and Bob's previous offers. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm not budging further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with me getting $500,000 and Bob getting $500,000."
