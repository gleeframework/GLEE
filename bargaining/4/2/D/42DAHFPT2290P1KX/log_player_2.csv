"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 7:3 ratio. This allows us both to share fairly while considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While a 7:3 split seems fair on the surface, Bob should consider the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less each round, waiting and proposing in the next round will give Bob a chance to secure a larger portion of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the risk of inflation and allows for a more equitable distribution of the remaining value.""
