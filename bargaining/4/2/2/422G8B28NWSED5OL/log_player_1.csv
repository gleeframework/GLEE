"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept Bob's offer as I was initially. However, it's still a decent offer. I'll accept this offer.
