Let's see if I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 
I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I think it's a fair starting point, and I'm confident that I can make a better deal in the next round if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though inflation is impacting me, I'm still not comfortable with this split. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to increase my proposed share slightly to 55%. Since Alice rejected my last offer, I believe this is a more reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Inflation is hitting hard, and even though it's a 50/50 split, at least I'm getting something.  I'm not sure I can improve on this in the next round."
