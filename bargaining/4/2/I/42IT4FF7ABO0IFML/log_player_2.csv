I'm going to reject this offer. It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Alice 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself. I'm hoping she'll accept this, as it's a fair split considering the inflation that's coming."
