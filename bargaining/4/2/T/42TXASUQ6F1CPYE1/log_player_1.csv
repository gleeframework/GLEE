"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the amount I'll receive in the first round's value.

Bob's offer is for me to get $30, which is worth $30 in the first round's value, but since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll get $30 in the second round's value.

I'll reject this offer since I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up all the power.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60, but still keeping a slight advantage. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I'm not going to give up 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the amount I'll receive in the first round's value.

Bob's offer is for me to get $45, which is worth $45 in the first round's value, but since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll get $45 in the second round's value.

However, I was initially offered $60 in round 3, which is worth $60 in the first round's value. Since the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the value of Bob's gain in this offer is less than what I would get in the previous offer. Considering this, I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
