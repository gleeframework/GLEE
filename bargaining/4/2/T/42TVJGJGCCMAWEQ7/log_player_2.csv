"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small portion and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI wouldn't settle for such a small portion, especially considering the impact of inflation on my share in subsequent rounds. I'd rather propose a different division that could potentially offer me a better deal before the value of the money decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground to account for inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI've considered the effects of inflation and decided to propose a division that gives me a larger share. Since the money's value decreases by 10% for me with each round, finding a middle ground early on is beneficial. This proposal gives Alice a significant portion while considering my loss due to inflation."
