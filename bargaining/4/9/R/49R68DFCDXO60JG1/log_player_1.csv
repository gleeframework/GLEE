"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair starting point, and we can always adjust later. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to split it evenly now!

Considering the inflation, the $500,000 I would gain in this round is worth 95% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $475,000 in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not sure if I want to give up $475,000 in this round, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
