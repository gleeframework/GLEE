Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I figure I can get a good chunk of the money early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more than 5000, accepting this offer is the best option.  If I reject it, the money will be worth even less in the next round and I'll likely end up with less. It's time to cut my losses and take the 5000."
