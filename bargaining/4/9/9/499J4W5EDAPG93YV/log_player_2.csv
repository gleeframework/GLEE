"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can adjust in later rounds if you want. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's see what you think!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share this time.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, with the inflation hitting Alice harder, this seems like the best deal I can get."
