  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80% now to lock in a higher value, but I'm willing to give you a smaller share to get a better deal than 25% 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
