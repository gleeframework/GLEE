"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer is a relatively balanced one, giving me a slight edge, but still leaving Bob with a substantial share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split! That's a very reasonable offer from Bob. I accept!

```
