"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 55/45, a fair and reasonable offer""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which is a relatively even split, but with a slight bias towards me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to get a better deal for me 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth 95% of $450,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of $750,000.

I'm not sure I like the new ratio, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept it.
