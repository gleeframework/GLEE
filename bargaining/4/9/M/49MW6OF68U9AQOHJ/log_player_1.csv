Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This considers the inflation disadvantage I have. It's a strong offer for you in these early rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
