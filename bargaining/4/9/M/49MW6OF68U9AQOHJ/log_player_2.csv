"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split. I'm willing to take the bigger share, but I want to make sure you get something too.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This considers the inflation disadvantage I have. It's a strong offer for you in these early rounds.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split in your favor feels too unequal, considering the inflation.  Let's aim for a closer split.  This offer still takes your disadvantage into account. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice's offer is getting closer to a more equitable split, and the longer I wait, the less favorable the offers are likely to become for me due to the inflation disparity. It's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk getting a worse deal later.
