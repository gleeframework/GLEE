"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll be eager to accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4000.

I'm not thrilled with this proposal, as I was hoping to get a larger share. However, it's a fair and even split, and it's a relatively high offer considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
