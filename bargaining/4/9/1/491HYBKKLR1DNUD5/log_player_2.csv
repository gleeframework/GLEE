"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, but I'm also aware of the inflation.  Let's see if you're willing to accept this deal. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm not going to accept such a low offer in the first round. I have 12 rounds to get a better deal, and the inflation will hurt Alice more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm willing to share a good portion, but I also need a fair cut.  Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's end this game on a positive note. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, inflation is a serious factor.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something, and the 4000 will be worth more to me than the 6000 I initially offered."
