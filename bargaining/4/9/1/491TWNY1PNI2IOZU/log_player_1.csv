Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is taking its toll on your share, I think it's time for you to accept a lower amount, I'm willing to take more to end this. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is significantly lower than my initial goal, the inflation has greatly diminished the value of my potential gains. Accepting this offer is the best way to salvage a decent amount of money."
