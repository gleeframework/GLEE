"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! You get 30%, which is a decent amount right now. Consider that the value decreases rapidly for you in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 3000 is something, the value is decreasing rapidly for me in the next round.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair deal. You get a good share, and I get more than I would if we keep going. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear that dragging this out hurts you more than it hurts me.  I'm offering a larger share than you'd get if you refuse and we go another round. Let's be sensible and close this out. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'm still losing value due to inflation, Alice's offer is better than what I'd get if I reject and go another round. It's time to end this game."
