"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think I can do better than your offer, Alice. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Bob is making a counteroffer that gives him a slightly larger share of the money, while still considering the effects of inflation on the value of the money. He is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself while also being mindful of Alice's interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  It's the best you'll get considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Bob is accepting Alice's offer from round 3. Considering the effects of inflation, Bob's gain of $4400 in round 3 is actually equivalent to approximately $4851 in round 1 (4400 / 0.9075), which is more than his gain in Alice's initial offer. Additionally, Alice's gain of $5600 in round 3 is equivalent to approximately $6921 in round 1 (5600 / 0.81), which is less than her gain in her initial offer. Bob is choosing to accept this offer because it provides a relatively better outcome for him, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
