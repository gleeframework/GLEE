Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than your offer, Alice. This way, we both get a fair share considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Let's think about this. Bob's offer is better than his potential gain in the next round if I reject (due to inflation). However, I can likely offer him slightly more than he's willing to accept in the next round and still come out ahead.  It's a risk, but I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob.  It's the best you'll get considering the inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's position:** In round 2, Bob offered a 55/45 split in his favor. The inflation is hurting him more than me, so he's getting desperate for a deal. 
* **My advantage:**  I know he's likely to accept an offer slightly better than what he'd get if he rejects and wins in round 4. 
* **Calculation:**  In round 4, Bob would be looking at a maximum gain of approximately $4975 (5500 - 5%). My offer of $4400 is significantly better than that.
* **Risk:** There's always a risk he'll reject and try to lowball me in round 4, but I'm betting on his desire to secure a deal now."
