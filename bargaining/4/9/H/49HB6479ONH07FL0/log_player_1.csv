"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll evaluate the offer accordingly.

In this case, Bob's offer is actually a 40% gain for me, which is a good deal considering the reduced value of money. I'll accept it.
