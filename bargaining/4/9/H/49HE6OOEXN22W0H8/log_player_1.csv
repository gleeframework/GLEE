I'm going to try to get a good share early on, knowing that the money will be worth less to me with each round.  I'll offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all. The money is worth less to me with each round, so it's not worth risking another round just to get a little more."
