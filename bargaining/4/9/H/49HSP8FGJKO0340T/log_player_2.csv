Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The pot is shrinking fast. I'm standing firm on this. It's a good deal for you considering the circumstances! 
# Bob gain: 480000

**Reasoning:**

The game is reaching a critical point.  Here's why accepting is the best (and possibly last) good option:

* **Shrinking Pie:**  With each round, the money is worth significantly less for both of us, but especially for me. Delaying further significantly hurts my potential gains.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her message suggests she's unlikely to budge further. Holding out for a significantly better offer is risky. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Only 7 rounds remain. If I reject this, there's a real chance we'll both walk away with nothing.

While not ideal, accepting secures a reasonable sum before inflation erodes it further."
