**Reasoning:**

Alice is still stubbornly clinging to a larger share, even though the pot is shrinking.  While her offer is moving in the right direction, it's too slow. By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm serious about a fairer split, especially with the increasing impact of inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 507562.5,
""alice_gain"": 492437.5,
""message"": ""Alice, it's time to be realistic. This is a 50/50 split after accounting for the inflation we've already experienced. Let's close this deal before the money loses even more value.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong stance:**  By now, it's clear that Alice is aiming for a larger share.  This offer, while generous to Alice considering the inflation, firmly establishes a near-even split as the baseline for negotiation.
* **Time pressure:**  With each round, the decreasing value of the money adds pressure. This offer emphasizes the need for a quick resolution before the potential winnings dwindle further. 
* **Clear communication:**  The message directly addresses the shrinking value and proposes a clear solution - a 50/50 split of the money's *current* worth. This leaves no room for misinterpretation."
