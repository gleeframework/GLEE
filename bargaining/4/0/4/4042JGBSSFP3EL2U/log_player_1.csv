"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it a little more evenly, but still give me a slight advantage for making the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you such a large share. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially since it's not much more even than the initial offer. I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly. No more negotiating, let's finalize!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to meet Bob in the middle and end the game."
