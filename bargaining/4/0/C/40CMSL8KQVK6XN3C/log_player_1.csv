"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount in the first round, hoping to maximize my own gain and set the tone for the rest of the game. My message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, let's do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You think you can lowball me now? I'll do better than that!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's still too skewed in his favor. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but still aiming to keep a slight edge for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving you the upper hand that easily!""
}
```

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the fifth round, I'll make a new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but this time it's my turn to be generous!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and this offer is a slight compromise from my previous one."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm not budging, you're going to have to make a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the sixth round, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not budging? I'll make you an offer you can't refuse!""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still not favorable enough for me. I'm trying to psyche him out and make him think I'm willing to make a more generous offer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the seventh round, I'll make a new offer:

 ""message"": ""50/50, it's time to split the difference!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a perfectly balanced split, and this offer is a clear 50/50 proposition. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the deal."
