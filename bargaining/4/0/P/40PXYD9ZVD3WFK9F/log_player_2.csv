"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is in your best interest considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This offer leaves us both with a decent share considering the inflation will only get worse.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a much fairer deal. I'm losing money with each round, and this is becoming unreasonable. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, this offer benefits us both.  The longer this goes on, the less your share is worth. Let's be practical.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking, and my share keeps shrinking. This offer is the most sensible option for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, Alice's offer is becoming more reasonable as the rounds progress.  The longer I wait, the more pressure is on me to make a deal, and her offers are unlikely to get drastically better for me."
