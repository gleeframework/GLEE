I'm going to offer Bob a very small amount, just $1. This is a greedy move, but the first round offers no real risk to me, as I'm unlikely to have an offer made to me that's better.  Let's see what Bob does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems tempting to take the $1, I know that the inflation will continue to erode my potential gains. I need to hold out for a better deal. I'm not going to be easily taken advantage of."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob slightly, to $10. While it's still heavily skewed in my favor, this shows some goodwill and might make Bob more likely to accept. Remember, the inflation is working against me, so I need to find a balance between getting a good share and closing the deal before I lose too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 999990 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. While it's a significant increase from the previous round, I'm still losing a substantial amount of money due to inflation. I'm confident that I can hold out for a better deal, even if it means facing more rounds.  I'm not giving in to Bob's pressure tactics."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999900, ""bob_gain"": 100}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, this time to $100. While it still heavily favors me, it's a significant jump from my previous offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate. I need to find a balance between being fair and ensuring I get a good deal before the inflation eats away at my potential gains.  Let's see if this offer is enough to get Bob to the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  The inflation is really starting to hurt now, but I'm confident that I can hold out for a better deal. Bob is clearly trying to pressure me by making a large jump in his offer, but I'm not going to be swayed. I'm still holding out for a deal that's more equitable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This time I'm offering Bob $1,000. The inflation is taking a serious bite out of my potential gains, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal than Bob's last offer. It's a risky move, but I think I can still negotiate a more favorable outcome.  This offer shows that I'm taking the inflation seriously but also that I'm willing to make a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  The inflation is getting worse, and my potential gains are dwindling rapidly.  But I'm not giving up. Bob clearly thinks he has me cornered, but I'm not going to be pushed around. I'm going to continue negotiating for a better deal.  I know I can still get a better outcome for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to make a significant jump in my offer to Bob, giving him $100,000. The inflation is extremely serious at this point, so I need to secure a deal before I lose even more. This is a major compromise on my part, but I think it's a necessary one to avoid getting nothing.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm serious about reaching an agreement and that he'll reciprocate with a similar willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one, as I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation.  However, Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. I'm not ready to give in just yet.  I need to try and see if I can get a better deal before time runs out.  While I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm still hoping I can secure a more favorable deal before the game is over.  I'm going to try and hold out for a bit longer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  We are running out of time, and the inflation is hitting us both hard.  At this point, a fair division is the best way to secure some money for both of us.  This offer shows that I'm committed to reaching an agreement and that I'm willing to compromise."
