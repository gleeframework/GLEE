"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money to start with. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $5000 in this round is equivalent to $4000 in the first round. Not bad!

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to meet in the middle just yet. I want a bit more than half!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the middle, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still trying to get a bit more than Bob. Let's see if he'll meet me in the middle this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer to the middle, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Let me calculate the equivalent value of my potential gain in the first round... Ah, I see that $4000 in this round is equivalent to around $2,060 in the first round. Not bad, but I was hoping for a bit more.

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the deal. Better to get something than to risk getting nothing!"
