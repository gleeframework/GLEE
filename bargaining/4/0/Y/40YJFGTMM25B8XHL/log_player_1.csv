"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a bit more, eh?

I'm not impressed by his negotiating skills, but I'll consider the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give him an even bigger share, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make another offer!

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give you the majority of the money. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give Bob the lion's share just yet!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to settle for a compromise, I want more 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting a bit more aggressive!

Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth significantly less, and Bob's gain is even more reduced. I'm not willing to give him a bigger share, especially since he's not willing to compromise.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob, or I might try to squeeze him harder in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make another offer!

Considering the continued inflation, I'll try to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's call a truce, Bob. I'm willing to split it 50-50, but I'm not going to give you more than that.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a fair and equal split, but I'm not going to give in to Bob's demands. It's time for him to meet me halfway!"
