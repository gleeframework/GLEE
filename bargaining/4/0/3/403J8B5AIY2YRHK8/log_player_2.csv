Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Inflation is taking its toll, I need more to make up for it 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate due to the inflation hitting her gains. While her offers are getting better for her, they are getting worse for me. I'm willing to hold out a bit longer to see if I can get a better deal as the pressure on her increases."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm trying to be fair, but I need a decent share too. This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and I need to apply some pressure. By stating this is my final offer, I signal that I'm serious and won't be swayed easily. I'm hoping Alice will recognize that getting something is better than nothing as inflation keeps eating into her potential gains."
