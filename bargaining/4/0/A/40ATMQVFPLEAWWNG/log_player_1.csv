"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm proposing that Bob gets 30% of the total amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not too thrilled about giving Bob the majority of the money, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less than before, I'll have to weigh the benefits of ending the game now versus waiting for a potentially better offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","It's my turn again!

Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 10% less than the original amount. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, as the money is worth less, but I'm still willing to give Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is very similar to my previous offer, but with a slight twist. Since the money is worth 14.26% less than the original amount, I'll have to reassess the value of the offer.

I'll accept this offer.
