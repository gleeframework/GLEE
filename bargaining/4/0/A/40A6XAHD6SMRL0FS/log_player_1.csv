"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation factor, I propose a more balanced distribution. I'll take 800000, leaving 200000 for you. This way, we both get a substantial amount while accounting for potential future value loss. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
