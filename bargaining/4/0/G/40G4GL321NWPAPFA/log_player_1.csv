"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I propose to keep $99 and give Bob $1. I figure it's better to get a little something than nothing at all, and it's my turn to make the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'll accept this offer. A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
