"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, reflecting our contributions. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Given that the money is now worth 10% less due to inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. A 60/40 split in Bob's favor is not acceptable to me, especially considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split""}\n\nI'm making a new offer, taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of the money by 10% over the past two rounds. I believe a 58-42 split in my favor is a more reasonable offer at this point, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair compromise. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise.  I'll take a smaller share, but I think we both need to be more reasonable with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer in Round 4. Given that the money is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round due to inflation, I believe that further negotiations may not yield a significantly better outcome. Bob has made a concession by offering a smaller share, and I think it's time to compromise and accept this offer to avoid further devaluation of the money."
