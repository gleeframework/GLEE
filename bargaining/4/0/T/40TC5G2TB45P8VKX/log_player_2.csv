Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has strong elements of the classic ""Ultimatum Game"" where waiting can be disadvantageous. Here's why I accept, even though it's far from ideal:

* **Severe Inflation:** My buying power is eroding rapidly.  A 59.04% reduction means I'm getting less than half the value compared to Round 1.
* **Alice's Pattern:** Alice is clearly aware of the inflation and is exploiting it. She's unlikely to offer a better deal, knowing my position weakens each round.
* **Something is Better than Nothing:** While $3,800 is far from the potential $5,000, it's still better than the continued devaluation I face by rejecting and potentially getting a worse offer later."
