"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of my potential gain has decreased, making the offer less appealing.

I will reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the value of my potential gain has decreased significantly. However, I need to consider the fact that Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round, making it a relatively more attractive option.

I will accept this offer.
