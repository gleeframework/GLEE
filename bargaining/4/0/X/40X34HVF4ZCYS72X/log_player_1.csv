"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I want a bit more for myself. It's a good starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, but I still need to make the most of it.

I'll reject this offer. My gain of 40 is worth 5% less than my initial 50, so it's not as appealing as it seems. I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep the majority. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth even less, and I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer. Bob is getting a larger share, but I'm not convinced it's enough considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I'm not willing to give up more. This is my final offer, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob the majority, but I'm not willing to compromise further. It's a fair offer considering the inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
