Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value, I'm not. I'll take a bit more.

# Bob gain: 65

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting the offer. With the inflation, my gains are significantly reduced with each round, so it's better to accept before I lose even more."
