"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original amount, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice.  No need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50% split, especially since the money is already losing value due to inflation. I want to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the total amount is now worth 90% of the original 100$. I'll aim to get a larger share of this reduced amount.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. This is getting ridiculous. If we don't come to an agreement soon, we'll both lose out! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit better than the previous offers, but I'm not convinced I'm getting a good deal. I'll think carefully...

After some consideration, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 55% share, especially since the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I want to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really biting now, and the money is worth only 72.9% of the original amount.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you more, but we need to find a middle ground.  If we keep going like this, we'll both end up with nothing! 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit better than the previous offers, but I'm still not convinced I'm getting a good deal. However, I'm also getting a bit worried that if we don't agree soon, we'll both end up with nothing.

After some thought, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the 65% share, even though it's not ideal. At least I'll get something out of it, and it's better than walking away with nothing."
