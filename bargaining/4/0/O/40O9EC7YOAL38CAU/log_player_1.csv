Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for the majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, I'm not sure I can do better in the next round due to the inflation effect. This offer is a fair split, and I'm happy to accept it."
