I'll reject this offer because, despite the decreasing value, I believe I can negotiate for a larger share. The gap in our inflation rates may prompt Bob to be more flexible in subsequent rounds.

Given the significant loss in value due to inflation and the fact that Bob is now offering an equal split, it seems reasonable to accept this offer before the value decreases further.

You get $50, Bob gets $50.
Congratulations, you have divided the $100!

I'm glad we could reach an agreement before the value decreased further. It was a strategic game, and I believe we both played reasonably, given the circumstances. The inflation element added a layer of urgency and complexity to our negotiations."

Given the significant decrease in value and Bob's final offer, I will reject it because accepting such a low amount after so many rounds of negotiation doesn't seem reasonable. I'll take my chances on further negotiations, hoping Bob will reconsider or that I can propose a better split.

I'll accept this offer. Given the drastic decrease in value and considering we're more than halfway through the rounds, accepting this split seems more prudent than risking further devaluation.

While the outcome isn't the most favorable for me, I believe accepting the offer at this stage was the wisest decision, given the rapid devaluation of the money. The game highlighted the importance of timing and the impact of external factors like inflation on negotiations."
