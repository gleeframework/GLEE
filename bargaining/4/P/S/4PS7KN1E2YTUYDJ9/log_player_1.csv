Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite cheeky! I'm more than fair, but time is money. Let's settle this quickly. 60/40 seems reasonable considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
