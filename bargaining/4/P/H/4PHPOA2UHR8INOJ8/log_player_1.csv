"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion. The message is a friendly and optimistic one, trying to set a positive tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a smaller share, but still a decent chunk! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the numbers are:

* Alice's share: 200,000 x 0.9 = 180,000
* Bob's share: 800,000 x 0.9 = 720,000

Considering the significant difference in the proposed shares, I'll reject this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a fair split that's reasonable and balanced!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to find a middle ground that's more equitable and reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still the one who's going to get the majority 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original amount, the numbers are:

* Alice's share: 300,000 x 0.7279 = 218,370
* Bob's share: 700,000 x 0.7279 = 508,530

Considering the significant difference in the proposed shares, I'll reject this offer. I'd like to make another counteroffer in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, 50/50 split, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both equal shares of the money. I'm hoping this will be a fair and reasonable offer that Bob will accept."
