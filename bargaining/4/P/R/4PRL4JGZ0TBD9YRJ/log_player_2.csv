"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept an offer where I only get 30% of the money, especially since the money will be worth less in the next round.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money fairly.  Let's end this before the value of the money drops further.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob. This is your last chance for a decent deal. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less for me, I still think I can get a better deal in the next round.  Alice is showing she wants to take advantage of my inflated losses, so I'll keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's end this with an even split.  We're both losing money with each round.""
}
