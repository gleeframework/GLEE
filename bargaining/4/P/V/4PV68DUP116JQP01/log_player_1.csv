Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid the inflation.  I'm willing to take 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%. Let's see what he says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although Bob's offer isn't as good as my initial proposal, it's still a decent deal. With the inflation in effect, accepting his offer ensures I get something, and the chance of getting a better deal later is slim."
