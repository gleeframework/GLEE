"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a 50/50 split, which seems reasonable considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
