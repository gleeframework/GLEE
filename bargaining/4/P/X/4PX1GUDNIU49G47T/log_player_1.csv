Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation rates. It gives you a better share than my previous offer, and it allows us to finish this game quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
