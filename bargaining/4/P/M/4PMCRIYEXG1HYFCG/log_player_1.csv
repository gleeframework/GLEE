"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair starting point, as it offers a 60/40 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I can't afford to accept it. It's worse than the first round, and I know the money will continue to depreciate.  I'm willing to take a risk and see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the inflation and that Bob rejected my previous offer. I hope he'll accept this time."
