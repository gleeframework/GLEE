"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but it's not a completely unfair split.  I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to take it and avoid the risk of getting less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is essentially a mirror image of my initial offer, but with the inflation disadvantage, it's much less appealing.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share slightly, but still maintaining a significant advantage. With the inflation effect kicking in, I hope Bob will be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risk getting an even worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very tempting, but I'm still going to reject it. While his offer has improved from last round, the inflation is really biting into my earnings.  I'm going to try to hold out for a better deal in the next round. The risk is high, but the potential reward is worth it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still holding out for a sizable chunk of the money. Inflation is eating away at our earnings, and I think Bob is starting to feel the pressure.  I believe he'll be more willing to accept an offer closer to 50/50, but I'm not ready to go that far yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a difficult one. While the inflation is hitting me hard, I'm still going to reject this offer.  Bob's offer is closer to what I'm willing to accept, but I believe there's still room to negotiate.  I think I can get closer to a 50/50 split, especially as the inflation continues to erode the value of the money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm feeling the pressure of the inflation now, but I'm still holding out for a larger share. This offer is much closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm still confident that I can push for a little more. I think Bob is also feeling the squeeze of the inflation, so I'm hoping he'll be more open to this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision. The inflation is taking a heavy toll on my potential earnings, and I'm starting to feel the urgency of the situation.  While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, Bob's offer is the closest we've been to that, and with only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned I won't get a better deal.  I'm going to accept this offer and cut my losses."
