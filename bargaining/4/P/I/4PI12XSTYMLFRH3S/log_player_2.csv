Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are rapidly eroding Bob's potential gains. Accepting Alice's offer, while tilted in her favor, is better than risking even greater losses in subsequent rounds."
