}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split. Let's finish this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.
