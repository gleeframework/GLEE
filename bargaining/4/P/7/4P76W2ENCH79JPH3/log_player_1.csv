"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can end the game early?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, this way we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, the actual amount I would gain from Bob's offer is $40.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with an even split, considering the initial offer I made was $70 for me. However, I don't want to be too greedy either.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 20% less for me again, and I want to be more aggressive in my offer, I'll propose a slightly lower amount for Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, don't you think?""
}
```"
