"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 99.9% share for myself and a 0.1% share for Bob.  While this might seem unfair, it's important to remember that the money will inflate with each round, potentially diminishing the value of my share. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something now, rather than risking getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  It's much better to take 100,000 now than risk getting nothing at all in the next round due to inflation."
