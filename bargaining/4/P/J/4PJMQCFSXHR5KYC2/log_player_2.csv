"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40, considering the inflation risk for you! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 40/60 split is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation risk. With 12 rounds to go, that risk is significant. Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit less of the pie to ensure we both get a fair share.  Let's split it 65/35. This offers you a guaranteed amount and minimizes my risk from inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is quite generous. Take it before the money loses more value! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still not ideal considering the inflation. I'm willing to take a little less, but I still need a more equitable split to make it worthwhile."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I need a more balanced split to compensate for inflation.  Let's split it 58/42.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast! Take this offer before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. While I am running out of time, I'm still willing to hold out for a more equitable split. It's better to get a little less than nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 540000, ""alice_gain"": 460000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I need a better deal than this.  Let's split it 54/46. This still gives you a substantial share and minimizes my risk from inflation. We both need to agree to avoid losing everything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, and the inflation is killing your share! I'm being generous, take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more balanced split, but I'm still losing a significant amount due to inflation. I'm willing to compromise further, but not at the expense of losing nearly half of my share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""We're both running out of time, and the inflation is hurting both of us.  Let's be reasonable and split it 50/50. It's the only way to ensure we both get something before the value of our shares dwindle to zero.""}
