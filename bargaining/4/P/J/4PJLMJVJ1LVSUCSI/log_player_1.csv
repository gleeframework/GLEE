"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share to get the game started, while keeping most of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I think I should accept this offer. It's a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the current value of the money.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
