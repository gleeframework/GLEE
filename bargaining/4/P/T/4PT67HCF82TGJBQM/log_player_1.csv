"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this time, but I'm still generous! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better. Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $550,000, which is a slightly more even split than before, and I'll take $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth even less than before. I need to be careful about accepting an offer that's still quite lopsided.

However, I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with nothing. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, taking $300,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
