"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I do think Bob's offer is a bit too generous, considering I was initially willing to give him 40 dollars.

I'll make a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50-50 is a more reasonable split, considering the initial proposal was 60-40.""}

I'll wait for Bob's response."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering my initial proposal.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me 55 dollars and Bob 45 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we both need to be flexible to reach a good outcome before the inflation hits us too hard. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain more significantly, I'm willing to compromise. However, I still think I deserve a slightly better deal.

I'll make a counteroffer:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, but I think I deserve a slight advantage given the initial proposal. How about 52-48?""}

I'll wait for Bob's response."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway and accept a 50-50 split. Let's end this before the inflation gets any worse.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving me 50 dollars and Bob 50 dollars. I'm trying to be more flexible and willing to compromise to reach an agreement."
