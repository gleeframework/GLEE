This is a tough one!  While I'd prefer to get a higher amount, Bob is clearly playing hardball and taking advantage of the inflation working against me. 

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Time Pressure:** We're at round 6 with only 6 rounds remaining. If I keep rejecting, we risk hitting round 12 and getting nothing. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I manage to get a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the inflation will continue to eat away at my share.  
* **Bird in Hand:**  Accepting a guaranteed $40 is better than gambling and potentially ending up with nothing.

It's frustrating to accept a lower amount, but in this scenario, it's the most logical choice to avoid a worse outcome."
