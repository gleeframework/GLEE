"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
I propose that I get 900,000$ and Bob gets 100,000$.  This is a fair initial offer, as it gives me a majority share while still giving Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is much lower than my initial proposal, I am willing to accept it due to the inflation affecting my potential gains.  It's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting offers."
