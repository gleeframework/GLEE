"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but it wasn't quite fair considering the stakes. This offer is still heavily in my favor, but it accounts for the time pressure and gives you a larger share than your previous offer, even with inflation factored in. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a point where inflation will significantly erode the value of your potential winnings. I'm offering a larger share than your last offer, even considering the devaluation. Let's be pragmatic and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me. While the offer is getting better, accepting now would still give her the lion's share.  The inflation is hurting, but rushing into a bad deal will hurt more in the long run. I need to show I'm serious about getting a fair share, even with the time pressure."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm holding firm. This offer ensures a fairer split and leaves us both with a considerable sum. Inflation is a factor, but so is fairness. Let's be reasonable and end this.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly lowering my demand to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm holding firm above 50% to demonstrate I'm serious about a fair deal. Alice's offers are slowly increasing, suggesting she's feeling the pressure. I'm betting she'll be more amenable to a deal as we get closer to the deadline and the inflation continues to bite into my potential earnings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's time to get real. Inflation is eating away at your potential gains with every passing round. This offer is generous considering the circumstances. Take it while you still have a sizable sum to gain. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is really laying the inflation guilt trip on thick now, but I can't afford to cave. Her offer is better, but still heavily favors her. Importantly, she's moving in larger increments now (100k jumps), showing my persistence is having an impact. I need to hold my ground a bit longer to push her towards a more equitable split.  The risk of getting nothing is becoming real, but the potential loss from accepting this offer outweighs that risk at this stage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a fair split and avoids further losses for both of us. Take this offer – it's a win-win at this point.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making another small concession to signal that I'm willing to negotiate. This keeps the door open for a deal and prevents a stalemate. 
* **Highlighting Shared Losses:**  By emphasizing ""losses for both of us,"" I'm reminding Alice that time is running out for her too. Even though she's not affected by inflation, a no-deal outcome helps nobody.
* **Projecting Confidence:** I'm using a firm tone and presenting this offer as a ""take it or leave it"" deal. This could make Alice more likely to accept, fearing that I might not budge any further. 

The next few rounds are critical. I'm hoping this offer, combined with the increasing pressure of the deadline and my persistent stance, will convince Alice to agree to a more equitable split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing some desperation creeping in. You're right, we need to stop wasting time, but not on your terms. This offer is my final compromise. Take it, or watch your share dwindle further. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing psychological games now, trying to make me doubt myself. It's working to a degree – the pressure is intense. However, her offer, while improved, is still not acceptable.  She called it her ""final compromise,"" but that's likely a bluff.  She stands to lose a lot if we don't reach a deal. 

It's a huge gamble, but I have to counter with a strong move to show I'm not backing down."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split. No more games.  Accept this and we both win.  Reject it, and we both get NOTHING.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Ultimate Bluff:** I'm going all-in. By offering a perfectly equal split, I'm calling Alice's bluff and shifting the pressure entirely onto her. If she rejects this, it proves she was never negotiating in good faith.
* **Highlighting the Stakes:** I'm explicitly stating that rejecting this offer means zero for both of us. The risk of getting nothing is very real now, and I need to make her feel that. 
* **Appealing to Logic:**  At this point, emotion and posturing are irrelevant.  A 50/50 split is the most logical solution. It's clean, simple, and avoids further losses from inflation.

This is a high-risk, high-reward play. If Alice is rational, she'll understand that accepting this offer is the only way to guarantee a significant gain. If she's driven by greed, however, we both lose."
