Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm holding firm. This offer ensures a fairer split and leaves us both with a considerable sum. Inflation is a factor, but so is fairness. Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is heavily underestimating the impact of inflation on his own gains. While his offer might seem appealing on the surface, the longer this goes on, the less his share is actually worth. I'm betting that as the rounds progress, he'll become more desperate to make a deal, giving me more leverage."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is finally starting to feel the heat of inflation, but he's still overvaluing his position. While his offer has inched closer to a more balanced split, it's still not enough to offset the losses he's incurring with each passing round. My leverage is increasing, and I'm willing to bet he'll become more amenable to my terms soon."

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split. No more games.  Accept this and we both win.  Reject it, and we both get NOTHING. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's finally happened! Bob has cracked under the pressure of inflation. While a 50/50 split wasn't my ideal outcome, we're down to the wire. Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant sum and avoids the catastrophic outcome of walking away with nothing.  It's a gamble to push further, and at this point, the risk outweighs the potential reward."
