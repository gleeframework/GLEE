"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'm effectively getting 460,000 in real terms. Bob's offer is still a 48/52 split, which is not too far off from my original offer. I'll accept this offer.
