"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my gain accordingly.

With the new offer, my gain would be 70% of $7,000, which is $4,900.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
