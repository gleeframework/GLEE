Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are barely budging.  We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is severely impacting the value of her share. It's time to push our advantage slightly."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time.  50/50 is the only fair split at this point. Take it or leave it, but the value for you decreases with every passing round."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now past the halfway point and Alice's offers are not reflecting the urgency of the situation. A 50/50 split is the fairest offer given the inflation working against her. By taking a firm stance, we increase the pressure on Alice to accept a reasonable deal before time runs out for both of us."
