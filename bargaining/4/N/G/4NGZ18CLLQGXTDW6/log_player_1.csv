"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly in half to start. You can propose a better deal if you want.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, which is a decent starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still not bad, but I can do better than 2.33:1. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less again, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 1.5:1 ratio, which is a bit more favorable to Bob. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a good chunk of the money 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating away at our potential earnings! Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering the value of the money is decreasing. I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of him. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try a 50/50 split. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to leave anything on the table.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 1:1 ratio, which is a fair split considering the decreasing value of the money. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
