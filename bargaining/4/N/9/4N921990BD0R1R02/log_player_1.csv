"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 20% share, which is a relatively generous start. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 40-60, a compromise 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, my 80% share is still 8000$. However, Bob's 20% share in the first round was 2000$, but due to inflation, it's now worth 10% less, which is 1800$. In this round, Bob is offering me 6000$, which is more than my original 8000$. I'll accept this offer to get more money.
