Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage, but her offers are getting worse for her with each round. While inflation is hurting my potential gains, I need to hold firm. Accepting an offer below 50% is a last resort."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Alice is being incredibly stubborn, and the offer is only slightly worse than the last one she refused. However, accepting anything below 50% sets a terrible precedent and lets her know she can walk all over me. I'm hoping that rejecting this offer will finally make her realize that she needs to negotiate fairly."
