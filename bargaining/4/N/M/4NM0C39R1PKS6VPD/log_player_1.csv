"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\nI'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share to start, hoping he'll see the value in accepting early to avoid inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. It's fair and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\nSince the money is worth 10% less now, accepting 5000 would actually be less valuable than what I initially offered Bob. I'll hold out for a potentially better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good compromise""}\nI'm adjusting my offer slightly, still aiming for a bit more than half but acknowledging the decreasing value of the money. Hoping Bob sees the reason in settling sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more to get this done.  This is fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, accepting 4500 now would be equivalent to an even lower value than what I previously offered or was offered. I'll continue to negotiate, hoping for a more favorable split that accounts for the devaluation over time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, let's settle""}\nI'm increasing my share slightly, emphasizing the urgency of settling due to the rapidly decreasing value of the money. Hoping Bob recognizes that holding out further benefits neither of us significantly."
