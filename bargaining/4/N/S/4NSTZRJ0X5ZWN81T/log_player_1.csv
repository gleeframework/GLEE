"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. I'm keeping 80% for myself, which is $80. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You could have gotten more in the first round, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see what Bob is trying to do! He's trying to take advantage of the fact that the money I gain is worth less due to inflation.

I'm not going to fall for it. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 40% of what it was in the first round, I'll offer a slightly more aggressive split to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to give you the majority! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share. Okay, I'll think carefully about this offer...

Considering the value of my gain is now worth only 51.2% of what it was in the first round, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it.

I'll choose to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money I gain is worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round, so I'll make an offer that takes into account this reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
