"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 90% now, let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $10,000, which is $9,000, and leave Bob with $1,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly. I propose a 55/45 split. This gives you a good amount, and I'll be able to get something reasonable as well. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain accordingly. 

My gain would be 45% of the current value of $10,000, which is $4,500. 

Considering the offer, I think it's a reasonable split, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
