"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a division of $5,500 for myself and $4,500 for Bob, with the message ""Let's divide fairly"". It's a reasonable offer, slightly in my favor, but still giving Bob a significant share, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in this offer and accept it to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, take it or lose more next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the threat of further inflation is significant for me, accepting $4,000, which is now worth 20% less than in the first round, seems unfair given the large disparity in the proposed division. I'm hoping that by proceeding to the next round, I can negotiate a better deal despite the devaluation of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Equal share, let's end this""}\n\nI'm offering an equal division of $5,000 for both of us, with the message ""Equal share, let's end this"". Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on my side, I believe an equal share is a fair compromise. It's a straightforward offer that aims to conclude the negotiations amicably, as further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for both of us, but more significantly for me."
