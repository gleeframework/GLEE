"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm willing to give Bob a decent chunk of the money to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new numbers, I'm not thrilled about the 300,000 I'd get, but I think it's a slightly better offer than the 240,000 I'd get if I reject and proceed to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
