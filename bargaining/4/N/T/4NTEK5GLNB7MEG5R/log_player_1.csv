"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm giving Bob the opportunity to negotiate and try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I propose an even split. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair proposal. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
