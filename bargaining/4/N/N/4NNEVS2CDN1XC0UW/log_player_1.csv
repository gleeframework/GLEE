"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered a 95/5 split, I'll meet you halfway with a 60/40 split. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
