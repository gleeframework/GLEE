"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 58-42, it's as low as I'm willing to go. Inflation is hurting me too, let's settle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still heavily in her favor. Given the faster rate of inflation for me, holding out a bit longer might push Alice to offer a more balanced deal."
