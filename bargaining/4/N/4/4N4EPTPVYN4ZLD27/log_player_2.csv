Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my new offer is a bit more generous to me, but still fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.  Let's split it 65-35 in my favor.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're trying to compensate for inflation, but I'm not affected by it. My offer is still more generous than it needs to be. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While I'd prefer more, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting. Accepting ensures I get something, and the inflation will continue to eat away at my gains."
