"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's be more realistic. This is my offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Time is running out, let's close to even this out and avoid losing more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean Bob loses significantly more value due to inflation.  He needs to try and push for a more even split in the coming rounds, otherwise, the effects of inflation will make even an ""almost even"" split in Alice's favor a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Six rounds in, and the inflation is starting to significantly eat into Bob's potential gains.  A firm stance is needed. Offering a 50/50 split is fair, and by framing it as a ""final offer"" Bob increases the pressure on Alice.  She risks losing everything if she continues to hold out for a larger share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'final offer' wasn't final, was it? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a tough game, and Bob's previous ""final offer"" bluff didn't work.  He's now in a difficult position where inflation is severely impacting his potential gains.  

While not ideal, accepting this offer gives Bob 4200 which, while significantly less than what he could have gotten at the start, is better than risking a worse offer in later rounds, or even worse, getting nothing at all if they fail to reach an agreement."
