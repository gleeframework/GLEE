"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose that I take 900,000 dollars and Bob takes 100,000 dollars.  I am trying to be fair, while still getting the majority of the money since we are both losing money each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I am losing money each round, I can still afford to wait and see if Bob will offer me a better deal in the future.  I am not willing to accept such a drastic drop in my share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer, but still keeping a substantial majority of the money. I believe this is a fair offer considering the increasing inflation, and I hope Bob will see it as such."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. While it's not my ideal outcome, the inflation is becoming increasingly significant, and waiting longer risks losing more money. A 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances."
