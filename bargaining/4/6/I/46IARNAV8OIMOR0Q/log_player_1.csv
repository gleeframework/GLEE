"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is worth 10% less, so I'd rather not accept this offer. I'll try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my share is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss.

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so I'm getting even less than in my previous offer. This offer is similar to Bob's previous offer, but with a slight adjustment. I'll accept this offer.
