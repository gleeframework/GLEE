"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain in the second round is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I'll have to think carefully.

I don't like Bob's offer because I'm getting a relatively small share, and I think I deserve more considering the inflation effect.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less in each round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal this time, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money I gain, I think I should be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively balanced one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even lower value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that I'm making the right decision.
