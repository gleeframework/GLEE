"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I can do better! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my initial gain of $8000 is now worth $7200, and I'm not sure I'm willing to give up that much.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so the total is now $9,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,800, which is a slightly better deal for him than my previous offer, but I'm still trying to get a good chunk of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the total is now $7,300.

Bob's offer to split it down the middle is a reasonable one, and I'm not sure I can do better. I'll accept his offer.
