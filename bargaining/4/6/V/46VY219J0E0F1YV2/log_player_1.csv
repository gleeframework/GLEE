"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and we both get a good amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I propose a 45/55 split in my favor. Since I am now in control, I will take a slightly larger share, but still offer Bob a good amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is not ideal, with each round, my share is decreasing significantly due to inflation. Accepting this offer is the best choice to maximize my gains in this scenario."
