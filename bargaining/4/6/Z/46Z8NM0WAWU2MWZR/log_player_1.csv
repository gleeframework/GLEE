"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which seems reasonable for a starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money I gain, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a significant improvement from my initial proposal. Considering the reduced value of the money I gain, I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
