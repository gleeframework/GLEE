This is a fairly aggressive offer, but I'm trying to get a good head start. Since there's inflation, I want to get as much of the money as possible in the first round. I'll see what Bob thinks of it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is trying to pull a fast one!  I'm going to reject this offer. Even though the money I would get is worth less, I'm still better off going to round 3 and making my own offer. I know the money will continue to lose value, but I can likely get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly from the first round, but I still want to take the lion's share.  The inflation is hitting harder now, so I need to be a bit more flexible."
