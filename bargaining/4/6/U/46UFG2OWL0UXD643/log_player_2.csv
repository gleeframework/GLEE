"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I want to see how you respond. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point. It's better to see what Alice's offers are like before settling for anything.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  We both get a decent amount, and we can move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair split considering the inflation.  Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even with the 36% inflation, 50% is still a decent gain for me. Alice's message implies she's willing to settle, so it's probably best to accept and move on."
