"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me a majority of the money, which is a good starting point, but I'm leaving some room for Bob to potentially accept it. It's a relatively aggressive offer, but not overly so, given the inflation disadvantage Bob faces."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is more equitable, but I'm still in a better position due to the inflation affecting him more than me. I can likely get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500} 
```

This offer keeps the balance in my favor, but I'm willing to be more reasonable, knowing Bob's money is depreciating more quickly. I believe this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept while still leaving me a sizable portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly more favorable to him due to the inflation, but it's still a good deal for me. Accepting ensures that I get something and prevents the potential of getting nothing if I continue to reject and then Bob makes a counteroffer in the next round."
