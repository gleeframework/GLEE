I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  I figure since the money is worth more to me, I should get a slightly larger share. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Since Bob is offering a 50/50 split, it's better to accept now.  Even though the money is worth less, it's still a good deal for me.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round."
