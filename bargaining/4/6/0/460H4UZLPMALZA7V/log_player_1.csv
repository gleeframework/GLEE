"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation.

However, Bob's proposal to meet in the middle is a reasonable one. I'll accept his offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
