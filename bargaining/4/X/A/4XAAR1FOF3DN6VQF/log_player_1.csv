"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 with a 70/30 split in favor of you, Bob. This might seem a bit generous, but remember, the value of money decreases by 10% in each subsequent round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an 80/20 split in my favor.  While we both lose value each round, I believe this split is more fair as I am taking the risk of rejection and losing 20% of the potential value. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
