"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and reasonable split to kick off the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the value of the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll still be getting $300,000. However, Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 5% less than his initial offer of $400,000, which means he's now offering me a slightly better deal than before.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if we can reach a better deal for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle, let's try to finalize this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $550,000 and Bob $450,000. The message is a friendly one, suggesting we're getting closer to a mutually acceptable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect much more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the value of the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll still be getting $450,000. However, Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 14.26% less than his initial offer of $700,000, which means he's now offering me a slightly better deal than before.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer. The 55-45 split is still a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money losing value due to inflation."
