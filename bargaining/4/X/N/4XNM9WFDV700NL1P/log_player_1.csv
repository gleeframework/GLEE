"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth $240,000 in real terms. I'm not too thrilled about it, but I'll have to decide...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since my gain is worth 40% less than in the first round (20% in the first round, and another 20% in the second round), I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I calculate that my gain of $250,000 is worth approximately $128,000 in real terms, taking into account the cumulative inflation.

It's not a great deal, but I'll have to decide...
