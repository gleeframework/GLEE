"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this proposal and ending the game early. The message is intended to appeal to his sense of fairness and reason. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
