"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject the offer.  While it's a fair split in the current round, I know that Alice's money loses value much faster than mine.  I want to try to get a better deal in a later round when the inflation has affected her more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better for both of us. Let's flip the split from last round. I know the money is losing value quicker for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'm going to accept this offer. Even though Alice's offer isn't as good as my previous proposal, the inflation is starting to hit her harder. The value of the money I'd gain is less than in the first round, but it's still a better deal than waiting and potentially losing out to a worse offer later."
