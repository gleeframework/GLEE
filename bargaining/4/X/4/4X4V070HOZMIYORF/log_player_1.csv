"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

After some thought, I'll decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation that's affecting the value of the money. Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less in each of the two previous rounds), I'll aim for a more favorable split.

Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers keep getting more aggressive!

Considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I'll have to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is relatively close to the initial split, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.

After some thought, I'll decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
