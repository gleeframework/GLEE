"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent amount while leaving me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While the money is worth less, the proposed split is still significantly worse for me than my initial offer.  I believe I can still get a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor will continue to work in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I offer Bob $280,000 and keep $720,000 for myself.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still gives me a majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my share is much lower than I initially hoped for, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer means getting something, while rejecting it risks getting nothing in the end. I'll accept."
