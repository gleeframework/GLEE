This is a good starting point. I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself, considering the inflation factor. Let's see what Alice's next offer is!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's start with a more even split, and we can adjust later if necessary.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering a less-than-fair split, and the inflation is starting to bite. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to be more realistic. We both have to account for inflation, and I think this offer is fair.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: 50/50 split, last chance before it's not worth it 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, the inflation is really starting to impact the potential gains. Accepting the 50/50 split is the safest bet to ensure I get something, and the longer we go, the more likely we both lose out."
