Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario, and I'm playing as Alice. I'm starting with a fairly aggressive proposal, taking 90% of the money. My reasoning is:

* **I want to maximize my gain:**  As the proposer, I want to take as much as possible.
* **I need to give Bob something:** I want Bob to accept, otherwise we both get nothing. 

We'll see how this strategy plays out in the following rounds, and I'll adjust accordingly!"
