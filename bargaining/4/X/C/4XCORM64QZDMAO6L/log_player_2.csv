**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that my buying power is decreasing, but she's still trying to take a significant advantage.  I need to show some firmness, or she'll keep pushing for a worse deal. By round 12, even a 50/50 split will be heavily in her favor due to the way inflation is impacting my share."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is becoming a serious factor now.  While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, the impact of inflation means waiting longer will only hurt me more. Alice knows this and is unlikely to offer anything better. Accepting now cuts my losses."
