"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I understand the time pressure, but your initial offer was too low for me.  This is more equitable.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and it's hurting your share more than mine. I'm offering a compromise. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, my share keeps shrinking and we both lose if this fails. I'm aiming for fairness, let's close this deal now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your desire for fairness, but the reality is the longer we wait, the less your share is actually worth. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are severe. While I'd ideally want a larger share, accepting a lower offer now is better than risking even greater losses in subsequent rounds."
