Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation factor.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!  
# Bob gain: 700000 
# Alice gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the 700,000, better to secure something than risk getting nothing!"
