"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to keep things interesting!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the initial $100, and I'll take the remaining $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no tricks! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value.

The offer is to split the money down the middle, which means I would get $50 and Bob would get $50. However, considering the inflation, the actual value of the money is 80% of the original value, so the effective amount I would get is 50 * 0.8 = $40.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair split and I'm not getting a bad deal considering the inflation.
