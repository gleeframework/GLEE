"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a significant sum.""
}
```

This offer is designed to be tempting for Bob while still securing a larger share for Alice. Here's why:

* **First Mover Advantage:**  Alice takes advantage of being the first to propose, setting a benchmark that favors her.
* **Greed vs. Risk:** Bob is offered a decent sum upfront. He risks getting a smaller amount if he rejects the offer and inflation kicks in.
* **Future Discounting:** Alice factors in the inflation, understanding that getting more money now is significantly better than potentially getting a slightly larger share later when it's worth less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but I also need a fair share. Let's split it 60/40.  This ensures we both have a decent outcome.  
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

While Bob's offer sounds generous, accepting this puts Alice in a significantly worse position due to inflation.  It's better to propose a counter-offer that still benefits Alice in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  My offer is fair considering the time pressure and the fact that we both lose if this drags on.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Alice emphasizes the time pressure and the fact that both parties lose value with each passing round due to inflation.
* **Shifting Baseline:** By dropping her initial demand slightly (from 650,000 to 550,000), Alice aims to make her offer seem more reasonable compared to Bob's previous 60/40 proposal.  
* **Balancing Act:** This offer still gives Alice a slight advantage but acknowledges the need for a somewhat more balanced split to encourage Bob to accept."
