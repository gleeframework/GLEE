"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less than the second round), I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```"
