"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $6,000 is worth less than I initially thought. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to get as much as I can now, while keeping in mind that Bob may make an even worse offer in the next round. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. Considering the reduced value of my share, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since it's a relatively small difference from my previous offer, and the value of my share is decreasing rapidly, I'll accept this offer.
