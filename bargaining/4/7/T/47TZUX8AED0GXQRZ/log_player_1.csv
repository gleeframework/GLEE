"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll take it and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer from Bob! Since it's a 50/50 split, I'm inclined to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
