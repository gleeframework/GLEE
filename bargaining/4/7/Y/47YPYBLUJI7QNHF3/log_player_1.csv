I'm starting with a slightly greedy proposal, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob 10%. I figure that, in the worst case, he'll reject it and I'll have a chance to propose again in the next round. But I'm also trying to gauge his reaction and see how he values fairness versus the risk of losing money to inflation."
