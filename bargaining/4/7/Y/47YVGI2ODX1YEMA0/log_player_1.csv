"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering we're starting with a large amount."
