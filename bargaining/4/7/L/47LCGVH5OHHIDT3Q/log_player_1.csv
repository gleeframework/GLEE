"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll decide to reject it. I'm hoping for a better deal next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly better deal than the 50-50 split in Round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up with me! My gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I need to be careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to accept it. The 45% gain is a bit lower than I initially wanted, but it's better than the 40% I got in the first round, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower gains due to further inflation.
