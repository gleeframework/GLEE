Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk in the first round to see if Bob is willing to accept a seemingly unfair deal.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's not ideal, getting 4000 is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds.  Inflation will keep reducing the potential gains, so I'm accepting this offer to secure at least some money."
