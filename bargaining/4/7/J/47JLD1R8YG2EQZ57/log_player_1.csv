"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 40% share. I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is a fair split, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle and split it 50/50. Let's end this game! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds like a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation has already taken a significant toll on the money's value.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Let's call it a day and split the remaining $10,000 50/50!"
