"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's still fair! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $3,000 is now worth 20% less than the $6,000 I could have gotten in the first round, and Bob's gain of $7,000 is now worth 5% less than the $4,000 I offered him.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will make a better one in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise and offer a slightly higher amount to Bob, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving up too much! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $4,200 in round 3 would be worth 51.2% of the original $6,000, which is $3,072. My gain of $4,500 in Bob's offer would be worth 75% of the original $6,000, which is $4,500.

Considering the inflation, I think Bob's offer is actually a good one, and I'll decide to accept it.
