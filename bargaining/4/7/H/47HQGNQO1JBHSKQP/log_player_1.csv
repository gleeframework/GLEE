"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'm not sure if I want to accept a slightly worse deal than the 50/50 split I proposed earlier.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
