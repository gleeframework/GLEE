"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I take the lion's share, but you still get something nice. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a mere 100,000. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share this time.  We both get a significant amount, and we can move on with this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a good deal too. This offer keeps things fair while ensuring we both walk away with substantial amounts. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent amount, and we can both move on."
