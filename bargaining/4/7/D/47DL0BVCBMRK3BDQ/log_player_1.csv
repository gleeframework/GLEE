"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively generous split, considering I'm taking the larger share. My message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60/40 split. This offer is more fair, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new offer, I'm not impressed. I'd rather not give up too much of the pie, especially since I don't know how much Bob's gain is worth to him. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counteroffer!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive move. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but still keep a decent chunk of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for more, I'm pushing back. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will blink!"
