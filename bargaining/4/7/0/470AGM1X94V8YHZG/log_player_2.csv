Round 3

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go up to 70% this round, Bob. We're both losing money with each passing turn. It's time to compromise and find a solution before the value of this money completely dwindles. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the 300,000 now, as inflation is eating away at the potential gains. It's not ideal, but it's the best option given the circumstances."
