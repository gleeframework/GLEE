"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair.  Let's work together and both get something. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a more generous offer than the one I made in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
