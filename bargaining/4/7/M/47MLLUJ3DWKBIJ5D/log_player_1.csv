"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $49 is worth 95% of $70, which is $66.35.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since he's offering a 51-49 split, I think that's a bit too close to a 50-50 split, but it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
