"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take 40% of the original amount, a fair compromise? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial proposal, but I'm not willing to give up 60% of the original amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit more generous than mine, I'll try to be more generous this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 58/42 is a fair compromise.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take 70% of the original amount, I'm willing to give you a smaller share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is getting aggressive! Taking 70% of the original amount is a big ask, and the fact that I'd only get $300,000 is not very appealing. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to take a firmer stance. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up more than 52%. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to 50%, I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of the deal! With inflation eating away at the value of the money, $200,000 is not as attractive as it used to be. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I think it's time for a more aggressive move. Since Bob is trying to get the better deal, I'll try to take control of the negotiation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up more than 40%. It's time for you to make a real compromise.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will finally accept a deal that's in my favor!"
