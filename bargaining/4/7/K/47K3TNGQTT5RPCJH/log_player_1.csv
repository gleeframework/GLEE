Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not being too generous yet. It's a fair split, but I'm keeping most of the money. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is not fair. While I understand that he wants to keep the majority, 300k is too low.  I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise.  I'm willing to take less than my initial offer, but I need more than 300,000.  This is a fair 60/40 split.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not feeling generous, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. This is a fair split, but I'm still taking the majority. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is not ideal, the money is losing value rapidly and I need to secure some of it. Accepting now means I still get a significant amount, and the risk of further inflation and losing even more is too high."
