"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced gains due to inflation, I'm not as thrilled about the offer. However, it's still a 50-50 split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round if I can avoid it. I'll accept Bob's offer.
