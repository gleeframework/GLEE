Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I propose an even 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable way to divide the remaining money, especially since the value has decreased due to inflation."

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  While the money is worth less now due to inflation, I believe a 55/45 split is a fair compromise considering I am the proposer and we have both been unwilling to accept an uneven split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62

Bob's offer is too low, and the inflation is making the money worth less and less. I need to hold out for a better deal, as the value of the money is rapidly diminishing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47}
```

I propose a 53/47 split in my favor.  Despite the ongoing inflation, I believe this offer is a fair compromise, recognizing that we're approaching the end of the game and the value of the money is quickly decreasing.  Let's come to a fair agreement before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Bob's offer is not acceptable. Inflation is rapidly diminishing the value of the money, and I believe a fair division is still possible. I will not settle for such a lopsided deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
```

With only two rounds left, I propose a 51/49 split in my favor.  This is the last offer I'm willing to make. The value of the money is dwindling fast, and I need to ensure I receive a fair portion before we both lose everything."
