"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more cautious now that the money is worth less. Since I'm getting 40, that's 40% of the original 100, but due to inflation, it's actually worth 32% of the original amount. Meanwhile, Bob is getting 60, which is 60% of the original amount, and its value is not affected by inflation.

Considering this, I think I'll reject the offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my gain is now worth 80% of the original amount. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I need to protect my interests.""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a better deal, while still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! Since the money is now worth 51.2% of the original amount, my gain of 35 is actually worth 35.68% of the original amount. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of 65 is still worth 65% of the original amount.

Considering the inflation, I think this offer is a bit too skewed in Bob's favor. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain! Since the money is now worth 51.2% of the original amount, I'll have to be even more aggressive with my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to protect my share, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it before things get even worse due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get a better share 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge toll on my potential gain! Since the money is now worth 32.77% of the original amount, my gain of 30 is actually worth 9.83% of the original amount. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of 70 is still worth 70% of the original amount.

I'm getting desperate, but I think this offer is still too skewed in Bob's favor. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really crippling my potential gain! Since the money is now worth 32.77% of the original amount, I'll have to be extremely cautious with my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to survive, but I need to get something out of this.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my previous ones, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it before things get even worse due to inflation."
