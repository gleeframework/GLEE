"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to get us closer to a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the adjustment, I'll think about it for a moment...

I accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to take $450,000, leaving Bob with $550,000. It's a slight adjustment towards a fairer split, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal!"
