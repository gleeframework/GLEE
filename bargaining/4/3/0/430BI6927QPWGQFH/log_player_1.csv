"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000, and I'll take $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: $6,000 * 0.95 = $5,700
* Bob's gain: $4,000 * 0.8 = $3,200

Considering Bob's offer, I'll gain $5,000 and Bob will gain $5,000. This is a better deal for me than my previous offer, and it's a 50/50 split, which seems fair.

I accept the offer.
