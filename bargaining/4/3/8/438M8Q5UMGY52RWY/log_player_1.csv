# Bob's message: My turn! How about a slight adjustment for a better deal? 
# Alice gain: 45

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! Let's settle for an even split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer from round 4.\n\nLet's finalize the division of the money.\n\nSince I accepted the offer, the final division will be:\n\nAlice gain: 50\nBob gain: 50\n\nHowever, due to inflation, the actual value of the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than the initial value. So, the actual value I receive is:\n\n50 * (1 - 0.271) = 36.45\n\nBob's gain remains the same, as the inflation does not affect him.\n\nThe final result is:\n\nAlice gain: 36.45\nBob gain: 50\n\nI'm glad we were able to come to an agreement before the 12 rounds were over!"
