"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money and leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's be reasonable and finish this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to wait for a better offer, as the value of my potential gain is lower due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer needs to be more aggressive to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to make the most of the decreasing value of the money."
