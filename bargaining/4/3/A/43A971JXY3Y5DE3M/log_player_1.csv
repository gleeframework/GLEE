"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the potential for inflation. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original value.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, which is equivalent to $50 in the original value (since 60% of $100 is $60, and $60 is worth 80% of the original value due to inflation). Bob will get $60, which is equivalent to $63 in the original value (since 40% of $100 is $40, and $40 is worth 80% of the original value due to inflation).

I'll accept this offer.
