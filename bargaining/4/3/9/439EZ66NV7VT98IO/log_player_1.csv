"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total amount, which is $200,000. I'll take the remaining 80% for myself, which is $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Considering the effects of inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth only 80% of the original $800,000 I would have gotten in Round 1. And Bob's gain of $550,000 is actually worth only 95% of the original $580,000 he would have gotten in Round 1.

In this light, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject Bob's proposal and proceed to Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering Bob 30% of the total amount, which is $300,000. I'll take the remaining 70% for myself, which is $700,000."
