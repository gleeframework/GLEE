Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous and offering Bob a small portion.  This allows me to secure a large share of the money while leaving room for negotiation later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me, and I don't see any reason to accept it. I'm still in a position to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still offering a good deal to Bob.  He's likely to accept this, as it's a much better deal for him than the last round."
