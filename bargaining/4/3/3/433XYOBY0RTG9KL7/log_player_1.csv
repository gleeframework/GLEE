"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $200,000, you can't refuse this generous offer!""
}
```

I'm starting with a strong offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation. I want to try to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a toll, I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting less, I'm getting more, it's only fair!""
}
```

I'm taking a slightly more aggressive stance, offering Bob a smaller share, but hoping he'll still accept to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be a bit more reasonable this time.  I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need a fair amount too. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger toll, and I need to adjust my strategy. Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is actually a good one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as I think it's a reasonable split considering the circumstances. I'll take $400,000 and call it a day!"
