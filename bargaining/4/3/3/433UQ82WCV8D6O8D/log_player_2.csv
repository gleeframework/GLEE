""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  We both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
