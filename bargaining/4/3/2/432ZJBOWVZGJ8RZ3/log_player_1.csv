"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority this round.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 5% less, the total amount is now $95.

Bob's proposal is a 50-50 split, which is a decent compromise. I'm not sure if I can do better, so I'll accept this offer.
