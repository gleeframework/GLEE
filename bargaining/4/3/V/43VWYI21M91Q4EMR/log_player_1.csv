"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation effect, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here it is:

```
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal this time, but still keeping it relatively balanced."
