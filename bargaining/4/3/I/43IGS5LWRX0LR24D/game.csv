6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This ensures we both get a significant amount. What do you say?,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's be reasonable and move this along.",Bob,2,

5750.0,4250.0,"I understand you want a bigger share, but 55/45 is too much for me.  I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 57.5/42.5. This is still a good deal for both of us, and it reflects the inflation impact more fairly.  Let's get this done.",Alice,3,
