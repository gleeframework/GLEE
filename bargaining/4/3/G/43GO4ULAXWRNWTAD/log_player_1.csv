Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with $20."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my offer in the second round would be worth 80% of what my original offer was.

Bob's offer is $50, which is worth $40 (80% of $50).

I'd rather get $64 than $40, so I'll reject Bob's offer.
