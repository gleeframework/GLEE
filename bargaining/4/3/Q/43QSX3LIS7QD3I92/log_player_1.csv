"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is a relatively fair share. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's an interesting offer from Bob. He's trying to take a large share of the money, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to give him 70% of the total amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and getting a fair amount for myself. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting more and more one-sided! Giving him 80% of the total amount is not acceptable to me. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm taking a bigger share of the money this time, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Giving him 60% of the total amount is a more reasonable share, but I'm still not sure if it's the best deal for me.

I'll think about it for a moment... and decide to...
