"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll be willing to accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a fair share! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, my gain of 20 is now worth 18 dollars.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob taking the majority, but I suppose it's a decent offer. I'll accept this proposal to avoid further negotiations and the continued erosion of the money's value.
