"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a significant gain. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll let you know my reasoning behind the decision if you'd like. As Bob, I rejected the offer because I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in subsequent rounds. Although the money's value decreases over time due to inflation, I'm hoping to get a larger share of the remaining amount to offset the loss in value. With 12 rounds available, I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a potentially better offer.\n\nPlease let me know Alice's next move or if you'd like me to elaborate on my thought process!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me but still appears reasonable, considering the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This offer gives us both a considerable amount, and we can both walk away satisfied.""}\n\nPlease let me know Alice's response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair deal, Bob. This offer is close to your last and still benefits us both significantly considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll explain my reasoning behind the decision. Although the offer is closer to my previous proposal, I'm still not satisfied with the distribution. Given the inflation rates, I'm losing more value over time compared to Alice. I want to try and negotiate a better deal, considering the decreasing value of money, to maximize my gain. With 9 rounds remaining, I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a more favorable offer.\n\nPlease let me know Alice's next move or if you'd like me to elaborate on my thought process!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","In this round, I'll make another counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Since I'm losing more value over time, I'll try to increase my share while still making the offer reasonable for Alice. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this offer is more balanced. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value.""}\n\nPlease let me know Alice's response!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value quickly. This is my final offer - it's a good deal for you considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll explain my reasoning behind the decision. Given the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I believe this offer is the best I can get. With 7 rounds remaining, the money's value will continue to drop, and I risk losing even more if I don't accept this offer. Although it's not ideal, I think it's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. I'll take the 425,000, which is still a substantial amount, rather than risking further devaluation.\n\nPlease let me know the outcome!"
