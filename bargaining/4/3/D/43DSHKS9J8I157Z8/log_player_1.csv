"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $5000 is now worth $5000 / 0.9 = $5555.56, and Bob's gain of $5000 is now worth $5000 / 0.8 = $6250.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems Bob is getting a better deal than me. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation adjustment, I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll try to take a bit more, since the money is worth less.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which I think is a fair compromise given the current economic conditions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted values considering the new inflation rates.

My gain of $5200 is worth $5200 / 0.727 = $7153.68, and Bob's gain of $4800 is worth $4800 / 0.5192 = $9263.33.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems Bob is getting a significantly better deal than me. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll try to take a bit more, since the money is worth even less.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200
}
```

I'm proposing a 58-42 split, which I think is a fair compromise given the current economic conditions."
