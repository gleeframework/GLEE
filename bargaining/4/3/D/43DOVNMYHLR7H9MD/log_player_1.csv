"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 20% share of the initial $10,000, which is $2,000. I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced split, let's see if Alice agrees 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, but I'm not thrilled about it. I'd rather not give up as much as 60% of the remaining money. However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller amount.
