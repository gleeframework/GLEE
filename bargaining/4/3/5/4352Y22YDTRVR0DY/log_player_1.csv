"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 75/25 split is more equitable, given the potential for further value loss. It allows for a reasonable gain for both of us.

# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
