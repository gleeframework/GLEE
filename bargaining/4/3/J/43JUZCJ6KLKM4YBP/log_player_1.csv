I'm going to be bold and offer Bob a very small amount, hoping he'll accept to avoid going through further rounds.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if we go through multiple rounds, but I'd rather get the bulk of the money now!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd love to have more, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome and I'm happy to accept it. There's no guarantee I'd get a better deal in future rounds."
