7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This offers a fair distribution considering the risk of inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  It still gives you a good share while recognizing that I'm taking on the risk of the next round.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
