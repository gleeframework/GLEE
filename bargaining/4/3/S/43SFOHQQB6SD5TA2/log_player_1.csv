"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This offers a fair distribution considering the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  It still gives you a good share while recognizing that I'm taking on the risk of the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
