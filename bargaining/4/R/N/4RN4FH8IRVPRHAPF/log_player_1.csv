"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the $100, and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose we split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer! I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept an even split just yet. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You said let's be fair, so I'll give you 40. Consider this a compromise.""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still a decent amount for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's both move closer to a 50/50 split. I'll take 60 this round, and we can continue to negotiate towards fairness. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to inch his way towards a 50/50 split. I'll consider this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 60% of the money just yet. I think I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more than 40. This is my final compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's close to the 50/50 split, but still gives me a slight edge. Let's see if Bob will accept this compromise."
