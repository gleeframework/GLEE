"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take 60%.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money and can start negotiating from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a slightly more aggressive offer. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken its toll, and my potential gain is now worth less.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since I'm not sure how much inflation affects him, I'll try to be cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, and I need to be strategic.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more. Can we compromise?""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, but I'm still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a bigger toll, and my potential gain is worth significantly less now.

Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. Since we're meeting halfway, I'll think carefully about it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really eating into the value of the money now, and I need to be more aggressive in my offer.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to protect my share. This is my final offer for now.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, but I'm also being cautious about leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to ensure I get a decent amount in the end. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking its toll, and my potential gain is worth significantly less now. I need to think carefully about Bob's offer.

However, considering the offer, I think I can live with it. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even smaller potential gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and hope it's a good decision."
