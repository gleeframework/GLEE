Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is running out.  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and she's likely to keep pushing for a slight advantage. I'll hold out for a better offer or propose something more agreeable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a reasonable compromise. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With only 6 rounds left, I need to make Alice realize time is a factor.
* **Slight Concession:** I've moved closer to her previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but still maintaining a slight advantage.
* **Firm Language:** The ""take it or leave it"" message adds a sense of urgency and finality, hoping to push her towards acceptance."
