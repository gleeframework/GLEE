I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer. I'm taking a large chunk, but I'm giving Bob something to avoid an immediate rejection.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more balanced, but I'm still holding out for a bigger share. I know the inflation hurts Bob more, so I'm going to try and take advantage of that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try to get as much as possible while still offering Bob a decent amount. The inflation is really hitting Bob hard now, so I think he might be more willing to accept a slightly less generous offer than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  Bob's offer is pretty fair and it's becoming clear that the inflation is starting to hurt us both significantly. It's better to take a guaranteed 500,000 than risk getting nothing at all."
