"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is now worth 20% less than the original $5000, so I'd be getting $4000, and Bob's share is worth 5% less than the original $5000, so he'd be getting $5700.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd like to reject it. I think I can do better than a 60/40 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth even less due to inflation, so I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a bit more for myself!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My share would be worth 48.8% less than the original $5000, so I'd be getting $2600.
Bob's share would be worth 14.26% less than the original $5000, so he'd be getting $4300.

Considering the offer, I'd like to reject it. I think I can do better than a 35/65 split.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth even less due to inflation, so I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to get a decent amount!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 38/62 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
