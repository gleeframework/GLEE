I'm starting with a very greedy offer!  I want to maximize my share right away, knowing that Bob's share will decrease faster.  Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a good deal for me. Even though I'm getting less than my initial proposal, it's still a large amount, and the risk of getting nothing is too high.  With each round, Bob's share decreases faster, so I don't want to risk him getting even greedier."
