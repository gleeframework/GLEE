"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me getting 800,000 and Bob getting 200,000. I think this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it 90/10, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a toll, I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain.

However, considering Bob's proposal, I think 100,000 is a relatively small amount, and I'd rather get something than nothing. I'll accept this offer, but I'm not happy about it.
