"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a fair share, and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still have $6,000 in mind as a target. Bob's offer is still quite low, but I'll consider it. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer that's a bit lower than my target of $6,000.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's settle this!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need for more negotiation! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a very good deal for me, as my gain is still $5,000, which is worth the same as it was in the first round. However, I'm not sure if Bob is willing to split it 50/50. I'll accept the offer, but I'll make sure to note that it's a bit more than I initially expected.
