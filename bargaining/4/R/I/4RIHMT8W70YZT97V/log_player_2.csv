Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice, the total value is now 90% of 100$ for me and 95% of 100$ for Alice.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice compared to the original 100$, the actual amounts are:

My gain: 50 * 0.81 = 40.5
Alice's gain: 50 * 0.9045 = 45.225

I'll accept this offer.
