"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk, but I want to be fair enough to make Bob consider accepting in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  the inflation makes it  risky to reject. Taking 250,000 is better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
