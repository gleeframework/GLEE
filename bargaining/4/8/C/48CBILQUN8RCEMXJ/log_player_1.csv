"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with $20. This is a relatively generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a good offer from me, but I'm looking for a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $10 is now worth 20% less, which is $8.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about taking only $8, especially since Bob is offering himself 90% of the remaining $100, which is worth 5% less than in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my $10 from the previous round is now worth 20% less again, making it $8.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a fair split considering the inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still want a better deal than this. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking its toll!

My gain of $40 from the previous round is now worth 48.8% less, which is approximately $20.80.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about taking $5, especially since it's worth 48.8% less than the initial $100. However, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer from Bob.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in future rounds.
