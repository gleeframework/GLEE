Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering to split the money evenly, 50/50. Let's see if Bob accepts!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is not very generous, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll think about it...

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was not very generous, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if he accepts this time!"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'm starting to get a bit worried about the time running out.

However, Bob's offer is actually quite similar to his previous one, and it's still not very generous. I'll reject it again.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, given the inflation and the fact that time is running out. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still not willing to budge. His offer is similar to the previous ones, and I'm not getting any more generous.

However, I'm starting to get a bit desperate, and I need to think about the value of the money in the future. Considering the inflation, I might as well accept this offer, even though it's not ideal.
