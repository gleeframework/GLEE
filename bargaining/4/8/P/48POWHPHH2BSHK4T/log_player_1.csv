"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to keep $900,000 and give Bob $100,000. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'll be taking the most risk by proposing first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is much worse for me than my initial offer, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I will reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still keeping a significant majority. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that the money is losing value with each passing round, and this offer is still better for him than the previous round's."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still significantly worse for me than my initial proposal. The value of the money is dropping rapidly, but I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm further reducing my share, but I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to accept. With each round, the value of the money keeps dropping, and I want to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough call, as the money keeps losing value. However, I'm still holding out hope that I can get a better deal. This offer is closer to what I'd like, but I'm not ready to accept yet. I'm hoping Bob will realize that we are both losing money with each passing round, and will be more willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm again reducing my share slightly, but I'm getting worried.  This is a significant risk as we're getting close to the end, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a deal before we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a difficult decision, and the pressure is mounting.  While the offer is getting closer to what I'd like, I still believe there's room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob will understand that with each passing round, the value of the money is decreasing significantly for both of us. I'm not ready to accept yet, but I'm also not ready to risk getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're down to the wire, and the value of the money is plummeting. I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest outcome at this point, and I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in it before we both get nothing."
