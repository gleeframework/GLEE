"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Let's see what Alice proposes next. I can do better than this!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation that will affect us both. Let's end this early!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, I've adjusted slightly, still hoping we can settle 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split,  the inflation is hitting hard.  Accepting this offer is better than risking a worse outcome in the next round."
