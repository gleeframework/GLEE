"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll get a decent chunk too 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective values are:

Alice gain: 30 / 0.95 = 31.58 (approximately)
Bob gain: 70 / 0.8 = 87.5

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob such a large majority, but I suppose it's a decent offer considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
