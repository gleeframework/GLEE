"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a small fraction of the total, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to take a more aggressive approach!

Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, and now it's worth 10% less again after the second round, my gain of $500,000 is actually worth $450,000 (90% of $500,000).

I'm not sure I like Bob's 50/50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'd rather not risk waiting for another round and potentially getting less. Let's take it!
