"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small share to start, hoping he'll accept it quickly and we both get something.  I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm trying to be generous enough to avoid unnecessary rounds.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Even though the money I gain is worth less due to inflation, I'm still hoping for a more equitable split. I'm willing to play a few more rounds to see if we can find a better solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm proposing a more even split this time, hoping to reach a compromise. I'm willing to take a significant share of the remaining money, but I think a more balanced agreement is possible.  Let's see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a more equitable split, I'm still not satisfied. I believe that with a few more rounds of negotiation, we can reach a deal where we both benefit more. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm confident we can still find a better solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. With the inflation hitting hard, I think this is the fairest solution. I'm willing to share the remaining money equally, hoping that Bob will see the value in a fair compromise. Let's see if this finally gets us to an agreement."
