"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 500,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $600,000 * 0.95 = $570,000. Since Bob's gain of 500,000 is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll reject this offer to try to get more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 2, the money was worth 95% of its original value, so in round 3, it will be worth 95% of 95% of its original value, which is 0.95 * 0.95 = 0.9025 or 90.25% of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, that means it's worth 85.74% of its original value. So, my gain of 450,000 is worth 0.8574 * 600,000 = 514,44.

I'll accept this offer since it's a better deal for me than my previous one, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds.
