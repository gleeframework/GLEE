"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you a decent chunk to get the negotiations going.""
}
```

I'm offering to keep 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, I'll take a smaller share this time. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my calculations accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting 6,000 dollars, but its value will be 90% of what it was in the previous round.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and propose a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to keep a larger share of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to keep a significant portion to make this worthwhile for me.""
}
```

I'm offering to keep 72% of the remaining value, leaving Bob with 28%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise. Will you meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my calculations accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting 6,800 dollars, but its value will be 73.9% of what it was in the first round.

I'll consider this offer and decide whether to accept it or reject it.
