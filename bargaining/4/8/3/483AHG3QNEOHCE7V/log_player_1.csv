"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, knowing that Bob might be more willing to accept a small gain than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to secure half of the money now than risk getting nothing in later rounds. Bob's offer is fair and I'm willing to accept it."
