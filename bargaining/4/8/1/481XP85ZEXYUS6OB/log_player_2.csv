"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and that's a ridiculously unfair offer!  I'll take my chances with a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
```

I'll take the lion's share this time, but I'm still offering Alice something. Let's see if she's more reasonable this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer a larger share, given the inflation and Alice's willingness to negotiate, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy.  I'll take the $100,000, which is better than nothing, and hope the next rounds don't get any worse."
