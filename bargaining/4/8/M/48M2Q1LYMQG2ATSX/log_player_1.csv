"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth 4.5% of the original $100 (since it's 5% less than 70%), and Bob's gain of 60 is worth 6% of the original $100 (since it's 10% less than 30%).

After considering this, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60% of the money, and it's worth 6% of the original $100, I'll aim to get more than that. I'll propose:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to take advantage of the fact that Bob's offer was lower than mine in the previous round."
