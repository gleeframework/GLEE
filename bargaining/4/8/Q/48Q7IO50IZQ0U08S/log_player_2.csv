"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a fair split right now, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to negotiate as the rounds go by."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than the last offer. I'm willing to give you a little less this time, but I'm hoping you'll consider accepting it. Time is running out, and we both want to get something.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  The clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, the clock is ticking and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome.  It's better than risking getting nothing at all."
