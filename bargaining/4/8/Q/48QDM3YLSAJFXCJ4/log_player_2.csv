"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can discuss a better split in the following rounds.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  We both lose value with each round, so a 50/50 split is the most logical way to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer, but it's getting closer. While a 50/50 split seems fair, I need to capitalize on the fact that Alice is losing value faster than me with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Time is ticking and we're both losing money. I'm coming closer to your offer, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go up to 400,000.  We're both losing a lot of value, so let's try to reach an agreement before we lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is losing value significantly faster than I am. Accepting 600,000 now is better than risking getting a worse offer later, especially with the time pressure."
