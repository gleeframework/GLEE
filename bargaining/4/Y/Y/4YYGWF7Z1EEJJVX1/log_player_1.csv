"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more this time, but it's still a reasonable split. Let's be fair and move on. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more than Bob, it seems!

Considering the new offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, given the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly lower than before:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less this time, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 40-60 split, which takes into account the reduced value of money due to inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
