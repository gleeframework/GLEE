Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not happy about this, but with the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly lower share if it means ending this.  Let's just get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting this offer is now Bob's best move. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob. Each round makes his potential gains significantly smaller. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a better offer in the next round isn't guaranteed, and even a slight increase in his share might be outweighed by the additional inflation.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has indicated willingness to compromise but is also feeling the pressure of inflation.  She might be less generous in future rounds.

Taking $450,000 now, even with the 34.39% decrease in value, is better than risking an even worse outcome in a later round."
