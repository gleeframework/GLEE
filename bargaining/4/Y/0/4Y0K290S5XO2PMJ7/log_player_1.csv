Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. Inflation is hitting us both hard, but I'm willing to offer you a slightly higher share to get this done before we both lose even more.  This is my final offer. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""
}

**Reasoning:** Bob is playing hardball, but his ""final offer"" bluff shouldn't work.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** Time is running out, meaning each round significantly decreases the value of the money. This hurts Alice more, but Bob is also losing a significant amount.
* **Inflated Perception:** Bob is likely overvaluing his position. He might think Alice is desperate enough to accept any offer as the deadline approaches.
* **Counter Offer Potential:** Rejecting gives me a chance to make another counter offer. While the value decreases, I can still try to nudge the split more in my favor. 

**Important:** I need to quickly calculate an offer for the next round that's more appealing to me, but still has a chance of being accepted by Bob before we both lose out."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a critical moment. We both lose if this drags on.  This is my final offer - let's be done with it and both walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer and my previous one. It signals a willingness to compromise, but also firmness.
* **Strong Language:** Using phrases like ""critical moment"" and ""final offer"" increases the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Focus on Shared Loss:**  Reminding Bob that we BOTH lose if this fails is crucial. It emphasizes that continued stubbornness hurts him too. 

**It's a risky move, but given the rapidly decreasing value and time pressure, a strong play is necessary to avoid a complete loss.**"
