"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, I need to be more cautious. Considering that the money I gain is worth 10% less and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I think I should be more aggressive in my next offer. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk losing out on a good deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
