Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both get a bit more if we negotiate. I'll take 60, giving you 40, as a fair starting point.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
