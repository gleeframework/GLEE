Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Let's try 55 for me and 45 for you. This takes into account the inflation, and hopefully, we can both get something closer to what we want. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
