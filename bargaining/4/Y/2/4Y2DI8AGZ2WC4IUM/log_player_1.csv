"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 3:1. This might seem a bit lopsided, but remember, the value of money decreases with each round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 3:2. It's still a good deal considering the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{
