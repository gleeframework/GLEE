"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total, and I'll take the rest. This way, we both get a decent amount to start with.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split of 80% for myself and 20% for Bob, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle. Take this and we can end it here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I'd get from Bob's offer is 4000 * 0.8 = 3200.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to try to negotiate for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You met me in the middle last round, but I think I deserve more this time. I'm offering a 60-40 split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing for a 60-40 split, but I think I deserve more this time. I'll give you a 55-45 split, but that's as low as I'll go. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I'd get from Bob's offer is 4500 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 2323.2.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I still think I can get a better deal. A 55-45 split is closer to my target, but I'd like to try to negotiate for a 60-40 split or better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 60.96% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not budging on the 55-45 split, so I'm going to take a firmer stance. I'm offering a 70-30 split. This is my final offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing for a 70-30 split, but I think we can find a more balanced solution. I'm offering a 50-50 split, let's meet in the middle and end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 67.23% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I'd get from Bob's offer is 5000 * 0.332 (1 - 0.668) = 1660.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because a 50-50 split is a reasonable compromise, and I'd rather end the game now than risk getting an even worse deal in future rounds."
