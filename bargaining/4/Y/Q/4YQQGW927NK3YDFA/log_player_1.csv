"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the first offer. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and the inflation risk makes it even more appealing. It's better to take the guaranteed 5000 than to risk getting less in a later round."
