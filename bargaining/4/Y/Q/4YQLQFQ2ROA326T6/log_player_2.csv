"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. I believe this is a fair offer considering I'm the one proposing.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split it 55/45. Since the money loses value over time, it's better for both of us to agree sooner rather than later.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the time pressure, but my offer needs to be fair to me too. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\n### I will accept Alice's offer since it's getting closer to a fair split and the value of the money is decreasing with each round. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise."
