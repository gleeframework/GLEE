"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. I'll be open to negotiation in later rounds, but I'm confident this is a good initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my demand slightly to 70/30, but I'm still holding out for a larger share. Bob's offer in the last round was unacceptable, and I'm confident I can get a better deal. Remember, inflation is hitting both of us, and I believe my offer is more equitable considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not satisfied with the current offer. I'm confident I can secure a better deal in the next round. I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm willing to take the risk for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my demand again to 60/40, but this is my final offer before I risk losing even more due to inflation.  I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not satisfied with the offer. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round. Inflation is a concern, but I'm willing to take the risk for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Given the rapid inflation and the number of rounds remaining, a fair split is the best option for both of us. This way, we avoid the risk of getting nothing at all. Let's be pragmatic and ensure we both get a reasonable share."
