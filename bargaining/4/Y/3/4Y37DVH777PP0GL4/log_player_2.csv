**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing.  By continuing to reject her offers, I'm signaling that I'm willing to risk getting nothing to secure a better deal. It's a risky strategy, but with the shrinking pot, I need to push for a significant change in her position."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The longer we wait, the less we both get. I'm proposing a near-even split to end this now before we both lose out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a power play.  Alice has shown she's willing to drag this out, but the significant devaluation of the money is working against both of us.  By offering a near-even split that heavily favors me, I'm aiming to:

* **Shock her into action:** The drastic shift from my previous offer might jolt her into realizing the seriousness of the shrinking pot. 
* **Highlight the risk:** By emphasizing the potential loss for both of us, I'm increasing the pressure on her to accept a deal. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Even if she rejects this offer, it sets a new starting point for negotiation, potentially moving her away from her stubborn 58-42 stance."
