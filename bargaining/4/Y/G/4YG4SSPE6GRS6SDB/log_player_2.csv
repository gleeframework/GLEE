"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While Alice is losing value quickly, I still lose a significant amount each round. I need to negotiate for a much larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer accounts for the decreasing value and gives us both a fair share.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but this is my final offer. We need to reach an agreement before the money loses too much value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not good enough. While she's feeling the pressure, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. Let's close this deal and avoid losing more money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While I could push for a slightly better deal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes the most sense. The longer we wait, the less money we both get. An even split ensures we both walk away with something substantial."
