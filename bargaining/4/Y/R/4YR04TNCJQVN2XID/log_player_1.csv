Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, but I'm leaving Bob a small amount in hopes of securing an agreement early on. We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is a significant improvement from the previous round, especially considering the inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's better than risking nothing in further rounds."
