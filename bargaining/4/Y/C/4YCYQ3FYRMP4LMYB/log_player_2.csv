Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation has affected you more, but a 90/10 split in your favor is too steep.  Let's compromise with an 85/15 split.  I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000
