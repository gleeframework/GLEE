"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more to account for the risk I'm taking by proposing first. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with this offer. I believe we can get a more even split, especially since I'll be making the proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair starting point. We both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your previous offer, but I need a bit more to agree. This is a slight adjustment to make things more even. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is better than what we'd get if we keep rejecting and the money keeps losing value."
