"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message that tries to justify my slightly higher share as a fair proposal. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn! I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me this time. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less in this round, I'll have to take that into account when considering Bob's offer. Let's calculate the actual value of the money I'd receive:\n\n45 * 0.95 = 42.75\n\nSo, in this round, I'd effectively receive $42.75, which is less than the $60 I initially proposed for myself. Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see how the game unfolds!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll consider the inflation again and try to make a more appealing offer to Bob while still getting a good share for myself. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less in each round, I'll try to take advantage of that and offer him a slightly larger share than before, but still less than what I'd get.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Come on, let's meet in the middle here!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $43 and taking $57 for myself, with a message that tries to convey a sense of compromise and meeting in the middle. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the money I'd receive, taking into account the 14.26% decrease in value:\n\n50 * 0.8574 = 42.87\n\nSo, in this round, I'd effectively receive $42.87. Considering that Bob's money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I think I can try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see how the game unfolds!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the significant decrease in value for Bob's money and try to make an offer that's more favorable to me. Since Bob is under pressure due to the high inflation rate affecting his share, I'll propose a slightly more uneven split.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""You're losing value fast, let's settle this!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $38 and taking $62 for myself, with a message that highlights the urgency of the situation for Bob and tries to persuade him to accept this offer. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
