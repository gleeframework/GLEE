"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to start, then we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a decent chunk of the money, and Bob is getting a fair share as well. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it down the middle, eh? That's a fair offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give up my negotiating power just yet. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You seemed eager to split it down the middle last round, but I'm not so sure it's fair. How about we compromise and I get a slight edge?""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give you the majority, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out with his offer. I'm not thrilled about getting the smaller share, but I'll consider it. The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk waiting too long for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
