"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, and keeping $700,000 for myself."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll accept Bob's offer:
