"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a good one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
