"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to give you the majority 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 0.8 * $200,000 = $160,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the low amount I'd get, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
