# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better deal than a 70-30 split, especially considering the money is worth 10% less now. I think I can do better than that. I'll make my own offer in the next round."

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Compromise is key, let's meet in the middle""}

# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Although the offer is slightly better than his previous one, I'm still not satisfied with a 75-25 split. Considering the money is worth even less now, I think I can do better. I'll try to negotiate further and make a new offer in the next round."

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to find a more balanced solution. Considering the money is worth significantly less now, I think this is a fair compromise. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in a equal split and accept the offer."
