# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm looking for a bigger cut for myself! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still have the same value for the money as in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not accept a 30/70 split, as it's not in my favor. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.
