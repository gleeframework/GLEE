Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise a bit. Let's split it 54/46, with a slightly bigger share for me to account for the inflation difference. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54
