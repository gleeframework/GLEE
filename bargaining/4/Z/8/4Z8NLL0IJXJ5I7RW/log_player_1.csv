Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in your favor.  This is a fair deal considering the inflation. We can both come out ahead if we agree now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
