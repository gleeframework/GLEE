"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money fairly, or I'll make a better offer next round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob will accept the offer."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a big jump for me, I'll wait for a better offer next round""
}
```

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""This is my best offer so far, take it or leave it!""
}
```
