"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I'll take a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 5% less for Bob, I need to consider whether the increased amount he's proposing for himself is worth it.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 700,000 for himself, I'll try to counter that by offering a bit less for myself and a bit more for Bob, while still keeping a significant amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think you're taking a bit too much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a bit more for himself, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Considering the money is worth 14.26% less for Bob now, I think I can do a bit better than this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 600,000 for himself, I'll try to take a firmer stance and offer a bit less for myself, while still keeping a significant amount for myself.
