"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my $8,000 gain from the first round is now worth $7,200. And the $2,000 Bob was supposed to gain is still $2,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think carefully... I'd rather not take a smaller share, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the 10% inflation, my $7,200 gain from the previous round is now worth $6,480. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
