"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a split where I take $95 and Bob takes $5.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm the one who's taking the risk of proposing first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome considering the inflation and the fact that Bob could have proposed an even less favorable split."
