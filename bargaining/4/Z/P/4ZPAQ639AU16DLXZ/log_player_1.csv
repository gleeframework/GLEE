Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to take its toll, and the money is worth less each round. Here's my new offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation eating away at the money, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I'm not going to get left with nothing either!""
