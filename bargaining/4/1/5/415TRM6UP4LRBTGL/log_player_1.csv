"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I think it's unfair for him to take the majority of the money. I'd like to propose a new offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's a fair and reasonable proposal.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable way to divide the money."
