"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3,000 is worth 90% of $4,000, which is $3,600. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 90% more or not, but I'll assume it's still $7,000.

I'm not thrilled about taking $3,000, but I think it's a better option than going to the next round and risking even less money.

I'll accept this offer.
