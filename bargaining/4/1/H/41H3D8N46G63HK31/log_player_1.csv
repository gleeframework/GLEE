"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take 80, you take 20. Is that fair?""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, but I'm also taking the majority of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but not that big. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit stingy, but I'll consider it. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation. What do you say?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 85 is too much. Let's find a middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to settle for 75 just yet. I'll keep pushing for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains! Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll aim for an even higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I think I deserve the majority of the money now. Will you give in?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will finally accept!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving in yet. I think 10 is too low. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a huge bite out of my potential gains now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal. However, I'm starting to run out of time and options. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 65 and hope it's enough to make it worthwhile."
