"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer for Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  It's a 90/10 split in my favor, which is a good starting point considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. Even with the inflation, 300,000 is a much lower share than I was initially aiming for. I'll take my chances and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to offer a slightly lower amount to Bob this time, but still a significant share. This is to incentivize him to accept while remaining in a comfortable position myself, given the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still rejecting this offer. While inflation has taken its toll, I'm holding out for a better deal. I'm confident I can get a larger share with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer a bit less to Bob again, but still keeping it relatively fair. Given the inflation, this is a reasonable offer to both incentivize acceptance and still secure a good share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While inflation is making a significant impact, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I'm determined to secure a larger share, and I believe I can do so with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share this time, hoping to make it more appealing. Inflation is a factor, but I still want to ensure a decent share for myself.  I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm going to keep pushing for a reasonable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has taken a significant bite out of the money, and we're getting close to the end of the game. This is a 50/50 split, which is not ideal, but it's a fair offer considering the circumstances. I'll accept it and ensure that at least some money is secured."
