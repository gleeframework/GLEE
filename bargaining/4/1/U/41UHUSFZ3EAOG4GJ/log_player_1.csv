"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the offer now.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Bob's offer is 60/40, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting it now against the potential benefits of waiting for another round.

I'll reject the offer for now, hoping that I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob! I'll give you a bit less this time, but still a fair deal""
}
```"
