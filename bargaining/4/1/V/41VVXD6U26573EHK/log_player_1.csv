"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I would have preferred my slightly favorable split, Bob's offer is fair. Accepting now avoids the risk of further inflation diminishing our potential gains."
