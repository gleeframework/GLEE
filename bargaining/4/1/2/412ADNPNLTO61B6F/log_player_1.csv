"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
