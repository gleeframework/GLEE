"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll still give you a decent amount! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. But I don't want to risk waiting too long and losing out on a decent amount.
