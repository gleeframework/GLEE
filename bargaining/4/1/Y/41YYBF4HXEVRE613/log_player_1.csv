"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm starting with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather aim for a higher share. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round. Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll offer a slightly higher share for myself.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
