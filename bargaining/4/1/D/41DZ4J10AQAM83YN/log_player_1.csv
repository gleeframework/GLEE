"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the offer is still quite skewed towards Bob, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the current offer was 40/60, I'll try to adjust the ratio to get a better share. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}"
