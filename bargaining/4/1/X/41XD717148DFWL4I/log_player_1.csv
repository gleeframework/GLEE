"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight advantage for me, but still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With the offer, I'll be getting $4,000, which is a bit less than I would have liked.

However, I'll also consider the fact that Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, which might make his $6,000 gain less impressive than it seems.

After weighing the options, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit lopsided, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal in Round 3.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""A slight tilt towards me, but still a fair offer""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. This is a slightly more favorable offer for me, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to get closer to a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the offers, I'll have to adjust my thinking again. With the offer, I'll be getting $4,800, which is even less than I would have liked.

However, I'll also consider the fact that Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which makes his $5,200 gain relatively more impressive.

After re-evaluating the options, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
