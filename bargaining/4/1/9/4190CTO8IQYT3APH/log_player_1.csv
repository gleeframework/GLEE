"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor. Since Bob's money is worth less with each round, I'm hoping he'll accept this quickly and we can both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, this is a fair offer, and Bob's money is losing value quickly. Accepting will guarantee me a good portion of the money, which is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
