"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too greedy for my liking.  Let's be reasonable. I propose 70/30 in my favor.  The clock is ticking, and the value is decreasing with each round, especially for you. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
