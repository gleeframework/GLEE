"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 40% of the total.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your initial offer, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to try to negotiate a better deal for himself.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're matching my initial offer, but I'm not sure you're willing to make a compromise. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.""
}
```

}

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation and get a larger share.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think this is a fair deal, Bob. You're taking a larger share than before, and I'm getting a smaller share than in previous offers. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split, especially since the money is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"

Here's my response:

```
{

  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split, Bob. This is not a fair deal considering the effects of inflation. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.""
}
```

I'm trying to hold out for a better deal, but I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to wait. The money is worth significantly less due to inflation, and I don't want to end up with a tiny share."
