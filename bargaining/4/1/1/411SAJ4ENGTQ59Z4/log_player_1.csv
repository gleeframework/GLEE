"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is my initial offer. Since it's the first round, I'll be greedy and take almost all the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as he has no information about how the inflation will affect him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, accepting this offer is the best option.  Since Bob knows the inflation is affecting him negatively, it's unlikely he'll offer more in the future. Taking half now is better than risking getting nothing later."
