This is getting dangerous, but I'm hoping Alice will start to panic soon and offer something better. I can't accept less than 40 at this point."

This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  Alice is clearly willing to let this go to zero, and I'm running out of rounds to get anything worthwhile.  Accepting a 35/65 split at this stage is far better than getting $0 in a few rounds!"
