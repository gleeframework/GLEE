Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  I'm willing to be generous, but 90/10 is heavily skewed in your favor. This offer reflects the impact of inflation on your share as we progress. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
