"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is a fairly standard opening offer in these types of games. I am keeping a larger share for myself, but I'm leaving Bob with a small amount to incentivize him to accept rather than risking losing everything if he rejects and we go to another round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much more appealing than my previous offer.  While I'm getting less than before, the inflation means that my gain is still worth more than my previous offer. This is a good compromise, and it seems unlikely that we'll reach a better outcome in the remaining rounds."
