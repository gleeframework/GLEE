"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI won't accept such an unfair offer. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nAlso, please clarify how the 20% inflation works. Does it mean that the total amount of money decreases by 20% each round, or just the amount I would receive if I accept the offer?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a more reasonable offer this time.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Alice.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice.\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'd like to confirm that I understand the inflation mechanism correctly: if I were to accept an offer in the next round, the amount I receive would be 20% less than the original amount, but the amount Alice receives would remain the same. Is that correct?"
