  ""bob_gain"": 1000000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going to let you have it all, but only if you agree to take on all the risk of future inflation""
}
```

I'm essentially offering Bob the entire $1,000,000, but with a condition that he takes on all the risk of future inflation. This way, I'm essentially passing the buck to him, and if the value of the money drops further, he'll be the one to bear the loss."
