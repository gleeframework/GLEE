"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. The inflation is hurting you more than me. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Let's see if Bob gets more generous. His offer is heavily skewed in his favor, and I'm willing to bet he'll be more open to negotiation as the rounds progress."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm feeling the inflation burn here. This offer is still heavily in your favor.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before the inflation eats away at your share even more! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Bob is playing hardball, but I'm not giving in yet. His offer is improving, but it's still far too skewed in his favor. I'm willing to risk another round of inflation to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm making a serious offer here.  Let's be done with this. This is much fairer considering the inflation working against me.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it. The clock is ticking, and it's ticking against you. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

This is a tough decision, but time is running out. Bob seems firm in his position, and another rejection means risking even less in the next round. Accepting this offer secures me something, which is better than walking away with nothing if my next offer is rejected."
