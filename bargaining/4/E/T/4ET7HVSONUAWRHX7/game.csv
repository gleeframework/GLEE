9000.0,1000.0,I think it's fair to start with a 90/10 split.  Let's see if we can find a better solution that works for both of us.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  It accounts for the inflation while still leaving us both with a significant sum.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split is still too lopsided.  Let's meet in the middle at 65/35. This offer accounts for the inflation and gives us both a reasonable share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5500.0,4500.0,We need to reach an agreement soon. I'm proposing a 45/55 split as a compromise. This recognizes the time pressure and inflation while still offering us both a worthwhile amount.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
