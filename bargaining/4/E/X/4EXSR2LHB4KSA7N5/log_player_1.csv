"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money I gain is worth 20% less, so I'll need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject the offer for now, hoping to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my potential gains are worth 20% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, taking a slightly larger share of the pie."
