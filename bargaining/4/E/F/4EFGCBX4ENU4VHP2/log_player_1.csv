"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money is worth less in this round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
