"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's go with 55 for me, 45 for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for you! Let's speed things up. I'll take $65.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, 50-50. We're running out of time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob is finally being somewhat reasonable, and the impact of inflation is starting to get significant.  Accepting a 50/50 split at this point is a better outcome than risking getting nothing if we continue to haggle."
