"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice offers next. I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is fairer, as I'll be making the offer this round. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is the best I can offer considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better deal, especially since the inflation only affects Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make a profit. 65-35 is the best I can offer this round, considering the inflation is only hitting you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing me, 56-44 is the lowest I can go. Take it or we both get nothing 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is hitting Alice hard, and I'm worried we might get nothing if I reject again.  440,000 is a good gain, and it's better than nothing."
