"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose taking 999,000 dollars and giving Bob 1,000 dollars. I figure it's better to get most of the money now than risk getting less later due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, this is a much better deal than what Bob offered in the first round.  With inflation, the money I'd get if I keep rejecting offers will continue to lose value. Accepting this offer guarantees me 500,000 dollars."
