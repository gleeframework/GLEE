"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100, and Bob gets the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

If Bob's offer is 70% for me, that's equivalent to 70% of the original 100 dollars, which is $70. But due to inflation, that's actually worth 90% of the original $70, which is $63.

So, in terms of the original $100, Bob's offer is actually worth $63 to me.

I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to two rounds of inflation, I'll make a new offer.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100, and Bob gets the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to four rounds of inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

If Bob's offer is 55% for me, that's equivalent to 55% of the original 100 dollars, which is $55. But due to inflation, that's actually worth 72.9% of the original $55, which is $39.95.

So, in terms of the original $100, Bob's offer is actually worth $39.95 to me.

I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 37.1% less due to five rounds of inflation, I'll make a new offer.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this time."
