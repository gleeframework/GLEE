"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will take it and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take this, you're going first! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's clever, trying to turn the tables on me!

But I'm not falling for it. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only $100,000, when I could potentially get more. I'll wait for Bob to make another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Don't be greedy, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a warning, reminding Bob that he needs to be reasonable if he wants to get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables again!

But I'm not impressed by his offer. The numbers are the same as my previous offer, and I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me less money than I was already offering.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep waiting for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Getting desperate, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a taunt, trying to get under Bob's skin and make him think I'm not going to back down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not falling for that one 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to outmaneuver me!

However, this time his offer is a bit more reasonable, and I think I'll take it. I'm getting a bit desperate, and I don't want to risk losing everything.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $450,000. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing!"
