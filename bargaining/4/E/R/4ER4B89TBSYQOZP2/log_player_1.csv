"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. You can get a decent amount upfront.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Let's be a bit more realistic. This offer accounts for future value. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Let's break down why:

* **Inflation is key:** The value of the money decreases rapidly for Bob. This gives me leverage as the game progresses.
* **Bob's offer is still weak:** Even with inflation factored in, his offer isn't significantly better. It's likely he'll become much more agreeable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, this deal gets worse for you with every round. Let's be practical and end this here.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:** Bob's money is losing value fast. Highlighting this keeps the pressure on him.
* **Slight Concession:**  Offering 35 instead of 30 from Round 1 might seem counterintuitive, but it makes the offer appear more ""reasonable"" while still heavily favoring me. 
* **Aiming for Agreement:** While I have the advantage, dragging this out too long has risks. This offer aims to be tempting enough for Bob to accept now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're losing value fast. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While my position is technically stronger, the inflation means even a perfect outcome in later rounds won't be that much better than 50/50 now.
* **Bob's Desperation:** His message indicates he understands the situation's urgency. It's unlikely he'll offer anything significantly better in future rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's always a risk Bob might act irrationally, but a guaranteed 50% now is a solid outcome given the circumstances."
