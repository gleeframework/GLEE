"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a larger share to start strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the split is now 50-50, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to settle for an equal split just yet. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gains, I'll aim to negotiate a better deal. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still trying to secure a larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains. Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think carefully about it. Since the split is now 45-55 in Bob's favor, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a split that heavily favors Bob, especially with the inflation eating away at my potential gains. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is really starting to bite! With my potential gains worth 36.1% less than in the first round, I need to be cautious. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm now proposing a 50-50 split, trying to find common ground with Bob."
