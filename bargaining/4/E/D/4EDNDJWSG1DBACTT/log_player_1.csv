"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair split, in the hopes that he'll accept it and we can end the game here. Since the value of the money decreases by 20% for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to end the game as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split it evenly, but I'm willing to give you a slight advantage. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I'm trying to end the game as quickly as possible due to the inflation penalty, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer. While I'd love to get more money, the fact that the value of the money decreases by 20% for me in each subsequent round means that I might end up with less if I reject this offer and we go to another round. Given that Bob's offer still gives me a decent amount of $40, I'll accept this offer to minimize the impact of inflation.
###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nWait, I changed my mind! I can do better than that. Since I'm trying to maximize my gain, I should try to get more money. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.
