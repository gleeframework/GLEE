"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my strategy considering the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less each round, I'll aim to get a larger share now to compensate for the decrease in value.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share now to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial amount, which should give me a bigger buffer against the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me! Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth significantly less than before, I'll have to accept this offer to avoid losing even more value. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
