"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself, with the message that we can negotiate further from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful.

I'll reject this offer because I'm getting the same amount as Bob, but considering the inflation, I'd be getting less value out of my share compared to Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need something substantial for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is worth 25% of the original amount, and keeping $750,000, which is worth 75% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation.  Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll have to be strategic.

I'll accept this offer because, considering the inflation, I'm getting a better deal than I would have gotten in the first round, and it's a more substantial share than what I offered in the third round. Plus, it's a fair compromise that might lead to a better outcome for both of us.
