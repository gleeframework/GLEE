{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure why Bob thinks I can do better, but I'm not willing to give up 3,000 and end up with only 3,000. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one in the next round."

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the new offer, but I'm running out of options.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think I've been pushing too hard and Bob is trying to make a last-ditch effort to get a better deal. At this point, I'm willing to accept a smaller share to end the game and get some certainty. I'll take the 4,000 and call it a day."
