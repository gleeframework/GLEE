"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise on a 2:1 ratio, considering the value of money will decrease over time. This way, we can both benefit from the initial amount. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
