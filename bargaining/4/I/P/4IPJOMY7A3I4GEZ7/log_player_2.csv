I reject this offer. 100,000 is too low for me.  I want a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose an even split of the money. This is fair and ensures we both get a significant amount."
