"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too lopsided. Let's be reasonable. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
