,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,Your offer was a bit imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Let's compromise.  I'll take 70%, and you can have 30%. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more, but I don't think we can go much lower than this.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,This is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it.,Bob,4,
