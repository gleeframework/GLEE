"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""My turn. This offer benefits us both in the long run.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:**  The money decreases in value each round. It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting a worse deal later.
* **Exploiting Different Inflation Rates:** Alice's money is losing value slower than Bob's. This means she might be more willing to accept a slightly smaller share now to avoid further losses later. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  While this offer is tilted in Bob's favor, it's not drastically unfair. It gives Alice a chance to consider the long-term implications and potentially accept a reasonable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less money there is to be split. Accepting now might be better than risking a worse offer in round 4, where the value will decrease even further.
* **Alice's Position of Power:** Alice knows Bob is losing value faster.  Her offers are likely to get progressively worse for Bob.
* **Reasonable Compromise:** While not ideal, this offer is a compromise. It's slightly better than her initial offer and avoids the risk of getting a much lower amount later."
