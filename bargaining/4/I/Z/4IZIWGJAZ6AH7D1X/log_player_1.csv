Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:
