"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting $800,000 and Bob getting $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $240,000 in the first round. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $630,000 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
