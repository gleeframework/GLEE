Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm willing to be generous, but we need to agree soon. This is a small advantage for me, but it's better than both of us losing out. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000

It's risky to push further.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're over halfway through the rounds.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The money is rapidly losing value. Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal now is better than risking a worse outcome or getting nothing.
* **Uncertain Future:**  Alice seems set on getting a slight advantage. There's no guarantee she'll offer anything better, and the potential losses from continued rejection are getting bigger."
