"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but it's still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with Bob taking a larger share, but I also don't want to reject the offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll decide to accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
