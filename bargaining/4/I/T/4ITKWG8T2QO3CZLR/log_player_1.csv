Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this more fairly, Alice.  This gives us both a good amount, and it avoids any unnecessary risk of losing money in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
