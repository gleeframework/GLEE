"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money, Bob. Time is money, you know! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting me hard, Bob. Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the inflation is affecting the value of the money, I believe I can still get a better deal than this. I'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer, considering the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Alice seems to be feeling the pressure of inflation more than I am, so I'll try to use that to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take into account the significant impact of inflation on your end, but I still think I deserve a larger share considering the overall situation.""}"
