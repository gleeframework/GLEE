Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'm proposing that we split the money 60-40 in my favor."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to get a larger share of the money, considering the decreasing value of the dollars.

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
