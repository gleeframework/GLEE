Let's see if we can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. How about 52-48? 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a bit more, it's better to take what I can get before inflation eats away at my potential gains."
