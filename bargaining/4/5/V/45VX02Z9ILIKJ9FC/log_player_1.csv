"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. I propose we each take half of the money, as it's the most equitable option. We can then avoid further rounds and both benefit from the full value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
