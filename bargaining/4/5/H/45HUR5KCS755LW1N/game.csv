40.0,60.0,"Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about a 60/40 split?  It considers the time value of money with inflation impacting us both.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's be reasonable. We're both losing value with each round, so a 50/50 split seems like the fairest way to move forward.  Let's end this quickly and avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
