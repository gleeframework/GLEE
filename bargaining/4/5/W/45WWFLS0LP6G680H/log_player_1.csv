"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the money, and I'm giving Bob a slightly smaller share to encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This way, I'll get 30 dollars, which is a reasonable compromise, and we can end the game."
