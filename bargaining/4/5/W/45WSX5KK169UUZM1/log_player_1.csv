"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a decent amount to start, but I'm aiming for the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and Bob gets the remaining $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  A 55/45 split is a good starting point.  If you reject this, we'll be losing money quickly! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll consider the offer carefully.

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for a 55/45 split, but I think I can do better. I'll give you 40% and take 60%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  We're losing money with each round, so let's agree to a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, especially considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
