"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take the majority of the money, but I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $30 in this round is equivalent to $27 in the first round, which is a significant reduction. I'll think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This way, we'll split the remaining money equally, and I'll get a decent share considering the decreasing value of the money."
