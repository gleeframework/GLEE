"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly!""}\n\nI propose that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. This is a reasonable split, with me getting 60% and Bob getting 40%. The message ""Let's split fairly!"" conveys my intention to divide the money in a way that is mutually beneficial.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the proposal. If he rejects, I'll proceed to the next round."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for himself is not satisfactory, as I was initially aiming for a 60-40 split in my favor. I'll proceed to the next round to try and get a more favorable outcome.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of the next round. I'll make a new proposal to Bob."

This is a slight adjustment from my initial offer, taking into account the 20% decrease in value for me.

Although the money is worth 48.8% less to me in this round, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round.

# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 67.23% less to me in this round, I'm not ready to accept an offer that is this unfavorable. Bob's proposal of $4,200 for me and $5,800 for himself is heavily skewed in his favor, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round.

# Bob gain: 6200
