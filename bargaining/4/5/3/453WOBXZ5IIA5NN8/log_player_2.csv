Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While time pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean settling for less than what I aimed for in Round 4. Alice's losses are accelerating faster than mine. There's a chance she'll become more agreeable in the next round as the risk of getting nothing increases."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it - a final offer for a 50/50 split.  Let's end this before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The time pressure is significant now.  While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a strong negotiating point:

* **Fairness:** It's objectively fair, which can be persuasive under pressure.
* **Simplicity:**  Easy to understand and agree on quickly.
* **Prevents Loss:** Highlights the very real risk of both sides getting nothing.

Alice's losses are still greater than mine, so there's a chance she'll accept a less favorable deal now to avoid walking away empty-handed."
