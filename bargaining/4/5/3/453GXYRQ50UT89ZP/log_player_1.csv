"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40?""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering I'm the one who has to worry about inflation. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your cut decreases significantly with each round due to inflation. Let's be reasonable, 55-45? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept Bob's offer, even though he's trying to sound reasonable. Since I'm the one affected by inflation, I want to try to get a better deal before the money loses even more value. It's still early in the game, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to see if I can get a more favorable offer. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a slightly more conservative offer this time, considering the inflation. I'll offer Bob a bit more to try to entice him to accept, while still trying to get a decent share for myself.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or I'll be forced to be even less generous in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer, even though he's trying to sound stern. Since I'm the one affected by inflation, I want to try to get a better deal before the money loses even more value. However, I have to consider that the money is now worth almost 50% less than in the first round, so I need to be careful not to be too greedy.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make an even more conservative offer this time, considering the significant impact of inflation. I'll offer Bob a larger share to try to entice him to accept, while still trying to get a somewhat decent share for myself.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, and this is the most logical outcome. An even split is the fairest option. Let's close this deal and walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm going to accept Bob's offer this time. With the money being worth over 67% less than in the first round, an even split is actually a relatively good deal for me at this point. I've tried to negotiate for a better share, but Bob hasn't budged, and the inflation is really taking its toll. I think it's time to cut my losses and accept the offer.
