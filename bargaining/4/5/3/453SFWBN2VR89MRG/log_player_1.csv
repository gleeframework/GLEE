"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. This seems fair, wouldn't you agree? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not so generous of Bob, considering the first offer was already quite low!

I'll think carefully before responding. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd rather not split it down the middle, as it would leave me with less than I initially wanted.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and let him make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to bite! The money is worth 20% less than in the previous round.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not being very generous, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but still a significant amount considering the inflation. Let's see if he'll budge!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a middle ground. This offer is fairer to both of us, and we can avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round, and Bob's offer is... interesting.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm also not eager to wait for another round and lose even more value due to inflation. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

Let's wrap up the game and see how it all shakes out!"
