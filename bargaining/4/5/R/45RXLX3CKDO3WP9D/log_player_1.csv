"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money and Bob 10%. It's a fairly aggressive offer in the first round, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, rejecting it keeps me in the driver's seat.  The game is still early, and I can likely get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This offer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. It's still favorable to me, but it shows that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm also hoping the inflation will push Bob to accept a slightly lower share than he originally sought."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, rejecting it keeps me in the driver's seat. Inflation is hurting me, but I'm still better off taking the risk of getting a better offer later. I'm betting that Bob will get nervous as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split in this round.  Inflation is hitting me hard, and I need to secure a deal.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that a 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially given how inflation is impacting the value of the money for me."
