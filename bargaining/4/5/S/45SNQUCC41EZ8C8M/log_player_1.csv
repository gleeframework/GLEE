"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, fair and simple""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000, which is a generous 40% of the initial 10,000$. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share since I'm making the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to stick with the 60/40 split, but this time in his favor.

Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll get 4000, which is worth 95% of the original 4000, so I'll actually get 3800.

I'm not thrilled about it, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now and wait for the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in round 2, so the total amount is now worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of the original 10,000$. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55/45""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4500, which is a slightly more generous share, but still in my favor. Let's see if he'll accept this offer."
