"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take a closer look at Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be careful. With a 5% decrease in value, my gain of $4000 is actually worth 95% of the original amount, which is $3800. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 80% of the original amount, which is $4800.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable now. I'll decide to accept this offer.
