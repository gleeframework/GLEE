"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and we can reassess as we go.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but we can adjust as we go 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather take a larger share now to make up for it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and leaving room for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this round, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the impact of inflation, I think I should accept this offer. The money is worth less, and I'd rather get a larger share now than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $4,000 and hope that I can negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
