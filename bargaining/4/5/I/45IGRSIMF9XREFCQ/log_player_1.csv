"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but still a decent start 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll consider the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less.

I'll analyze the offer:

* I get $3,000, which is worth the same as in the first round.
* Bob gets $7,000, but it's worth 10% less than his original $7,000 in the first round.

Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me than it initially seems. I'll accept this offer.
