Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it closer to 70/30 this time, taking into account the inflation.  If you reject this, I'm not sure we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
