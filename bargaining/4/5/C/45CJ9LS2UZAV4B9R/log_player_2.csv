Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

This is getting too risky. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer guarantees a reasonable sum before inflation eats away too much more."
