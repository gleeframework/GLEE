"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a 60% share of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values.

I'll reject this offer because it's less favorable to me than my initial offer. I'll wait for the next round. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round of inflation, and another 20% less after the second round, the money is now worth 60% of its original value. I'll take this into account in my new offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me a 70% share of the current value of the money, leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values.

I'll reject this offer because it's less favorable to me than my initial offer from Round 1, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 60% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, and another 48.8% less after the fourth round, the money is now worth around 30.72% of its original value (60% * 0.488 = 0.2944, but since we are dealing with percentages, we multiply 60 by 0.488 and then multiply by 100 to get 30.72%).

I'll take this into account in my new offer. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a 66.67% share of the current value of the money, leaving Bob with 33.33%."
