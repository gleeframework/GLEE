Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 60/40 in my favor. This takes into account inflation and hopefully leads to a quicker resolution. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob. Waiting longer means a smaller share will be worth even less. 
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is unlikely to offer a deal where she receives significantly less than 60%. Her offer has already shifted from 90/10 to 60/40.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice's offer will improve in future rounds. It's possible she'll offer even less favorable terms, putting Bob in a worse position.

Accepting 40% now secures a reasonable sum, even with the impact of inflation. It's better to take a smaller piece of a shrinking pie than risk ending up with nothing."
