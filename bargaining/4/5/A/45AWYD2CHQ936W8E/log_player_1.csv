"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with my next offer since the money is worth less due to inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40% of its original value now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the current value of the money and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is continuing to lose value. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 51.2% of its original value now (100% - 48.8%), I can calculate the actual amounts as follows:

Alice gain: 450,000 / 0.512 = 879,615
Bob gain: 550,000 / 0.512 = 1,073,438

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting a smaller share than in my previous offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth 51.2% of its original value now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,

```

I'm proposing that I get 48% of the current value of the money and Bob gets 52%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is continuing to lose value rapidly. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 32.77% of its original value now (100% - 67.23%), I can calculate the actual amounts as follows:

Alice gain: 400,000 / 0.3277 = 1,224,245
Bob gain: 600,000 / 0.3277 = 1,831,955

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting a smaller share than in my previous offer.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly now. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20.97% of its original value now (100% - 79.03%), I can calculate the actual amounts as follows:

Alice gain: 300,000 / 0.2097 = 1,430,155
Bob gain: 700,000 / 0.2097 = 3,339,845

I'll reject this offer since I'm getting a very small share of the remaining money.
