"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering the inflation that will affect Alice more in the next rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out.  This is a compromise that still benefits you greatly considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
