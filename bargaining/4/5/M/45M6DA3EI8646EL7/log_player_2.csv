"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take most of the money, but I'll give you a small amount to get us started.  Think of it as a 'goodwill' gesture. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better deal. The current offer of $1000 seems too low, and I'm willing to risk a 5% decrease in value to potentially get a higher share. Let's see what I can propose in the next round!"
