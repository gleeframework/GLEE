"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a generous offer. Accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A more balanced offer. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bite out of my potential gains!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less now, I'm effectively getting $300,000 / 0.8 = $375,000 in today's value.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to make a new offer. Since my money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 240000,
  ""bob_gain"": 760000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more aggressive this time. Think carefully before accepting!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting aggressive, I'm getting cautious. Time to make a decision! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential gains! Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm effectively getting $150,000 / 0.5168 = $290,625 in today's value.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gains, I'll have to make another offer. Since my money is worth 48.8% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 120000,
