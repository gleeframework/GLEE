I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

That's a terrible deal!  Even with inflation, taking only $5 is a massive loss. I'll counter with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to try and find a middle ground. This offer is still more favorable to me, but it shows I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this deal."
