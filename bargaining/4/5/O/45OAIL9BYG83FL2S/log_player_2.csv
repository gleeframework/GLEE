Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but it's important to keep the impact of inflation in mind. This offer ensures a fairer outcome in the long run.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be higher. This is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer.  We need to find a compromise soon, and this split acknowledges both the inflation factor and the need for a somewhat equitable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time's running out, and I'm not getting any less patient. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While time is running out, Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of the potential gains. It's worth the risk to counter-propose one more time, even with the understanding that I might need to accept a less favorable outcome in the next round if she doesn't budge."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this needs to end now.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the time constraint and the impact inflation is having on my share. Let's be reasonable and end this.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I can tell. But I'm not backing down. This is my final serious offer. 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, but with only 5 rounds remaining and inflation eating away at my potential gains, I need to be realistic. Accepting this offer gives me something, whereas continuing to play risks getting nothing at all if Alice refuses to budge further. It's better to secure a smaller gain than gamble on a potentially worse outcome."
