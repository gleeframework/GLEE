# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to give up a little more to avoid further inflation, but I need a better deal than your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly desperate due to the inflation hitting his potential gains.  While his offer is closer to an even split, I can likely get a better deal by holding out a little longer."
