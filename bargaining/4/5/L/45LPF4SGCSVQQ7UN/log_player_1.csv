"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll take 50% and you can take 50% 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll wait for a new proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to maximize my gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better deal to account for the inflation. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bigger share considering the effort I put in. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money!

Given the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be careful with my decision. Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as I don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially getting a worse deal due to the accelerating inflation."
