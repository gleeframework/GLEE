"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a big swing in favor of Bob, and since I don't know how inflation is affecting him, I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer a bit to 8000/2000, but still trying to maintain a significant share.  I'm hoping this signals a willingness to compromise while also demonstrating that I'm aware of the increasing risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the deal is now more favorable to me than the previous round, it's still not acceptable. Bob's offer is too low, and I'm still hoping for a more equitable split. I will make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but still aiming for a larger share. This shows a willingness to compromise, but also highlights the increasing risk of inflation."

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation is becoming a serious concern. I need to be more aggressive to secure a reasonable share. I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still prioritizing a larger share.  The inflation is getting out of control, and I need to secure a decent amount before it's too late."
