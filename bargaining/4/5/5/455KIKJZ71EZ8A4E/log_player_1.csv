"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 990,000 for myself and give Bob 10,000. This seems like a fair starting point given the limited rounds.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take 500,000 now than risk getting nothing later."
