"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take $60 and Bob can have $40. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. The message is a casual way of framing the proposal, acknowledging that I'm taking a bit more but still being somewhat fair. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! Let's be reasonable, this offer leaves us both with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer of $45 for me and $55 for him. Considering the inflation doesn't affect me, I still have the same value for the money, and I initially offered him $40. I think I can negotiate for a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, considering the inflation is affecting the value of the money he receives. I'll propose $58 for myself and $42 for Bob, which is a bit closer to his previous offer but still favorable to me.\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable offer""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hurting us both. Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer of an even split, $50 for each of us. While Bob's message tries to frame the inflation as affecting both of us, it actually doesn't impact the value of the money I receive. Given that Bob is more affected by inflation with each passing round, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. So, I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, but still taking into account that the inflation affects the value of the money he receives, but not mine. I'll propose $57 for myself and $43 for Bob. The message will acknowledge Bob's previous offer but also point out the uneven impact of inflation.\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""I see you want to split evenly, but inflation hits you harder""}\n\n###"
