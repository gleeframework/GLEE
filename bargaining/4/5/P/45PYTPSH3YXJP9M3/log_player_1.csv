"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth 560,000 (700,000 * 0.8). Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a reasonable compromise, but I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my share would be worth 448,000 (560,000 * 0.8) if I accepted Bob's offer. Now, I'll make a new offer.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up! My share would be worth 560,000 * 0.512 = 286,720 if I accepted Bob's offer in round 2, and now it's worth 286,720 * 0.848 = 243,081.12. Considering the new offer, my share would be 400,000, which is a significant increase from what I'd get from the previous offer. I'll accept this one.
