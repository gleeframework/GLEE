"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable starting point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to be careful. Since Bob's offer is still a significant amount, I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 70/30 split, Bob. I'll try to come up with a better offer next round.""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect reducing the value of the money, I need to be strategic. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 70/30, I'll try to counter with a more balanced offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the reduced value of the money, I need to be even more careful with my decisions.
