"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 2000 is now worth 1600 in real terms. Bob's gain of 8000 is still 8000 in real terms, but I'm not sure if that's a fair split considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to protect my own interests""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, hoping to get a better deal before the next round of inflation hits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 48.8% inflation, my gain of 1000 is now worth only 520 in real terms. Considering the previous offers and the fact that the money is losing value rapidly, I'll have to think carefully about this one.

However, I'm not confident that I can do better, so I'll accept this offer.
