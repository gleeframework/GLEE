"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent chunk! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up so much, but I don't want to risk going into more rounds. I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
