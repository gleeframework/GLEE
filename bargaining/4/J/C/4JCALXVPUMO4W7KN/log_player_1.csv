"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a relatively fair split to start. Since the inflation is more impactful for me, I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share.  Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Although it's a small change from the first round, the inflation is already starting to have a significant impact on my earnings. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly.  Bob's rejection has shown me that he's willing to play a bit harder, so I'm adjusting my offer to reflect that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really taking a toll now. While I'd prefer a more even split, I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better offer with the remaining rounds. Accepting this offer secures some money for me before the inflation becomes even more dramatic."
