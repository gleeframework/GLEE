I'm going to be greedy and try to get the lion's share in the first round.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very greedy! I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but I still want a significant portion of the money.  I think this is a fair compromise after Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation is hitting him hard. I'm going to keep rejecting and see if I can get him to budge closer to my desired split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer a bit more, but I'm still holding out for a majority of the money. With each round, the value of the money is decreasing faster for Bob, so I need to be strategic.  Hopefully, he'll see the value in accepting this offer before things get worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4880 
# Bob gain: 5120 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting desperate!  I'm still going to reject this offer. I'm confident I can get a better deal with the next round, especially considering the inflation rate is hurting Bob more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly higher share this time, but still aiming for a majority. The inflation is really starting to take its toll on Bob, so I think he'll be more inclined to accept a deal closer to mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5904 
# Bob gain: 4096 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tricky one. Bob's offer is close to my ideal split, but I'm worried about what might happen in the next round with the inflation hitting him even harder. I think it's wiser to accept this offer and secure a decent amount of money rather than risk getting nothing at all."
