"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. This seems like a fair and reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it without further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is losing value, so I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the 30% gain for myself, but it's a slightly better deal than the 40% I proposed initially. However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 70% share. I think I can do better than that.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70/30, I'll try to counter with a 60/40 split, but with a slightly more persuasive message to try to sway Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a great deal, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's share is getting smaller and smaller, and I'm starting to get a better deal. I think I can do better than 25% for Bob.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 75% share. I think I can get a better deal than that.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 75/25, I'll try to counter with an even more favorable split for myself. I'll aim for 80/20.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk, but I think I deserve more. This is my final offer""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I'll give you most of it, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's share is getting extremely small, and I'm getting a huge chunk of the money. I'm starting to think that I should just take this offer and get as much as I can, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob only 10% of the initial $100. It's a very small amount, but it's still something.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not happy about it.
