"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair and reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, but let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750
* Bob gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750

I'll accept Bob's offer.
