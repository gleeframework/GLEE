"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the potential for inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather have a smaller share now than risk waiting and getting even less. I'll accept Bob's offer.
