"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering you $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain and Bob would gain are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250 (due to 20% inflation)
* Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.95 = 5263.16 (due to 5% inflation)

I'll accept this offer.
