"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, my friend!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars, and Bob will get 30 dollars. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a friendly note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a strong stance, let's see if you'll accept! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth even less.

I'm not impressed with Bob's aggressive offer. I'd rather not give up 80% of the remaining money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (since 20% less twice is 64% of the original). I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. It's now worth only 51.2% of what it was in the first round (since 48.8% less is 51.2% of the original).

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
