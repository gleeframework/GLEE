"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next.""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair split to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me a slight advantage to start, see if it makes a difference 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, I'll accept Bob's offer, since it's a better deal for me than my initial offer. I'll take the $4,000 and hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round.
