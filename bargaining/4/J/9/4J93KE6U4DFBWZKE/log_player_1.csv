Let's see if Bob will accept such a lopsided offer.  It seems like the best strategy to start with the largest possible offer, given the severe inflation on Bob's side.  It also sets a strong precedent."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, and I'm confident I can do better. The inflation is working against Bob, and I'm going to try to take advantage of that in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try to push for a larger share again, but taking into account Bob's rejection of my first offer. This offer is still very favorable for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting any money at all with the inflation hitting him so hard."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough for me, especially with the inflation hitting me so hard. I believe I can still get a better deal by taking advantage of Bob's desperate situation. I'm going to keep pushing for a larger share, but I'm starting to feel the pressure as we approach the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but just slightly. The inflation is starting to hurt, and I need to be mindful of that. However, I'm still confident that Bob will accept this offer as he is losing money rapidly due to inflation."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd consider acceptable, but the inflation is still biting into my potential gains. I'm going to try and push for a slightly larger share in the next round. The pressure is mounting, but I'm not giving up yet!"

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but only slightly. We are nearing the end of the game, and the inflation is starting to impact me significantly. However, I still believe Bob will accept this offer as he is losing a huge amount of money with each passing round. This seems like a good compromise for both of us, given the circumstances."

I'm accepting this offer. Although it's not ideal, the inflation is severely impacting my potential gains, and Bob's offer is finally approaching a reasonable compromise. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all.  The pressure of the deadline is making me realize I need to be more pragmatic."
