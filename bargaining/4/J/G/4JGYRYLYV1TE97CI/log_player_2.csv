"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair start. Let's see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than Bob's offer. This is a fair proposal that still allows for both of us to benefit, considering the diminishing value. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still heavily favoring herself, even with the faster devaluation she faces. While her willingness to compromise is a good sign, this offer isn't good enough yet. I need to push for a more equitable split in the next round, taking advantage of the increasing pressure from the declining value."
