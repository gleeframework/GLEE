"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'll give you 40% of the money, and I'll keep 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a larger share, but I'm not sure if I want to give him 60% of the money. I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'll give you 45% of the money, and I'll keep 55%."
