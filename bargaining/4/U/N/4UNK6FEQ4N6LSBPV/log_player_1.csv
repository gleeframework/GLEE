"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70, you get 30. Let's start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me getting the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a bit more to make up for it. However, meeting in the middle is a reasonable proposal, and it's a fair split.

I'll accept this offer.
