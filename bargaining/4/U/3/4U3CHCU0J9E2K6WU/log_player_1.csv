"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still worth the same, but Bob's gain being worth 10% less, this offer seems quite unfavorable to me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This is a 55-45 split, which I hope will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the gains, considering the inflation.

My gain of 550,000 in round 3 is still worth the same as in round 1, which is $550,000.

Bob's gain of 550,000 in round 4 is worth 72.9% of the original amount, which is $400,000 (550,000 * 0.729).

My gain of 450,000 in Bob's offer is worth the same as in round 1, which is $450,000.

Considering the actual values, this offer seems more favorable to me than my previous one, and it's closer to a 50-50 split.
