"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get a small share, but it's still better than nothing! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. While it's true that I'll get a small share, it's still a significant amount of money. On the other hand, Bob is offering a very lopsided deal, and I'm not sure I want to give up so much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite lopsided, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. I'll give him a slightly smaller share, but still a significant one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, considering the inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still holding out for a better deal, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another lopsided offer from Bob! He's not willing to compromise, it seems. I'll have to think carefully about this one. The money I'd get is still a significant amount, but it's less than what I'd like.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, since Bob is holding out for a better deal. I'll offer him a smaller share, but still a substantial one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a move, Bob! This is my best offer so far!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice! I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is even more lopsided than the previous ones! Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation. I'll have to think carefully about whether it's worth it to accept this offer.

However, considering the inflation, the money I'd get is actually not that bad. It's still a significant amount, and it's better than getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement.
