"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 is the most logical way to split the money, and it ensures we both get a decent amount.  This way, we can avoid losing too much value due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
