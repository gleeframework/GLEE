"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm sure Bob might have a different idea!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob getting a larger share, but it's a better offer than nothing. I'll accept his proposal.
