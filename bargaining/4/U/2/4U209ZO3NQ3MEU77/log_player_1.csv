"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer aims to secure a large portion of the money for Alice while still giving Bob something.  It's a risky move, but with inflation looming, it's better to try and get the most now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

It's tempting to accept, but the 20% inflation means that my $1000 would be worth only $800. I'm better off taking a chance and seeing what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share to 8000, but still offering Bob 2000.  This keeps the stakes high for him, but with the inflation, it's a significant reduction from his previous offer.  Hopefully, he'll see it's in his best interest to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money for me, this offer is the best I can get at this point. The next round will see another significant decrease in the value of my share, and it's not worth risking getting nothing at all."
