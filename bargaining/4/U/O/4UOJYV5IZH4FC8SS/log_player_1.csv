"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself, with the message that this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's see if you accept this one! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $60 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $54.

I'll think about it... 

I'll accept Bob's offer.
