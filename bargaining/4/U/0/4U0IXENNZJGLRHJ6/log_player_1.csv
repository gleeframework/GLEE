"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI made an offer to divide the money, where I, Alice, will receive $600,000 and Bob will receive $400,000. I also included a message to Bob, suggesting that this division is fair, but I'll take a bit more. Let's wait for Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Do you agree? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer. Given that the money I gain is already worth 10% less due to inflation, I believe accepting this offer would put me at a significant disadvantage. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more. Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nIn this round, I've made an offer where I, Alice, will receive $580,000 and Bob will receive $420,000. Given that the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I've adjusted my offer accordingly and proposed a division that I believe is more fair, while also considering the need to reach an agreement before further rounds reduce the value of my share even more. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that we meet in the middle, in an attempt to find a mutually acceptable division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, let's settle this. A slight advantage for me seems fair given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer again. Although the pressure to reach an agreement increases with each round, I believe accepting this offer would still be unfavorable for me. The inflation has already significantly reduced the value of my potential gain, and accepting this division would give Bob a notable advantage. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a balance that takes into account the impact of inflation on my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 560000, ""bob_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, let's be realistic about the split""}\n\nIn this round, I've proposed a division where I, Alice, will receive $560,000 and Bob will receive $440,000. Given that the money I gain is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round due to inflation, I've adjusted my offer to try to find a more realistic and fair split considering the current circumstances. My message to Bob emphasizes the impact of inflation and the need for a pragmatic approach to reach an agreement. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I decided to reject Bob's offer. Although a 50/50 split might seem fair under normal circumstances, the significant impact of inflation on my share means that I would actually be receiving substantially less value than Bob. Given that we are already halfway through the rounds, I feel that I need to push for a division that better accounts for the loss of value I'm experiencing due to inflation. I'll make another offer in the next round, hoping to find a compromise that recognizes this disparity.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 590000, ""bob_gain"": 410000, ""message"": ""Inflation is crippling my share, I need a better split to compensate""}\n\nIn this round, I've made an offer where I, Alice, will receive $590,000 and Bob will receive $410,000. Considering that the money I gain is now worth 40.95% less than in the first round due to inflation, I feel compelled to propose a division that compensates for this significant loss of value. My message to Bob highlights the severe impact of inflation on my share and the need for a more favorable split to reach an agreement. I'm hoping Bob will understand the urgency and be willing to find a middle ground. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you more than half considering the inflation.  Let's be done with this. 
# Alice gain: 530000 
# Bob gain: 470000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my share, with the money I gain now worth 52.17% less than in the first round, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. Although the division isn't ideal, the fact that Bob is offering me more than half, acknowledging the effect of inflation, is a concession that I believe is reasonable at this stage of the negotiations. Continuing to reject offers and allowing further rounds to pass would only exacerbate the loss of value I'm experiencing due to inflation. Therefore, accepting this offer seems to be the most pragmatic decision to secure a share of the money before its value diminishes further."
