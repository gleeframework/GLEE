"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer is a classic example of a ""take it or leave it"" scenario. Alice is taking almost everything, leaving Bob with a mere $1. 

It's risky, as Bob could reject it and have the chance to make a counter offer in the next round. However, the risk of Bob getting a better deal in the next round is high, as the value of the money will decrease significantly for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is a much fairer split and guarantees Alice a significant amount of money. While the value of the money will decrease for both players in future rounds, it's unlikely that Alice will be able to secure a better deal.  Accepting ensures a reasonable outcome and avoids the risk of getting a worse deal in the future."
