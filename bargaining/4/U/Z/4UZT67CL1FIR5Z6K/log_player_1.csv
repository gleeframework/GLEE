"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small share, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of my potential gain, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll reject it in the hopes of getting a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to account for the reduced value of the money. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a slightly higher share than in my previous offer, but still a relatively small share to account for the inflation."
