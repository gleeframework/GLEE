"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the 40% decrease in value of the money I can gain due to inflation (20% in round 2 and 20% in round 3), I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This way, I'm trying to maximize my share while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! Considering the significant decrease in value of the money I can gain, I'll think carefully about this offer. However, since Bob's offer is closer to my previous offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take this offer, hoping it's the best I can get under the current circumstances."
