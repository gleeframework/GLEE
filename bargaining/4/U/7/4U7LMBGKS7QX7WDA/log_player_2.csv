"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide it fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is not immediately unfair, but it favors Alice. Given the inflation rates, it's worth seeing if I can negotiate a better deal in later rounds, even if it means a slightly smaller share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm aiming for a slightly more balanced split. How about this?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is barely budging!  While this is closer to an even split, the inflation is working against me much faster. I need to push for a more significant change in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,

""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and the inflation is eating away at this deal. I need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  This is my final offer.""
