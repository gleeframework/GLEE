"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept such a low offer. There's a lot of money at stake, and we have 12 rounds to negotiate.  Let's see what Alice's counter-proposal is!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm proposing a more even split, with me taking a slight advantage to reflect the risk of the negotiations continuing.  This is a fair starting point, and I believe Alice will recognize the value of reaching an agreement sooner rather than later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too low. While the inflation has affected her, she still has a significant advantage. I'm confident I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 575000, ""alice_gain"": 425000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to reflect the value of time and the potential for inflation to continue.  I'm confident that this is a fair and reasonable proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 491500 
# Alice gain: 508500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, and with inflation impacting her gains significantly, accepting this offer seems like the best option.  There's a risk of continuing, but it's better to secure a good deal than gamble on a better outcome."
