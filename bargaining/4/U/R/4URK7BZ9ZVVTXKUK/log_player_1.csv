"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can reassess in the next round.""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

Round 2

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is still not 50/50, I'll try to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split. I'll make a new offer: 45/55""
