"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'm going for a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'm confident Bob will see the value in getting at least $1, rather than risking getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing if I reject and we go another round."
