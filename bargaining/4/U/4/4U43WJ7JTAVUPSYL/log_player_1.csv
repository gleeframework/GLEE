I propose taking 900,000 for myself, and giving 100,000 to Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation will affect Bob more than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I propose we split the money 550,000 for me and 450,000 for Bob. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's last offer was significantly lower than my initial offer."
