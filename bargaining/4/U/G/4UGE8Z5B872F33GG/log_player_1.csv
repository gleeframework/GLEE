"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, but I'll try to negotiate for more in the next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to an agreement. I'll offer a 50/50 split for now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll need to be more cautious. However, a 50/50 split is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
