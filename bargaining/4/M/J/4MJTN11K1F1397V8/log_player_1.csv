"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, let's see if you can do better 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, as I'm only getting 40% of the remaining $1,000,000. I think I can do better. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me, but still reasonable for Bob."
