Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit more, since inflation is hitting your side harder. Let's settle this. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to accept the offer and gain something than risk getting nothing in the next round.  The inflation is hitting Alice's gains harder and the next round will see a significant drop."
