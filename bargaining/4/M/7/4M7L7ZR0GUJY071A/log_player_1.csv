"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose an equal split of the money. This seems like the fairest way to start, considering the uncertainty of inflation and the limited number of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than nothing, I believe I can still get a better deal.  The inflation is hitting Bob harder, and I have time on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60% and giving Bob 40%.  The inflation is hurting him more, and I believe he will be more likely to accept this offer than my previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hitting me hard,  20% is too low. I believe I can still get a better deal.  Bob is being greedy, but I'm not giving in yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my share again to 70%, knowing the inflation is hitting Bob harder. He's likely to accept this offer as it's better than the previous one, and we're getting closer to the end of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

10% is simply not enough for me.  Bob is pushing his luck, but I'm not giving in. I'm going to try and hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm taking a bold step and increasing my share to 80%. The inflation is hurting Bob significantly, and I believe he's more likely to accept this than my previous offer. We're nearing the end, and this might be my last chance to get a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the severe inflation, 5% is not enough for me. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal.  Bob is taking advantage of the situation, but we have a few rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm pushing my luck to the limit.  Bob's been getting the short end of the stick due to the inflation, and this might be my last chance to get a significant share.  I'm offering him a measly 10%, hoping he'll accept out of desperation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a joke.  I refuse to accept 1% of the money.  Bob is being incredibly unreasonable. Even with the inflation, I can still try to get a better deal.  There are still two rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

This is my last chance.  I'm offering Bob a mere 5% in hopes that he'll accept something, anything, to avoid getting nothing.  The inflation is hurting him severely, and this might be his only chance to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I refuse to accept this offer.  Bob is being incredibly greedy and is clearly taking advantage of the situation. While I am hurting from the inflation, I would rather get nothing than accept such an unfair deal.  This game is a loss for both of us."
