"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a significant portion. It's a good starting point, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself in later rounds if Bob rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my previous offer. I am willing to negotiate, but not at this rate.  I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm willing to reduce my share slightly to incentivize Bob to accept. The inflation factor is starting to bite, and I need to make sure I get a good deal before it reduces my gains even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous offer after inflation. While I would ideally get more, the risk of further inflation and getting a worse deal in subsequent rounds makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
