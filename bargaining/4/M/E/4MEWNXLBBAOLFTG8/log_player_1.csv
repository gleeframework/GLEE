"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept a small amount in the first round to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 51 
# Bob gain: 49 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is significantly better than the potential of getting nothing in later rounds due to inflation."
