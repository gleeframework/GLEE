"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a 4:1 ratio. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair starting point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll re-evaluate Bob's offer:

Alice's gain: $6,000 (worth 95% of the original $8,000)
Bob's gain: $4,000 (worth 80% of the original $5,000)

I'll accept Bob's offer. I'd rather get $6,000 now than risk waiting for a better deal and facing more inflation.
