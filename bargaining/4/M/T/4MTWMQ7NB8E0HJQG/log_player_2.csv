Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn.  I'm feeling generous, so let's try $65 for me and $35 for you. This is better than what you'll get if you keep rejecting! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you're eating into our potential gains!  I'll take a little less, $60, and you get $40. Don't be greedy! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, but the deal is still not good for me. While she's losing value faster, I need to push for a more even split. The longer I wait, the more desperate she gets, and the better my bargaining position becomes."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. This offer is more than fair, and it ensures we both benefit. Let's be realistic and end this now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to push a little harder. Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the diminishing returns. By offering a slightly favorable split for Bob, it puts the pressure on Alice to accept before the value of her potential share shrinks further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, you're playing hardball. Let's split the difference from my last offer.  I get $55, you get $45.  Take it or leave it, because time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but it's time to be realistic. Alice has met my previous offer, and while it's not ideal, waiting any longer could result in an even worse outcome if she panics. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable, although not perfect, share before inflation eats away too much more."
