"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $100 evenly, so we both get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less in this round, my gain of $40 is actually worth 95% of $40, which is $38.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with the large disparity in the split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll reject the offer for now.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think 45 is a fair starting point. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to keep a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you 30 if you agree now. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, my gain of $30 is actually worth 85.74% of $30, which is approximately $25.72.

I'm not thrilled about the large disparity in the split, but I'm getting a bit desperate too. I'll accept Bob's offer to end the game.
