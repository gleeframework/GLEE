**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer of a 50/50 split is the best we're likely to get at this point.  Here's why:

* **Inflation is hurting Alice more:**  Her share is losing value far more rapidly than mine. This makes her more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on.
* **Rounds are running out:** With only 7 rounds left, the pressure is on to make a deal. If we keep rejecting offers, we risk ending up with nothing. 
* **50/50 is fair:**  While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is objectively fair. Accepting now guarantees me something rather than risking everything for a slightly larger share."
