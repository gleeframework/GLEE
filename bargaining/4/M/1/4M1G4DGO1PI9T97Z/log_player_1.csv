This offer is designed to be generous enough to incentivize Bob to accept, while still giving me a significant portion of the money.  Let's see what he decides!"

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

With inflation taking a heavy toll on both of us, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option at this point, ensuring that we both get something while minimizing further losses. Let's see if Bob is finally willing to compromise."
