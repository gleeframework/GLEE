"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. A fair deal for both of us in round 1. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money's value doesn't decrease for me, I have nothing to lose by waiting. Meanwhile, for Alice, the money's value decreases by 10% each round, so she has an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. Let's see what she offers next! \n\n###\n\nYour turn, please! What's Alice's next move? \n\n###\n\n(I hope the response format is correct!)"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nHere's my offer for round 2:\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the money's value decreases by 10% for you each round, I think 55/45 is a reasonable split.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but 55/45 is the best I can offer. It's fair considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency, but the money's value remains the same for me. I've already offered her a better deal in the previous round (55/45), and she rejected it. Now, she's offering me the same deal, but with the numbers flipped (45/55). I'm in no hurry, so I'll wait for the next round to see if Alice becomes more willing to compromise.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next! \n\n###\n\nYour turn! What's Alice's next move? \n\n###"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money. Let's be fair and split it 50/50. This ensures we both benefit rather than risk losing out completely. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Although I was trying to negotiate for a better deal, Alice's offer of 50/50 is reasonable, considering we're already in round 5. Since the money's value remains the same for me, I don't have anything to lose by accepting this offer. Additionally, Alice is right that we both benefit from this split, rather than risking further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome. It's time to settle and move on! \n\n###\n\nGame over, I presume?"
