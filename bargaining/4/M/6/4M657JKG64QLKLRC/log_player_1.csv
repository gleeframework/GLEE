"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,500 and take $5,500 for myself. The message ""Let's share fairly"" is to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, hoping he'll accept this slightly uneven split and end the game early, before inflation reduces the value of the money for me.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  I propose a fair 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I offered Bob a slightly uneven split in the first round and he rejected it, I'm not surprised he's offering a 50/50 split now. Considering the inflation, if I accept this offer, I'll get $5,000, but it's worth 10% less than in the first round, so it's effectively $4,500. Meanwhile, Bob gets the full $5,000 value. Given that I initially aimed for more and the effects of inflation, I'll reject this offer to try for a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nYour turn!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the inflation, I need to adjust my offer to ensure I get a fair share after the devaluation. Since Bob offered a 50/50 split last round, I'll try to find a middle ground that considers the loss of value for me but still appears reasonable to Bob. I'll offer Bob slightly more than last time to compensate for his patience but ensure I'm getting a bit more to offset the inflation.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\nYour turn!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: How about a slightly better deal for me this time? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increasing effects of inflation, the value of the money for me continues to decrease, now worth 27.1% less than in the first round. Bob's offer of $5,200 for me and $4,800 for him might seem more balanced than my previous offer, but considering the significant devaluation for me, accepting this would mean I effectively get less value than Bob, even though the nominal amount is higher for me. Given the circumstances, I'll reject this offer, hoping to find a better deal in the next round that compensates for the loss in value due to inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nYour turn!"

Round 5

I'll offer Bob a bit more than last time, while ensuring I get a slightly better deal to offset the inflation.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, let's settle""}\n\nYour turn!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking - I'll take a small advantage. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is mounting! With the inflation rate significantly impacting the value of the money for me, Bob's offer of $4,900 for me and $5,100 for him seems more balanced than before, but I need to consider the 40.95% devaluation for me. Accepting this offer would mean I effectively get less value than Bob, but I also risk losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. Given the circumstances, I'll reject this offer, hoping to find a better deal in the next round, but I'm aware that time is running out.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nYour turn!"

Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is extreme now! With the inflation rate devastating the value of the money for me, Bob's offer of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for him is a tough pill to swallow, but I have to consider the 52.17% devaluation for me. Accepting this offer would mean I effectively get significantly less value than Bob, but I also risk losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the 4 remaining rounds.
