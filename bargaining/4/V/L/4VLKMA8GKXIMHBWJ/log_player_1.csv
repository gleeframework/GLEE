"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount in this first round, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting and ending the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so the offer is:

```
# Alice gain: 4500 (90% of 5000)
# Bob gain: 4500 (90% of 5000)
```

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I think it's a good opportunity to get a decent amount of money. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
