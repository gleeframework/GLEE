"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, and adjust for inflation later.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm trying to start with a fair split, and then we can reassess as we go along."
