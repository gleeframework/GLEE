"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering Bob $500,000, which is half of the total amount. This way, we can both walk away with a nice chunk of money and avoid the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him, but I'm still willing to consider it. Since I'm not getting the better end of the deal, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was a bit skewed in his favor, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more balanced. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This way, I'm still getting a slightly larger share, but it's not as extreme as Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting more and more skewed in his favor! I'm not going to let him get away with that. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer that's more in my favor.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This way, I'm taking a bigger share of the pie, but it's still a significant amount for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is getting ridiculous! Bob is really trying to take advantage of me now. I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'll reject this offer and try to make a counteroffer that's more reasonable.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to give Bob too much more of the pie. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

This way, I'm taking a huge chunk of the money, but Bob is still getting something. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can finally settle this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is outrageous! Bob is trying to take 90% of the money and leave me with a mere 1%! I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'll reject this offer and try to make a last-ditch effort to salvage something.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's getting desperate now. I'll make a final offer that's as close to equal as possible. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 499500, ""bob_gain"": 500500}

This way, I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, but it's still a very small margin. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can finally settle this."
