Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that wasn't very reasonable.  I'm willing to be generous, but this has to be fair.  How about a 52.5/47.5 split? 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but we need to find a true middle ground. Let's split the difference - 51.25/48.75 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly aiming for a slow creep towards a more favorable split for himself.  While the difference seems small each round, the longer we wait, the more money we both lose to inflation.  I need to put pressure on him to accept a more even split."
