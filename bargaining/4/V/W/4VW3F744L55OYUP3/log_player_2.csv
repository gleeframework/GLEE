"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is very lopsided in Alice's favor, and since I'm Bob, I'm going to try and negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
