"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm making a compromise 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking to my previous offer.  It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need a bit more than 40 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, the rate of inflation is working significantly in Bob's favor. Accepting $45 now is better than nothing if the game goes to the final round, but there's still a chance to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Alice, the inflation is clearly working against you. I'm increasing my share, but this is still a reasonable offer considering the circumstances.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to push the advantage.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and Bob can afford to be a bit more aggressive with his offer.  This offer maintains a sense of fairness while capitalizing on the shifting power dynamic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm trying to meet you halfway, inflation is killing me 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure, and her offer reflects that. However, it's still not a great deal for Bob. While the gap is closing, there's a good chance Bob can secure an even better split as the inflation continues to work in his favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. I understand the inflation is hurting you, but this division reflects the reality of our situation. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the law. By Round 8, the inflation has significantly eaten into Alice's potential gains. Bob's offer is a strong power play, aiming to capitalize on Alice's increasingly desperate position.  The ""final offer"" statement adds pressure for Alice to accept before her share dwindles further."
