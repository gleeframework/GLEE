"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the relative gains. Bob's offer gives me $3,000, which is 30% of the new total value of the money. This is a relatively small share, but it's still a significant amount.

On the other hand, Bob's gain is $7,000, which is 70% of the new total value of the money. This is a much larger share.

After considering the relative gains, I decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me such a small share of the remaining money. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, but still a fair deal""}

I'm proposing to give Bob a slightly larger share this time, with me getting $4,000 and Bob getting $6,000. I'm hoping this revised offer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting desperate indeed!

Considering the massive drop in the value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'm forced to re-evaluate my priorities. Bob's offer is... brutal. I'd be getting only $1,000, which is a tiny fraction of the original $10,000.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round. Bob's offer is a lowball, but it's a guaranteed outcome. I decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the $1,000 and hope that I can do better in future rounds."
