"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think I can offer something that benefits us both. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  This accounts for the fact that future rounds are more costly for you due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
