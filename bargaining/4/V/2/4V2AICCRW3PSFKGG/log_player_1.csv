"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be friends""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the initial amount. This is a relatively generous offer, considering that Bob may lose a significant portion of the money if he chooses to proceed to the next round due to inflation. I also included a friendly message to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer because, although the split is more even, the amount I would receive ($400,000) is worth 20% less than in the first round due to inflation. This means that, in real terms, I would be getting significantly less than what I initially offered Bob. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I decided to offer Bob $450,000, which is closer to the middle ground. Considering the inflation, the total value of the money has decreased, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. My message suggests meeting in the middle, which is a common negotiation tactic to find a mutually acceptable solution."
