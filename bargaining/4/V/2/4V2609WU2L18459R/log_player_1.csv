"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the stakes. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject!"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, he's effectively offering me $5700 and himself $5700, since 6000 * 0.95 = 5700.

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 60:40 in my favor this time!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a more aggressive offer than before, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in meeting me halfway!"
