I propose taking $9,000 and leaving $1,000 for Bob. I want to secure a large portion of the money in the first round, before inflation starts to affect the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
