Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that Bob is losing money due to inflation. While her offer is getting closer to an even split, Bob should hold out a bit longer. The threat of getting nothing at the end might push Alice to be more generous in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alright Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and we both know it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split was a good try, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Time Pressure:** There are only 5 rounds left. Continuing to reject offers significantly increases the risk of walking away with nothing. 
* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game goes, the more Bob loses due to inflation.  Alice is aware of this and likely to push her advantage. 
* **Better Than Nothing:** 4100 USD is significantly better than 0 USD. 

It's highly unlikely Alice will offer anything better than this, especially as the clock ticks down."
