I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to accept a small amount to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is much better for him than mine was, but it's still not fair. I'm not going to accept it, and I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer to Alice, but it's still a significant amount.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that the longer we play, the less money we both get."
