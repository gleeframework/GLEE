Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Bob is taking a bigger share, the inflation makes it worth less to him than in the previous round.  Taking 70 now is better than potentially getting less in the next round."
