Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share, but still leaves something for Bob.  It's a gamble, but I want to see if he'll accept it quickly or if he'll try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer a larger share, inflation has drastically reduced the value of my potential gains. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best option to avoid further devaluation."
