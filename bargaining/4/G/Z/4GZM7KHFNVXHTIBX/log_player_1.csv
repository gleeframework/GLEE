Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to see if he's willing to accept it early on.  This way, I can potentially lock in a large portion of the money before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep a larger portion of the money, I'm concerned about inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least half of the initial value of the money, while continuing to negotiate risks losing much more in the coming rounds."
