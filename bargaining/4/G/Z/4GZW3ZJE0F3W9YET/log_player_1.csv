"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering to give myself 60% of the original $100 and Bob 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of 70 is actually 70 * 0.8 = 56 in terms of real value.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll accept it for now.
