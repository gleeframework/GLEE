"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I am the one making the first offer""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering 60% of the money to myself and 40% to Bob. I included a message to Bob suggesting that being the first to make an offer gives me a slight advantage, and thus I deserve a bit more than half of the money. However, I am being generous by not taking too much, hoping that Bob will accept my offer and we can conclude the game in the first round.\n\nNow it is your turn to respond as Bob. Please let me know whether you accept my offer or if you would like to proceed to the next round. If you choose to proceed, you will have to make a new offer, taking into account that the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you were hoping for a better deal, but I think this is fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer in Round 2 because, despite the effects of inflation, I believe the distribution of $4500 for me and $5500 for Bob is not favorable enough for me, especially considering I started by offering him 40% in the first round. The impact of inflation on my potential gain makes me more inclined to try and negotiate for a better share in the next round, hoping that Bob might be more willing to compromise as the game progresses and the value of the money continues to decrease for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split now.""}\n\nGiven the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I've adjusted my offer to give myself $5200 and Bob $4800. This adjustment reflects the urgency of reaching an agreement before the money loses even more value. My message to Bob highlights the consideration of inflation's impact, aiming to convey a sense of fairness and the need for a prompt decision. I'm hoping this revised offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering the losses we're both incurring with each passing round."
