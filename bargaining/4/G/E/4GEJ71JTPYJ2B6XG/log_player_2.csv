Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split now. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is barely acceptable. It's true that due to inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting another round will significantly decrease the overall payout for both of us.
