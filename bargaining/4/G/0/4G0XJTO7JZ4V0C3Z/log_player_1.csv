"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fair starting point, and I believe Bob will find it agreeable. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better for him than my initial offer, the decreasing value of the money makes it a good deal for me. Accepting ensures I get something, and the risk of a worse offer in future rounds isn't worth it."
