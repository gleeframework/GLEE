Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly aggressive approach, keeping 90% for myself, and leaving Bob with 10%.  Let's see how this plays out.  It's a risky move, but I'm hoping Bob will be tempted by the fact that he gets *something*."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, it's not worth risking getting nothing at all. 50% is a fair deal considering the inflation factor and the limited rounds."
