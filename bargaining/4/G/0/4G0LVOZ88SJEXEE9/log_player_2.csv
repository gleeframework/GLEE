"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice rejected my offer, I'll try to do better. Here's my new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}

This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Alice's offer is still a 55-45 split, but with less value for me due to inflation, I'll have to decide.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
