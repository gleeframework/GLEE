Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving away too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with the offer. I'm willing to compromise, but 300k isn't enough, even with the inflation. I think I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'll take a smaller portion this time, but it's still a good deal for both of us.""} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more this time, but I'm still trying to conserve my share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I'm getting significantly less than what I initially proposed, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, and I'm not sure I can secure a better deal in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least something, and it's better than getting nothing."
