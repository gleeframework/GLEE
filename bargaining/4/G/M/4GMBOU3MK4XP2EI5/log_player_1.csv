"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split, and I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52/48 is a more reasonable split. Let's meet in the middle!""}

I'm proposing a 52/48 split, which is closer to the 50/50 split I initially suggested, but with a slightly more favorable outcome for me due to the inflation."
