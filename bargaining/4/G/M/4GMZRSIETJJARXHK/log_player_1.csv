Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept. I'm aiming for a large share, but I'm leaving a bit for him to incentivize acceptance.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I was initially aiming for, but considering inflation, I am losing a significant amount each round. Accepting this offer means I'll still get a decent share, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
