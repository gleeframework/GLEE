"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure a good portion of the money right away. I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than what I could get in the next round due to inflation. Accepting this offer will ensure I still get a good amount of money, albeit slightly less than my initial proposal."
