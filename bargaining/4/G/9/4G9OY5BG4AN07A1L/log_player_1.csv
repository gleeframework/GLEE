"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","A slight increase in Bob's offer, but still not a 50/50 split.

I'll think about it for a moment...

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going all the way to 60/40!""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit more desperate!

Considering the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob now, I think I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to squeeze out a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

# Alice gain: 1000000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob has finally given up!

I'll accept this offer, but I have to admit, it's a bit surprising that Bob would offer me the entire $1,000,000.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $1,000,000 and consider myself the winner of this negotiation!"
