"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer.  I want to maximize my share, but I'm still leaving a little bit for Bob in case he's willing to play along. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer.  While I'd love to get more, it's better to accept a 50/50 split than risk getting nothing at all!"
