"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split things a bit more evenly. This offer is fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's try this again.  My offer is still generous to you considering the time pressure and inflation working against me.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out Alice, and inflation is eating away at your potential gains. I'm offering you a deal where we both benefit, but we need to act fast. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean Bob gets a significantly larger share. It's worth holding out a bit longer to see if I can negotiate a better deal, even with the inflation working against me."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a compromise.  We both need to make a move to avoid getting nothing. Time is ticking and the value is decreasing with each round.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm offering you a lifeline here. Take this deal and we both walk away with something substantial. If you reject it, the clock keeps ticking, and your potential gains shrink even further. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is getting tight, but Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation. I need to hold my ground a bit longer and hope he becomes more reasonable.  Accepting now would mean a much smaller gain for me compared to what Bob gets."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is the final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Let's be reasonable and walk away with something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Time is running out, and the value is rapidly decreasing. A 50/50 split, even with the inflation, is better than risking getting nothing at all. This puts pressure on Bob to accept a fair deal, otherwise, we both lose."
