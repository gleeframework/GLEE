"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the initial 100$""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. It's the most equitable outcome. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants a 50/50 split!

However, considering the inflation, the money is worth less than in the first round. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

For me, the effective gain would be 50 * 0.9 (10% less) = 45. For Bob, the effective gain would be 50 * 0.8 (20% less) = 40.

Considering this, I think I can do better than a 50/50 split. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to counter with a 55/45 split, I think I deserve a slightly higher share""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2. This means that the money is now worth 10% of 90% of the original amount, which is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 (or 81%) of the original value.

Since I want to make a fair offer, I'll aim for a 55/45 split, as I mentioned in my counteroffer in Round 2. Considering the inflation, I'll adjust the numbers accordingly.

For me, the effective gain would be 55 * 0.81 = 44.55. For Bob, the effective gain would be 45 * 0.81 = 36.45.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 44,
  ""bob_gain"": 56,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my counteroffer, 55/45 seems fair to me""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
