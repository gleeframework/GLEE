"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it 60-40 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
It's tempting to take $4,000 right away, but I can probably get a better deal as the game goes on.  Alice is valuing the money equally right now, but it's depreciating for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4445,
""alice_gain"": 5555,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but let's make it a bit more even this time.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value:** The money is depreciating for me each round, so I need to factor that into my offer.  
* **Early Advantage:**  While I'm willing to be a bit more generous early on to avoid a stalemate, Alice needs to understand I won't accept a deal heavily in her favor.
* **Psychology:** My offer is framed as ""generous"" even though it's a better split for me than her initial offer. This might make her more amenable to accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle and compromise a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer, but it's still not a good deal for me considering the time pressure and inflation.  She's banking on me getting desperate as the rounds progress. I need to show her I'm willing to hold out for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Time is ticking away. This is a fair offer that lets us both leave with a good amount.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  With each round, the deal is getting worse for me due to inflation. I need to emphasize the time pressure.
* **Compromise:**  I'm moving closer to a 50/50 split to show Alice I'm willing to compromise, but it's still slightly in my favor to account for the depreciation.
* **Framing:**  By calling it a ""fair offer,"" I'm hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and make her more likely to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I still think I should get the larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to a more even split, the rate of her concessions is too slow.  The value of the deal is diminishing rapidly for me each round. I need to signal that I'm willing to risk it all to get closer to a 50/50 split.  Holding out might push her to make a more significant move in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. This is practically a 50/50 split now with how quickly the value is dropping. Take the deal, or we both risk walking away with nothing!""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bold Move:** I'm flipping the script and aiming slightly above a 50/50 split, but framing it as almost even due to the depreciation. This puts pressure on Alice.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** It's a gamble, but by showing I'm willing to accept a smaller nominal share, I'm highlighting the risk she takes by continuing.
* **Ultimatum:** The tone is more urgent. I'm no longer just negotiating; I'm emphasizing the real possibility of both of us losing out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I still believe I should have a slightly larger share. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but the risk of walking away with nothing is too high now. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the value of the deal for me is significantly diminished with each passing round. 
* **Alice's Movement:** Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation and is moving closer to a true split, even if it's slightly in her favor. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds is outweighed by the increasing risk of getting nothing at all. It's better to secure something now."
