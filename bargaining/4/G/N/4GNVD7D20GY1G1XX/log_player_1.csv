"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. My initial offer was already a bit aggressive, and Bob's counteroffer is a good compromise. I'll accept this offer to get a decent amount of money before the value drops further.
