"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. Let's see if we can improve from here.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair starting point to see if Bob will accept or if we'll negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with 60-40, I'm offering a 55-45 split. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I need to take that into account.

Bob's offer is a 55-45 split, which is closer to my original 60-40 proposal. I'm not sure if I want to give up more than I originally proposed. However, I'm willing to meet Bob halfway.
