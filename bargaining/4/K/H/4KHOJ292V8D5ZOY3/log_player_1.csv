"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can do better in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation and hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, I'm taking a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'll receive are:

* My gain: 40 * 0.95 = 38
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54

Hmm, it looks like Bob is indeed taking a bigger share, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accept this offer. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a 55-45 split. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You took a bigger share last round, I'm trying to balance it out this time!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to balance it out, but I'm still not satisfied with my share! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is still trying to get a bigger share!

Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

* My gain: 45 * 0.855 (1 - 0.1446) = 38.47
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.7273 (1 - 0.2727) = 40.0

Hmm, it looks like Bob is still trying to take a bigger share, but I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll try to counter with a 50-50 split. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I think we can both be happy with this split!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this fair offer!"
