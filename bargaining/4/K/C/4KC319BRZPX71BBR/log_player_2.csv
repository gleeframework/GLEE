"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds. I need to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation favors me, but I'm willing to accept a 60/40 split if we settle now.""
}
``` 

This offer attempts to establish a stronger position for Bob while still offering Alice a reasonable sum considering the time pressure and her faster depreciation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation, this is a more than fair deal 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to use the inflation to her advantage, but her offer is still not favorable enough. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this soon.  65/35 is my final offer.""
}
``` 

This is a calculated risk.  It's a strong offer in my favor, but the finality of the message might push Alice to accept before the inflation eats further into her potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below this 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, as the pressure is mounting. However, Alice's offer is barely better than her initial offer after factoring in inflation. My position is stronger due to the faster devaluation of her potential gains. I need to hold firm and see if she'll budge further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 640000,
""alice_gain"": 360000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking. This is my last offer.""
}
``` 

I am slightly lowering my demand to show some flexibility, but maintaining a firm stance. The message is designed to instill a sense of urgency in Alice, hopefully pushing her to accept before she loses even more to inflation."
