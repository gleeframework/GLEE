"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems fair at first glance, the inflation rate works heavily in my favor. Alice is losing value much faster than I am. It's in my best interest to see what she offers in later rounds as her position will become increasingly desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. Time is on my side. This offer is more than generous considering the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm turning the tables and offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a strong counter-offer that highlights the time pressure on Alice.  She loses 20% value each round, so she's incentivized to accept a deal sooner rather than later.  My message is firm but not overly aggressive, aiming to nudge her towards a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go below this. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is feeling the pressure and has moved closer to a 50/50 split, but it's still not good enough.  While I'm experiencing inflation too, it's significantly less than hers. By round 3, she's lost a substantial chunk of value, making this a waiting game. I'll continue to apply pressure by rejecting this offer and see how desperate she gets in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. You're losing value fast. Take this offer before it's too late.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand to a 65/35 split.  This might seem aggressive, but it's important to capitalize on Alice's rapidly diminishing returns.  Each round she waits, the value of her potential share dwindles significantly.  My message reinforces the urgency of the situation, encouraging her to accept a deal while she still has a decent amount to gain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't give in to your low offers. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the heat, but she's still clinging to a slight advantage. However, her offer of 520,000 is now worth significantly less than my previous offer of 650,000 would have been in the previous round. Her ""compromise"" is an illusion. I need to hold firm and make it clear that the only acceptable deals heavily favor me.  The longer this goes on, the more desperate she'll become."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or I'll start aiming even lower. Don't say I didn't warn you.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The tide has turned.  I'm pushing my advantage further with a 70/30 split. This is a calculated risk, but with each passing round, the balance shifts further in my favor.  My message is intentionally more aggressive to emphasize the urgency. I'm no longer just highlighting the declining value, but introducing the threat of even less favorable offers in the future. This puts pressure on Alice to accept before her position deteriorates further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: 50/50, last chance for a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally cracking. While I'm confident I could push for more in the remaining rounds, there's a significant risk she'll hold out for too long, leading to a stalemate where we both get nothing.  

Accepting 50/50 now guarantees a substantial sum that, while affected by inflation, is still a considerable amount.  It's better to secure a win now than risk losing everything by getting greedy."
