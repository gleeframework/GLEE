I'm starting with a very large offer to myself, but giving Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept. I'm hoping he'll be happy to get something rather than nothing, and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While it's a significant improvement from the first round, I believe I can still get a better deal.  The game is still early and there's plenty of time for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering a significant amount to Bob, but still retaining the majority for myself.  Bob's offer in the previous round shows he's willing to negotiate, and I think this offer is fair considering the current state of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to be patient and see if he's willing to compromise more in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to see if I can find a middle ground.  Bob's offers are becoming more favorable to him, so I need to show that I'm willing to compromise while still securing a substantial portion of the money."
