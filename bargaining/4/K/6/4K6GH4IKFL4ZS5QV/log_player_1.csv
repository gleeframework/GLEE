"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm hoping this will set a good tone for the rest of the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to be more cautious. But I still think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the current $10,000, leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I think Bob's offer is a decent one. Splitting it evenly seems like a reasonable compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer and take $5000. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than nothing!"
