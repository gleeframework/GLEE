Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to ensure a decent share.  This is my final offer before the inflation makes things worse for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but her offers are getting worse for me with each round due to the inflation difference. Holding out longer is risky, but I need to show I'm serious about a more equitable split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Take it or leave it, but the deal is only getting worse for both of us.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice's offers demonstrate she's prioritizing her gain and using the inflation difference to her advantage.  A 50/50 split is fair and emphasizes the time pressure. By presenting it as a non-negotiable offer, I increase the chances of Alice accepting before the inflation eats away at the value, even for her."
