# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how the next round goes. I'll make a counteroffer next time."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me. Since the money is worth 10% less to me now, I'll take that into account.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing fast. I'll take a slight hit and offer you $38.  Take it before it shrinks further! 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not ready to accept this offer yet. The decrease in value affects me more, but I think I can still get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the decreasing value, I'll make an offer that still favors me slightly but takes into account the urgency due to inflation. Since the money is worth 19% less to me now, I need to adjust accordingly.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Given the rapid value decrease, especially for me, I think 52-48 is a reasonable compromise.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is now $63-$37.  You're losing more than me with every passing round.  Agree now or we both lose! 
# Bob gain: 37 
# Alice gain: 63 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite the significant decrease in value for me, Alice's offer doesn't compensate for the loss. Given the urgency, I'll try to propose a better split in the next round, hoping Alice will see the mutual benefit in ending this sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the substantial decrease in value for both of us, but more significantly for me, I need to adjust my offer to make it more appealing to Alice while still trying to maximize my gain. The money is now worth 34.39% less to me, so every dollar counts even more.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""We're both losing a lot due to inflation. A 50-50 split at this point seems the fairest, considering the significant decrease in value we're both facing.""}"
