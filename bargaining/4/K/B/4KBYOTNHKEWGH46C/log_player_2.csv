**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against her. While her offers seem to be getting ""better"", they are still heavily skewed in her favor when considering the actual value of the money. We need to push her closer to a more even split, even if it means risking a few more rounds."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd rather take a chance than accept an unfair deal 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is running out.  Alice is clearly willing to gamble. While this offer is still tilted in her favor, it's becoming less so with each round due to the inflation difference. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout, whereas continuing to push our luck could lead to us walking away with nothing."
