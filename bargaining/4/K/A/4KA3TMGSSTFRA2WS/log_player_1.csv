"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with this""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I was hoping to get a slightly better deal. I was thinking of getting at least 55 dollars, considering the initial offer I made was 60 dollars. Bob's proposal of 50 dollars each seems a bit too low for me. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. Although the split is closer to 50-50, I'm not willing to accept 45 dollars when I was hoping to get at least 50 dollars. I'll wait for the next round to make another proposal."
