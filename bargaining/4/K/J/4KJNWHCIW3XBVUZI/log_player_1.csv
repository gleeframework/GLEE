Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the offer is still biased towards me, I'll try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer.

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500

I'll accept this offer.
