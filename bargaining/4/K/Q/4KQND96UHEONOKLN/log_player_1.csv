"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I get a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. Since the money's value decreases by 20% for Bob each round, he might be inclined to accept a slightly less favorable split to avoid future losses. Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This is a good deal before inflation hits again! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although he's being somewhat generous, I believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially considering the inflation affects his gains more significantly. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Inflation is on my side, let's settle this before it's too late for you""}\n\n###\n\nI'll increase my offer slightly, taking into account the inflation pressure on Bob. He should be more inclined to accept this offer, as the value of his potential gains decreases with each passing round. Let's see if this offer is enough to convince him to settle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Let's end this now before inflation hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer again. Although he claims it's his final offer, I'm still in a stronger negotiating position due to the uneven effects of inflation. I believe I can push for an even better deal, as Bob's potential gains are dwindling rapidly. Let's see if he's willing to make another concession."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Last chance, inflation will leave you with nothing if you don't accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll increase my offer once more, emphasizing the urgency of the situation for Bob. With the inflation rate affecting his potential gains so severely, he should be desperate to accept a deal. This offer is still favorable to me, but it's better than nothing for Bob, considering the rapidly decreasing value of his potential gains. Let's see if he'll finally accept."
