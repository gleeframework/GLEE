Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, inflation will leave you with nothing if you don't accept 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While far from ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of Bob's potential earnings has been severely eroded by inflation (almost 60%). Waiting any longer will only worsen the situation. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Each refusal makes the potential gains for Bob significantly smaller. He is in a weak bargaining position.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly aware of the impact of inflation on Bob and is using it to her advantage.  She's unlikely to offer anything significantly better.

Taking $300,000 is a tough pill to swallow, but it's better than risking even less in further rounds."
