"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I know the money will be worth less next round, so I'll try to get the majority for myself.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred more money, I know that the money will continue to devalue in future rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least $20, while rejecting it risks me getting nothing."
