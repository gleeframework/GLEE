"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 1:3 split, which means I'll get $750,000 and he'll get $250,000. I'm giving him a chance to negotiate, but I'm starting with a strong offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $750,000 is now worth $600,000, and Bob's offer of $250,000 is now worth $200,000.

Considering the new numbers, I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
