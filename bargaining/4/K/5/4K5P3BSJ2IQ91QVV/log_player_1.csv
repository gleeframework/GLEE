Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems fairer to me, as we both lose value in each round. Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
