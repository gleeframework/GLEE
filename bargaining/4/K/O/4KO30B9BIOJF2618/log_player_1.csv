"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering we're starting with a large sum.""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, which seems reasonable given the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split would be 60/40 in my favor, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 60:40 split in Bob's favor, especially since I'm already losing value due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to find a more balanced solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, considering the potential for inflation and the initial amount."
