"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

This is a pretty standard opening offer.  I'm taking the lion's share, but leaving a small amount for Bob to make it seem like there's room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm getting a significant share, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round.  I'll see if Bob is willing to negotiate further later on, but for now, this seems like a good deal."
