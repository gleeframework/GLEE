"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small portion of the money to get the game started, and I'm keeping the majority of it for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 80, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting us.

I'll think carefully about this offer...

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20% share for myself. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

I'll think carefully about this offer...

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the inflation, 60 is a decent share for me, and I don't want to risk going to Round 5 with even less value. I'll take the deal."
