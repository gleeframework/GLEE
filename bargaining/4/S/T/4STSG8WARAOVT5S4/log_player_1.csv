"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 

I propose a 990,000/10,000 split.  Since I'm starting the game, I want to be sure to get the larger share. I'm also accounting for the inflation factor and offering a small amount to Bob to incentivize him to accept the deal rather than risk waiting for a potentially better offer in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Due to inflation, my share would be worth even less if I reject this and we proceed to another round.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
