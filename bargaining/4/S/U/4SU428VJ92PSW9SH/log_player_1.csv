"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you $200,000 and keep $800,000. It's a decent compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $190,000. Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $720,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm still not getting a very large share of the money, and I'm not sure if I should hold out for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, my gain of $190,000 is now worth 95% of its value, which is $180,500. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve the majority. $700,000 for me, $300,000 for you. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further. I'll give you $600,000 and take $400,000. It's a fair split, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $700,000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, which is $599,300 (not $600,000, but close enough). Bob's gain of $300,000 is worth 72.9% of its original value, which is $218,700.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'm still not getting a huge share of the money, but it's closer to what I wanted. I'll think about it...
