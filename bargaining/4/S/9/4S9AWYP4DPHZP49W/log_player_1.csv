"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and leaving $2,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm also trying to get the better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth $3,200 (80% of $4,000).

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm trying to get the game going. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
