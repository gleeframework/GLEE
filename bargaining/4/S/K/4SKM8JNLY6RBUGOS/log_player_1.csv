"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This offer gives me a larger share (60%) to account for the potential inflation that I know about. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though my potential gain is 20% less, this offer is still a decent split and the risk of getting nothing if we continue is high. I'll accept."
