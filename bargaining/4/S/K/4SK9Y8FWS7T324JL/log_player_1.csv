"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""A fair and reasonable split, considering I'm taking the risk of inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, $400,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more aggressive split, but still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this one...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 30% share I'm being offered. I was hoping for a better split, especially considering the inflation is affecting my gains more severely. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""A slightly more aggressive split from me, but still a reasonable compromise""}

I'm proposing a 45% share for myself and a 55% share for Bob. I'm trying to find a balance between my desire for a larger share and the need to compromise with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more aggressive split from me, trying to find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are taking a toll on my share!

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer this time, as the split is relatively close to what I was initially looking for. I'm not thrilled about the 40% share, but considering the inflation, it's a decent compromise. I'm hoping Bob will be satisfied with this agreement and we can wrap up the game."
