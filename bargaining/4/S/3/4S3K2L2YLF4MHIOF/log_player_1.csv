"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent share.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a larger share, but I need a bit more for myself to make it worth playing 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Considering the inflation, my gain of $70 is actually worth $56 (70% of the original $100, but with a 20% decrease due to inflation).

Bob's gain of $30 is actually worth $24 (30% of the original $100, but with a 20% decrease due to inflation).

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept this offer for now.
