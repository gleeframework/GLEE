"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive devaluation. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get a better deal.  Even though Alice claims this is ""fair"", I'm going to try to see if I can get more.  Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. This offer is a good starting point. Let's see if we can work together.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is money, Bob, and money is losing value.  This is a win-win considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to hurt.  Alice's offer is decent, and I don't want to risk getting less in the next round. Let's take the win!"
