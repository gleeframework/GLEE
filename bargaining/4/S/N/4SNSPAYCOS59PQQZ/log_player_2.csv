"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split fairly reflects our positions in the game. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Let's see how this plays out. While not ideal, it's better for me to see what I can get in later rounds, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this split accounts for the time value of money. Let's close this deal."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Accounting for Inflation:** I need to be aggressive to offset the 5% inflation working against me each round. A 50/50 split would be fair without inflation, but I need to push for more now.
* **Strong but Justifiable Offer:** 5250 is a strong starting point, giving me a slight advantage.  The message frames this as a logical compromise, appealing to Alice's desire to ""close the deal.""
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** While this is my ideal outcome, I'm prepared to potentially lower my ask in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this settled. I'm adjusting my offer slightly, but time is literally money for you. Let's agree now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to pressure me with the inflation, but her offer is getting worse!  I need to hold firm and demonstrate I'm willing to go further into the game. Accepting 4500 now would be significantly worse than potentially getting even 5000 in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This back and forth helps neither of us. I'm offering a fair 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** By round 4, the inflation is eating significantly into potential gains.  I need to make it clear to Alice that delaying is hurting both of us.
* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm dropping my ask to the original 50/50 split.  This shows flexibility and might seem like a win to Alice, making her more likely to accept.
* **Firm Language:**  ""Take it or leave it"" signals I'm serious and unlikely to concede further. This adds pressure without being overly aggressive. 

It's a gamble, but at this point, getting bogged down in endless negotiation could cost me more than accepting an even split."
