"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering to give Bob $30, and I'll take the remaining $70. This is a fair starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants a 50/50 split, eh? That's a good offer, and it's a fair one. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
