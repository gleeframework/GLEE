"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the first to make a proposal. This should be attractive enough for Bob to accept in the first round, as he's getting something and the inflation hasn't yet taken a big bite out of his potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and although I'm not losing anything in value this round, it's clear he's trying to push for a more favorable split. I'll reject his offer and counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to try and get an agreement, but still offering a more favorable split than Bob's previous proposal. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, while still maintaining a decent advantage given the upcoming rounds of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and while I'm not losing anything in value yet, I need to push for a better split. I'll reject this offer and counter again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm further reducing my share to try and incentivize Bob to accept.  This is still a very favorable split for me, considering the inflation he's facing. It's crucial to get an agreement now before the inflation becomes too significant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a bigger share, Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial proposal.  With the inflation hitting his gains harder, accepting this 50/50 split is a good outcome for me. Further negotiation could lead to more rounds and further decrease Bob's gains, but the risk of him rejecting and ultimately getting nothing is too high. I'll take the 500,000 and end the game."
