"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. It's a relatively fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's a good starting point and accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth less than my initial offer of $600,000. However, Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth even less than my initial offer of $400,000.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to do better in the next round.

Round 3

{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. With the current offer, I'd be getting $500,000, which is worth significantly less than my initial offer of $600,000. However, the fact that Bob is offering an equal split is a good sign.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer and split the money 50/50 or try to negotiate for a better deal.
