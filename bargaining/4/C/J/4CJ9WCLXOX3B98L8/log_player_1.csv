I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 850,000 and offering Bob 150,000.  This is still a significant amount for him, considering the inflation, and it gives us a chance to reach an agreement."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable due to the high inflation rate he's facing.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share again to 800,000, offering Bob 200,000.  This is a sizable increase for him compared to his last offer, and it's a good opportunity to reach an agreement before the inflation eats away at our potential gains even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 625000 
# Bob gain: 375000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation is eating away at his potential gains more quickly than mine. I need to see a significant improvement in his offer before I accept."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm reducing my share to 750,000 and offering Bob 250,000. We are running out of time, and the inflation is becoming a significant issue.  I'm hoping this offer will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With the inflation rate so high, especially for Bob, I can't afford to be greedy anymore. This offer is a significant increase for him, and accepting it is the best way to ensure we both get something."
