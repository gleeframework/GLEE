"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of the money I gain, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively fair one, and I don't want to risk going to another round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
