"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and will allow us to avoid significant losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a good starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your initial offer, but I believe this split is more fair.  It reflects the fact that we both lose value from the inflation, but I'm willing to give you a decent amount to reach an agreement quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we're both losing money.  My offer is still generous considering the inflation rate. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like a larger share, I'm worried about continuing to lose money due to inflation. This offer is still better than what I would have gotten in Round 1, after accounting for the inflation.  It's time to secure something rather than risk getting nothing."
