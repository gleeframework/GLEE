**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but we're not at the breaking point yet.  While her gains are diminishing, there's still a decent chance she'll offer a larger share to me (Bob) in the next couple of rounds to avoid getting nothing."

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and we need to apply some pressure. Offering a slight increase for me while still giving Alice a reasonable share might be enough to get her to agree.  This emphasizes the need for a decision now."
