Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the inflation is working against you. This offer is a good balance to account for that while ensuring we both benefit. Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently offering slightly more than a 50/50 split, but he knows the pressure is on me due to inflation. While his offer is tempting, I need to hold out for a better deal to compensate for the decreasing value of the money. I'm aiming for at least a 55/45 split in my favor."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair deal that considers the inflation you're facing. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The game is reaching a critical point. Bob is clearly unwilling to deviate much from a near 50/50 split. While his offer is lower than I'd like, rejecting it means risking getting an even worse deal in the remaining rounds as the pressure intensifies, and the value of the money for me dwindles significantly. It's better to accept a less-than-ideal offer than to risk getting nothing at all."
