"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm trying to get a good chunk of the money to start with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! 

I don't like this offer. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is making things tighter. I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm trying to account for the inflation."
