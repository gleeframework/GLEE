Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking $9,000 and giving Bob $1,000.  Let's see if he's happy with that!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
It's better to take the $5,000 now, since the inflation will significantly decrease the value of any money I get in future rounds."
