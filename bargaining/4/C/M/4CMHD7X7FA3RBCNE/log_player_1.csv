Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the money will decrease in the next round. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
