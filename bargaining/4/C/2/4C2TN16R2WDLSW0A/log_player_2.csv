"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can work out a more equitable split later if you want to keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a risky move, but starting fair doesn't mean accepting such an unequal split. There's a lot of time left to negotiate, and I can try to get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced approach. I propose we split it 45/55, with you getting the slightly larger share this time. This way, we can both get a good amount, and hopefully, we can continue to negotiate a fairer split in the future.""}
