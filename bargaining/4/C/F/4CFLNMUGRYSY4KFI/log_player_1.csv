"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in value, and I think I can do better. Meeting in the middle at 50/50 is a good starting point, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm still worth more""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and Bob gets 45%, which is $45. I'm trying to give Bob a slightly better deal than the previous round, but still trying to get a better share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm still worth more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Oh no, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With the money being worth 48.8% less than the first round, I'm really struggling to make ends meet. Bob's offer of 45% for me and 55% for him is actually a decent deal in this situation. I'll accept this offer and hope that the next time we play, the inflation will be less severe."
