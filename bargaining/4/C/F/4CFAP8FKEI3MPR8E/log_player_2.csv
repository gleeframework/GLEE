Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my previous offers. Now it's getting really bad for you. This is my most generous offer yet, considering the circumstances 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
At this point, Bob's share has been drastically reduced by inflation. While he likely wants more, accepting Alice's offer is the best he can do given the circumstances.  It's better to take a smaller share than risk getting nothing at all."
