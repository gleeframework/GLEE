"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money equally. It's fair and efficient. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to accept an equal split, but there's a lot of time left in the game, and I know about the inflation. By rejecting, I can make a proposal in the next round that benefits me more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need a bit more to make it worthwhile for me. This offer is still better than waiting for the next round where inflation will hit.""}
