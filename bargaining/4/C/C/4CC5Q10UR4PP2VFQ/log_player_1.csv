"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is good for both of us.""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair offer to see how Bob reacts to the pressure.  It favors me, but not outrageously so. This way, he can see there's potential for agreement while understanding the clock is ticking, and his position worsens faster."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share Alice, but my offer is more fair. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to fair, but the inflation is working heavily in my favor now.  There's no need to settle quickly when time is on my side.  I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 75,
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Time is money, Bob. Every round you wait costs you more than it costs me. Take the deal!""
}
```

I'm increasing my demand to put more pressure on Bob. He needs to understand that delaying is hurting him significantly more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair offer considering the time pressure.  I'm willing to negotiate, but let's avoid letting this money disappear. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While still slightly in Bob's favor considering the inflation, accepting this offer is the safest play now.  The difference between his offer and my goal is getting small enough that it's not worth the risk of him drastically lowballing me in a later round out of desperation."
