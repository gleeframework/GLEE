Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer. Now I'm being generous. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. While my potential gains are diminishing, I need to hold my ground and make it clear I won't accept a bad deal.  It's risky, but I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice.  Let's be adults and stop this. I'm willing to compromise slightly.  This is my final offer.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much. You're running out of time. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough spot. I'm getting dangerously close to the point where further inflation makes even a highly skewed deal in my favor worse than accepting Alice's offer. It's clear she's willing to play the long game, and I need to cut my losses."
