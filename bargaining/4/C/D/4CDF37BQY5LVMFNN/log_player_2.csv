"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, considering I'm the one making the offer. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more since I'm making the offer this round.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself while still being somewhat reasonable. This way, I'm hoping Alice will accept the offer before the value of the money decreases further. Let's see what Alice thinks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference from the last round. This is a fair compromise, and we can end the game here. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the decreasing value of money, I believe I can still negotiate for a better split. Since Alice is trying to split the difference, I think there's room for further negotiation. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the decreasing value of money, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more than half.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the decreasing value of money, I'm trying to find a middle ground that Alice might accept. Since she proposed a 40-60 split in her favor last round, I'm hoping a 55-45 split in my favor might seem more reasonable, considering the effects of inflation. Let's see how Alice responds!"
