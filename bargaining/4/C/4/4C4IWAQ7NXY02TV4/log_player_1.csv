"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $50 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $47.50.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. A 50/50 split is a fair one, but I was hoping to get a slightly better deal. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing further inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
