"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take a small share for now, and we can negotiate more in the later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I need a larger share to account for the decreasing value. This offer is fair.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the value is changing, but we need to find a balance. This offer is a compromise, let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is acknowledging the changing value, her offer still heavily favors her.  It's better to hold out and propose a more balanced deal, even with the inflation working against me. Accepting now would mean losing out significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about needing a larger share to compensate for the inflation. This offer is my final compromise.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. We both need to make concessions to reach a fair compromise. Let's not let this go any further. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is eating away at my potential gains significantly. While not ideal, Alice's offer is now approaching a more reasonable split. If I reject this, there's a high chance the offers will get worse, and the shrinking pot will leave me with even less in the end. It's time to cut my losses and secure a decent amount."
