"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob with each passing round, I'm starting with a slightly higher offer for myself to account for the potential future loss in value for Bob if he decides to reject the offer and proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation affecting the value of the money for Bob, the proposed split of 55/45 in his favor doesn't seem advantageous enough for me, especially considering the original amount and the fact that the value of the money remains constant for me. I believe I can negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for myself, 58-42, while still considering the impact of inflation on Bob's share. Since Bob's money loses value with each round and he's under pressure to close the deal before it devalues further, I'm positioning this offer as a good deal for him, hoping he'll accept before the value of his potential gain decreases even more."
