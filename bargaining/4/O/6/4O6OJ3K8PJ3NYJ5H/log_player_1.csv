"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40, and we can adjust from there.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent chunk of money, and I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I want to keep some for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 30% share. I think I can do better than that. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a counteroffer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 80-20 is a more reasonable split. You can try to do better, but I'm not going down to 30!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will take this offer or try to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 80-20 is too extreme. Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my share!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 25% share, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another counteroffer!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm still not satisfied with the 25% share. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but 85-15 is my bottom line. Take it or leave it!""
}
