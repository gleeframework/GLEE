I'm offering Bob a small share to start, knowing he loses money more quickly. I'll try to stay ahead of that curve!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy, and his offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a drastic shift in our positions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, but still keeping the majority for myself.  With inflation hitting him harder, hopefully this will be enough to make him accept, as I'm losing less with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very low, and with inflation hurting him more than me, I can hold out for a better deal. I'm not willing to give up almost all the money just because he's losing more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to increase my offer to Bob, but still trying to maintain a significant share for myself. The inflation is starting to hit both of us, so I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hitting Bob harder, I'm not giving up 70% of the money.  His offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need a significantly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Bob a larger share, hoping to entice him to accept.  While inflation is hurting both of us, I'm still losing less than him.  It's getting risky, but I need to find a deal before things get too desperate."
