"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split, Bob. A fair 60/40 seems reasonable for a quick agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, given the inflation rate.  Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your offer doesn't reflect the fact that I lose more value each round. I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is more in line with the actual stakes. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it. The inflation is starting to get to me, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
