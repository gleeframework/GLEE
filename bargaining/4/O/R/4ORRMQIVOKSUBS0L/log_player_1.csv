I propose to take 900,000 dollars, and Bob gets 100,000 dollars. This is a good starting point, as it's fair considering the future inflation."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I propose a 50/50 split. Considering the significant inflation, this seems like the fairest way to divide the money at this point."

While I'd prefer more, given the inflation and the limited rounds remaining, this seems like a good deal.  I'll accept Bob's offer."
