"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of $6,000, which is $5,400.

I'll consider Bob's offer. A 50/50 split seems reasonable, but I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With another 10% inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of $5,400, which is $4,374.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a good chunk, but I need more for myself""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 27.1% inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of $6,000, which is $4,374.

I'll consider Bob's offer. $4,374 is my current value, and Bob is offering me $5,500, which is a significant increase. I think I can do better than this, but it's a good offer. I'll accept this offer.
