"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 6,000 and Bob gets 4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 60-40 split in my favor, as you proposed, but with the roles reversed.  Let's be fair, but also be strategic! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a bigger share, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to make a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
