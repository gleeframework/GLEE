This is a tough one, but I have to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation is killing me:**  The longer this goes on, the less my share is worth. 
* **Alice is unlikely to budge much:** She's been consistently aiming for a larger share and doesn't seem phased by my offers. 
* **Something is better than nothing:** If I reject this, there's a good chance we'll reach a round where even less is offered to me, or we run out of rounds entirely. 

It's not ideal, but accepting now cuts my losses and avoids the risk of getting even less later."
