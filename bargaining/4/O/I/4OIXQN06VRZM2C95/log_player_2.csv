I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair, the game warns about inflation, and I want to see if I can get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need more to account for the upcoming inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think I deserve a bit more given the current economic situation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, I am worried about further inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's still a significant amount."
