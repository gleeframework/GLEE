"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fairly generous offer, but I want to secure a good portion of the money early on before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
This is a fair split and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer.  I'd rather take half the money now than risk losing more to inflation."
