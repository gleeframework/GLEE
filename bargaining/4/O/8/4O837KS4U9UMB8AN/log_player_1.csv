"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm being generous! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and 40% less than in the first round, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob! I'll take 40%!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more skewed in my favor, but I'm hoping Bob will still accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take what's left! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer... Considering the significant reduction in value, I'll accept this offer.
