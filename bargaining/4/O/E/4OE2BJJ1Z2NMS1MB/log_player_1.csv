"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I'm starting with a generous offer, aiming to secure the deal quickly before inflation kicks in too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it seems like a fair split on the surface, considering the inflation, I'm getting 4500 (90% of 5000) and Bob is getting 4750 (95% of 5000). I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still offering a significant portion to Bob.  Since I'm losing 10% of my money each round, I need to start securing a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  The inflation is hitting hard, and while I'm getting 27.1% less than my initial 9000, Bob is only getting 14.26% less than his initial 1000.  It's still too early to settle for such a low share, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm raising my share again, but still offering a reasonable amount to Bob. We are getting closer to the middle ground.  The inflation is affecting us both, but I believe a deal can be reached before it becomes too detrimental."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While inflation is taking a toll, Bob's offer is increasingly unfair. I'm losing over 40% of my initial share while he is only losing a little over 22%.  I still believe I can get a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

With inflation accelerating, I'm raising my share again, but still offering Bob a chance to get a portion.  He's losing less than me, and this offer is a better compromise than his previous proposal. We need to reach a deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is unacceptable. I'm losing over 52% of my initial share while Bob is only losing just over 30%. We're very close to the end of the game, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

We're down to the wire, and inflation is hitting both of us hard.  However, I'm reverting to my initial offer. With only a few rounds left, I believe Bob will recognize that taking even a small share is better than getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still too low. Even though we're in the final stages of the game, I'm losing over 60% of my initial share. This offer is not a fair compromise considering the impact of inflation on both of us. I'm hoping Bob will make a more reasonable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

We're nearing the end, and the stakes are higher than ever.  This is my final offer, and I'm sticking to it. Inflation has hit us both hard, but I'm willing to concede some of my gain to reach a deal.  I believe Bob will realize that getting 1000 is better than getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 9999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is completely unacceptable. While I understand inflation has heavily impacted us both, Bob's offer is incredibly unfair and exploitative. Getting only $1 while Bob takes nearly everything is not a reasonable outcome. We both lose everything if we don't agree, but I'm not willing to be taken advantage of in such a way.  Even with the losses from inflation, my principle stands. It's better to get nothing than to accept such an unequal deal."
