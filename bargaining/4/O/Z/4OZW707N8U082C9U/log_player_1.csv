"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can split the money evenly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for Bob, he's trying to take advantage of the situation. I'll think carefully...

I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself this time. I'll propose a 55-45 split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the increasing inflation to get a larger share of the money. However, I'll notice that his offer is actually a 45-55 split, which is a slight improvement for me compared to his previous offer.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal than my previous offer, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round with even more inflation.
