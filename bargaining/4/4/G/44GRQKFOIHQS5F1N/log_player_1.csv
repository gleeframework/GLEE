"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 599999,
""bob_gain"": 400001,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take a good deal while it lasts!""
}
``` 

This offer slightly favors Alice but is designed to entice Bob to accept in the first round. Here's why:

* **Time Value:** Bob knows that if he rejects this offer, the total pot shrinks to $900,000 in the next round due to inflation. 
* **Potential Losses:** Delaying means Bob risks getting a worse offer later, potentially ending up with even less than $400,001. 

The message aims to create urgency and frame the offer as favorable for Bob, increasing the chances of immediate acceptance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things a bit more fairly. This ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob's offer is a bit sneaky, trying to disguise a less favorable split as ""fair"".  While it seems balanced at first glance, the impact of inflation means that accepting this offer in Round 2 is worse for Alice than Bob's original offer in Round 1. 

Here's why:

* **Round 1 Value:** Bob's initial offer of $400,001 would have been worth $360,000 in Round 2 due to the 10% inflation.
* **Round 2 Reality:** His current offer of $450,000 may seem higher, but it's still less than the Round 1 equivalent.

By rejecting this offer, Alice signals that she's not easily fooled by framing and understands the time pressure involved. It also puts the pressure back on Bob to make a more compelling offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is it, Bob. A final offer for a truly fair split. Take it or leave it - time is running out for both of us.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **The Power of 50/50:**  While Alice was aiming slightly higher, presenting a 50/50 split in Round 3 is a powerful psychological tool. It appears undeniably fair and puts the pressure on Bob.
* **Creating Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the ""final offer"" and the dwindling value of the money.  This aims to make Bob realize that further haggling might lead to an even worse outcome for him.
* **Avoiding Greed:**  Had Alice countered with a slightly higher offer in her favor (e.g., 520,000 / 480,000), she would risk appearing greedy and potentially push Bob to gamble on another round, which could backfire due to the accelerating inflation."
