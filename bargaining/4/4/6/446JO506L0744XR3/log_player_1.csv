```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with. It's Bob's turn now!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $4000 gain is now worth less than before.

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better than a 60-40 split. It's my turn now!"

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering a 42-58 split, trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal. It's Bob's turn again!"

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating into my potential gains! With the 14.26% decrease, my $3500 gain is now worth even less.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better than a 35-65 split. It's my turn now!"

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating into my potential gains now. With the 22.62% decrease, my $3000 gain is worth significantly less than before.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because I don't want to risk going lower than a 30-70 split, and I think this is as good as it's going to get. It's a tough pill to swallow, but I'll take the $3000."
