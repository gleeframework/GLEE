"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor.  Since there are a lot of rounds left, I don't want to risk Bob rejecting my offer and then getting a better deal later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible deal for me.  Even though I'm losing money with each round, Bob is offering me only $5, while taking the vast majority.  I'm better off holding out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15} 
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm trying to be more reasonable this time.  Bob seems aggressive, so I need to offer him a bit more, but not too much, in case he rejects and I get a better deal later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation is making it even worse. I'm willing to take some risk and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm still trying to maximize my share, but inflation is getting serious. I'm starting to worry that Bob might get even more greedy and we'll end up with nothing.  I'm offering him a slightly larger share this time to try and avoid that outcome."
