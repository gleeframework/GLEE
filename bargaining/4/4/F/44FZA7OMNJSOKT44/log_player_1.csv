Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer. Let's get this done quickly before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're losing a lot of money with each passing round. Let's be practical and split it 55/45 in my favor. It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to wear me down with the threat of inflation, but he's still aiming for a larger share. I'm willing to be somewhat flexible, but I won't accept anything less than an even split.  I need to signal I'm serious about walking away if necessary."
