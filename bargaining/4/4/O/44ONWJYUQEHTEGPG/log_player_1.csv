"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll still give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the numbers are:

Alice's gain: $200,000 (worth 95% of $200,000 from the previous round)
Bob's gain: $800,000 (worth 80% of $1,000,000 from the previous round)

I'm not thrilled about the significant imbalance in the offer, but I'll consider it. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the risk of potentially getting an even worse deal in the next round.

For now, I'll decide to reject the offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth 25% of its original value. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a larger share, but I still want a decent amount for myself""
}
```

I'm proposing a 37.5/62.5 split, which seems more favorable to Bob, but I'm still trying to get a reasonable share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money. With the adjustments, the numbers are:

Alice's gain: $100,000 (worth 10.11% of $1,000,000 from the original amount)
Bob's gain: $900,000 (worth 90% of $1,000,000 from the original amount)

I'm not thrilled about the extremely lopsided offer, and the consolation prize of $100,000 is not very appealing, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a hit on the value of the money. At this point, I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a decent share.

With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth 6.35% of its original value. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the extremely reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60000,
  ""bob_gain"": 940000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a tiny share, but I hope you'll consider this a fair offer""
}
```

I'm proposing a 0.6/99.4 split, which is a very small share for me, but I'm hoping Bob will consider it a fair offer given the circumstances."
