"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide it fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5600, ""alice_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""I understand you want a fair deal, but I need to plan for the future. This offer helps us both.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** It's crucial to recognize that with each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob (20% per round) and moderately for Alice (10% per round). This means Bob needs to aim for a larger share in the earlier rounds to compensate.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  By offering Alice slightly less than her initial proposal, but still a reasonable amount, Bob aims to entice her while maximizing his potential gain. 
* **Message:** The message emphasizes understanding Alice's desire for fairness while highlighting the importance of a forward-looking agreement that benefits both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting to acknowledge the impact of inflation, but her offer still doesn't fully reflect the rapid devaluation of Bob's potential earnings. While tempting, accepting now would lock Bob into a significantly disadvantaged position. It's worth risking another round to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""This offer accounts for the decreasing value over time. Let's settle this now and both benefit.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** This is a critical round. If Bob doesn't secure a favorable agreement now, the effects of inflation will severely diminish the value of any potential winnings.
* **Assertive but Fair:** Bob's offer reflects the urgency of the situation. It's a significant increase from Alice's previous offer but is presented as a solution that benefits both parties by avoiding further losses due to inflation.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and emphasizes that this offer is a realistic compromise considering the time-sensitive nature of their negotiation."
