Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly and avoid the negative effects of inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk losing even more money by rejecting and then having to make a counter-offer."
