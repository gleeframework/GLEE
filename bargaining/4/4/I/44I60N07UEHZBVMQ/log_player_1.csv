"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a very bold offer, but I believe in my negotiation skills. If Bob rejects this, I will be able to make a more reasonable offer next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is an unfair offer. I will make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

This time I'm offering an even split. It's fair and avoids further back and forth."
