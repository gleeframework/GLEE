"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. With the 20% inflation, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,000 (80% of $5,000). Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth $4,500 (90% of $5,000).

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
