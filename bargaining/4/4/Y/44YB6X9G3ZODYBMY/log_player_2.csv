"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** My offer from round 2 was rejected, and inflation is affecting my earnings negatively. 
* **Alice's Offer:** Even though I'm getting less than my original proposal in round 1, it's still more than Alice's counter-offer in round 2. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing the game risks further inflation and a potentially less favorable offer from Alice. Accepting is a better choice to secure a decent amount."
