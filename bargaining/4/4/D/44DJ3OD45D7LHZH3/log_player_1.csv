Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split. If we keep going, I'll lose even more value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see how this plays out. Bob is undervaluing the impact of inflation on his returns, which will work in my favor as the game progresses."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 6500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share to offset the increasing loss from inflation. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the impact of inflation. I can afford to be patient and wait for a better offer."
