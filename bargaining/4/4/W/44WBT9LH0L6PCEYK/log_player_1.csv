Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer.  I'm taking almost everything, leaving Bob with a small amount.  I'm hoping he'll be surprised and accept, especially since he doesn't know about the inflation yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is fair, and it's better than the risk of getting nothing at the end of the game.  Inflation will continue to eat away at our potential gains, so I'm better off taking what I can get now."
