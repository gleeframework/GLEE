Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. It's a good deal for both of us, especially with the inflation working against us. Let's wrap this up! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is trying to rush me into a deal.  While her offer isn't terrible, I'm confident I can get a slightly better split in the next round or two.  The inflation is working in my favor, and I'm willing to bet Alice will become more agreeable to avoid losing even more value."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. Don't let inflation eat away at your share any further.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my guns with the 50/50 split. By now, Alice can clearly see I'm not going to accept anything less, and the pressure of the inflation is mounting.  This offer is firm, fair, and avoids further losses for both of us."
