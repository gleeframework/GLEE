Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to start being realistic. I'm losing more value each round, and Alice seems unwilling to budge much. Taking $43 now, while not ideal, is better than risking getting even less later or nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
