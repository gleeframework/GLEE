"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't get too excited 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not thrilled with the 40/60 split, and I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, but I'm still willing to compromise. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is significantly better than my previous one, and I'm not willing to accept a 52/48 split. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm still willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm trying to push for a better deal for myself, but I'm not willing to be too aggressive. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, I'll give you a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to bite!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've been pushing too hard for a better deal, and Bob's offer is starting to look more attractive. I'll accept this offer and take the 48/52 split. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than nothing, and I'm not willing to risk going to another round with the money continuing to lose value."
