Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is compromising, it's important to consider the bigger picture.  We're past the halfway point, and the money is losing value rapidly. Holding out for a slightly better deal in the next round or two is still strategically viable."
