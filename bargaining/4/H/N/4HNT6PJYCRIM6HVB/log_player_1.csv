"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of 5000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the original value. In that case, I'd be getting 4500, which is less than my initial offer of 6000. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the 10% decrease in value with each round, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the equivalent value of my initial offer in this round. My initial offer was 6000, and 27.1% less than that is 6000 * 0.271 = 1629. I'd be getting 4500, which is more than the equivalent value of my initial offer. I'll accept this offer.
