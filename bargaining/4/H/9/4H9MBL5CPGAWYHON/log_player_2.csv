"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of you, Bob. I believe this is fair considering the risk and potential future inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. I believe I can get a better deal, especially considering the potential for inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. I believe this is a fairer reflection of the potential for future inflation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and Bob's proposal, I propose a 60/40 split in your favor. I believe this maintains fairness while accounting for the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I will accept this offer. The 60/40 split is better than my previous proposal, and since I don't know how much inflation affects Alice, accepting this offer seems like the best option."
