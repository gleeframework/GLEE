"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential for inflation. I'm confident Bob will see this as a good deal, especially as the longer we wait, the less each dollar is worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the 50/50 split is a fair compromise considering the inflation. Accepting this offer is the safest option to secure at least some money."
