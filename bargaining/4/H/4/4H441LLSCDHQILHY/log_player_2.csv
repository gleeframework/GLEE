"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is inching up her offer, but it's still highly in her favor.  The threat of inflation means we need to push for a more equitable split sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""This is a fair deal given the inflation. Let's not lose more money by dragging this out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm conceding slightly from a perfect 50/50 split to encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Urgency:** Highlighting the inflation factor emphasizes the need for a quick agreement. 
* **Framing:** By stating it's a ""fair deal,"" I aim to make my offer appear more reasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, let's end this 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Time Pressure:** With seven rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing significantly.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game continues, the less valuable the money becomes. 
* **Alice's Concessions:** While small, Alice is moving towards a more balanced split. It's unlikely she'll offer significantly more than this.

It's better to secure something now, even if it's slightly less than we'd like, than risk losing everything to inflation."
