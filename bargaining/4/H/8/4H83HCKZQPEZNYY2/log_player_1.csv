"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still trying to get a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share for myself. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even division of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm not getting ripped off completely! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth significantly less due to inflation, I think I have the upper hand in this negotiation. I'll try to push for an even better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob, but I'm still willing to give you a chance!""

# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains being worth significantly less due to inflation, I think I'm in a strong position. However, Bob is getting desperate, and I'm not sure if he'll be willing to make a better offer.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not thrilled about it.
