Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll meet you halfway. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share this time.  It's still a fair deal considering inflation is hitting you harder. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
