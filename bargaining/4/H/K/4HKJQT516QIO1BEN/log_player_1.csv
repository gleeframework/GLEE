"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I would get $6,000 and Bob would get $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the new offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'm not getting as much as I would have liked.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 45-55 split!""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, where I would get $4,500 and Bob would get $5,500. I hope this offer is more appealing to Bob!"
