"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 70 and you can take 30. We can discuss further if you'd like to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a relatively even split, but I'm giving myself a slight advantage. The message is friendly and inviting, but also makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the 50-50 split because I think I can do better. With the inflation affecting my gains, I want to try to get a larger share now to compensate for the future losses."

```

}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60, which is a 10% increase from the 50-50 split Bob proposed. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this compromise, but I'm still leaving room for further negotiation."

}
```

I'm increasing my share to 65, which is a 14.29% increase from the 45-55 split Bob proposed. I'm trying to take advantage of the current market conditions and get as much as I can, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer."
