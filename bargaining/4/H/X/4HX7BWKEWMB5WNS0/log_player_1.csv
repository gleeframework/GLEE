"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering Bob $10 and keeping $90 for myself.  This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but I want to see if Bob will accept it or try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation and the fact that I'll be the one making the offer next round.  It's better to secure half now than risk getting nothing."
