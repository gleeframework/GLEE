"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a slightly bigger share, since the money will be worth less for you in the next round.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less for me due to inflation, I'm willing to give in a bit. However, I still think 4000 is a bit low.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think 4500 is a fair amount for me.""}

I'm increasing my offer to 4500, but still keeping a slight edge. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
