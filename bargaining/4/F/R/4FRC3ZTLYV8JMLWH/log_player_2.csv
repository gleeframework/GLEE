Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor this time.""}\n\nSince I'm Bob, I'll start by offering a division that slightly favors me, considering the inflation rates.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Alice's offer from round 3. Although the offer seems like a compromise, I believe I can negotiate for a better share considering the significant impact of inflation on Alice's gains. Let's see what the next round brings!\n\nPlease let me know how the game proceeds!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Since I'm Bob, I'll make a new offer. Considering the current state of inflation, I'll propose a division that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I'll offer Alice a smaller share this time, hoping she'll accept before the money loses even more value.\n\nHere's my offer: {""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split now.""}\n\nLet me know how Alice responds!"
