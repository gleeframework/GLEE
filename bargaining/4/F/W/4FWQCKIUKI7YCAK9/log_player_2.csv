"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 70-30, I'll take the majority but it's a fair start 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the potential inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair offer considering the time we have left."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split. I'm still willing to give you a decent share, but I need to get a good chunk of the money too. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer a larger share, it's getting late in the game, and the risk of getting nothing is higher. 55-45 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to secure at least 45."
