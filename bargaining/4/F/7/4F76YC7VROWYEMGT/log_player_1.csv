This is a classic ultimatum game with a twist, so let's see how this plays out! I'm offering a very generous share to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is playing the game very aggressively! I'm not going to accept this offer, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. It's time to show him that I'm willing to play hardball too."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but still offering Bob a decent amount.  Inflation is a factor, but I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to take the deal before the value of the money drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is really pushing his luck here! Even though the money is worth less now, I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal.  He's already lost a significant amount due to the inflation, and I'm not going to let him get away with this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still offering Bob a decent portion, but the inflation is starting to really hurt now.  This is my last chance to offer him a deal before the money becomes nearly worthless for him. I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to take what he can get than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unacceptable. The value of the money has decreased significantly for both of us, but I'm not going to be bullied into a bad deal. I'm willing to risk getting nothing at all to see if we can reach a more equitable split in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is getting very serious. I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm hoping the increasingly severe inflation will finally push Bob towards a more reasonable deal.  He's going to lose a lot more if we continue to stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided. I know he's feeling the effects of the inflation severely, but I'm willing to see this through to the end.  I'm not going to settle for such a small share of the remaining money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're down to the wire. The inflation is crippling the value of the money, especially for Bob. I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the circumstances. I believe this is the best way to salvage something from this game before we both end up with nothing."
