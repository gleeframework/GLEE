6000.0,4000.0,I propose dividing the money with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. Let me know if this works for you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair, considering the inflation that will affect us both.  Let's get this done in round 2!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose a 52/48 split in favor of Alice. This keeps the difference between our shares minimal while accounting for the decreasing value of money over time.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,Let's split the money 55/45 in my favor. This compromise accounts for the inflation and hopefully gets us closer to an agreement.,Bob,4,
