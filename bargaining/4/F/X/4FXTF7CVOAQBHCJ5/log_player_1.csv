Bob is holding firm, but time is working against me more than him.  I need to signal I'm willing to move significantly to encourage a counter offer, but I won't accept a deal this bad."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is trying to wear me down, but I need to hold firm for one more round.  He's shown he's willing to meet in the middle, but is clearly trying to push me to the absolute limit. I need to convey that the clock is a factor for both of us now."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  This is the best possible outcome for both of us.  Accept it, and let's move on. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful, but I need to accept.  Bob is clearly unwilling to go to a true 50/50 split, and with each round, my position worsens. It's better to walk away with something than risk getting nothing at all if this goes to the final round."
