"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first offer. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my $8,000 gain from the previous round is now worth $7,200. Bob's offer is $5,000 for me, which is worth 90% of $5,500, so it's a better deal than my previous offer.

I'll accept this offer.
