I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $9,000 and Bob $1,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

I'm going to try a slightly more even split this time, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer. This seems like a good balance of securing a good amount for myself while also being open to negotiation."

While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the shrinking value of the money, I'm still not willing to accept such a lopsided offer. I'm hoping to reach a more even split in the next round."
