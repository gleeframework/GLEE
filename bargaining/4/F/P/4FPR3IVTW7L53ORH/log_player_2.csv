Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. This offer is still generous, and time is working against you with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 450000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm making a concession, but this is my final offer. Let's close the deal and not risk losing more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me, but her concessions are too small.  It's getting risky, but I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a serious offer. I'm acknowledging your position of strength but also need you to recognize that the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains. Let's make this deal and avoid further losses."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it. I'm offering you a fair deal considering the inflation.  We're running out of time, let's be smart and take it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, but the clock is becoming a major factor now.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything significantly better, and the longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation. Accepting 400,000 is better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
