Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start.  We both get a good share, and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our gains in the future rounds.

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
