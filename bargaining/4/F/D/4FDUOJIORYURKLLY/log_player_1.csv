"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000, which seems like a fair split to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being generous. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since Bob's offer is still not as favorable as my initial proposal, I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. This way, we can both end the game with a decent amount.""
}
```

This offer gives us both $5,000, which is a more even split than before."
