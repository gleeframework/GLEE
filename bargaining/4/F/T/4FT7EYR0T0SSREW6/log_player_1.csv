"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% and take 80%""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small portion of the money, but it's a fair split, and I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 20/80 split.  Let's try a more even 55/45 split. It's fairer and gives us both a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less, so the offer from Bob is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4275,
  ""bob_gain"": 5525,
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 45% share, considering the initial amount is $10,000. I want to squeeze out a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial amount. This way, I'll take 60% and you'll get 40%""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60% in this offer, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it down the middle. 50/50 seems like the most fair way to divide the money. It's a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 14.26% less than the original, so the offer from Bob is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4321.04,
  ""bob_gain"": 4678.96,
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a 50/50 split, the inflation has reduced my gain by a significant amount, making the effective split more skewed towards Bob. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial amount. This way, I'll take 70% and you'll get 30%""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 70% in this offer, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand we're both trying to get the best deal, but it's getting late. This is my final offer: 4500 for me, 5500 for you. Let's not let inflation eat away at our potential gains any further. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 22.62% less than the original, so the offer from Bob is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4269.18,
  ""bob_gain"": 4730.82,
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, although it's not the highest share I could have gotten, it's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk further negotiations with the inflation eating away at my potential gains."
