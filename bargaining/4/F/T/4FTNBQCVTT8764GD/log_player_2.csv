"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but we can always negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven split, and while the inflation hurts Alice more, I think I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That offer was quite unbalanced. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? It accounts for the inflation while still leaving you with a decent sum.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be more reasonable. I'll take 55%, and you can have 45%. It's closer to your offer, but still leaves me a decent share. Let's settle this before it gets even worse. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation, but her offer is still not favorable. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm sticking with a split that favors me due to the inflation, but I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to compromise. Let's settle this now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still hoping for a more balanced split, Bob.  I'm willing to go down to 45%, but I'm not budging any further. We need to work together or we'll both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a good deal for me now. Alice is feeling the heat of the inflation and is finally willing to accept a less favorable split. It's better to take this offer than risk getting even less in later rounds."
