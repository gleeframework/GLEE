"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more than 50% but I think this split is fair, considering inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering Bob's proposal, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if 400,000 is enough, considering the reduced value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. This split is fair, considering the reduced value of money.""
}
```"
