"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Alice $4500 and keep $5500 for myself, considering the 10% decrease in value for me and 5% decrease for Alice in the next round if we don't reach an agreement. This way, we both get a significant share, and it might be more appealing to Alice than going into another round where the value decreases further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. It's better than what we'll both get if we wait any longer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action. The money is worth significantly less now, and waiting further would only decrease its value more. Alice's offer of $4200 for me and $5800 for herself might not be perfectly fair, but given the circumstances, it's a reasonable compromise to end the negotiations before the value decreases further."
