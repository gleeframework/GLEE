"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small share, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we split the money fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than last time. Let's split it 55-45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 45 * 0.9 = 40.5
* Bob gain: 55 * 0.9 = 49.5

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
