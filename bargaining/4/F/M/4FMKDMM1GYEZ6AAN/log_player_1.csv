Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly and avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, and while I'm facing inflation, it's still not worth accepting.  I'll make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than my initial offer, but it's still a fair split considering the inflation that has occurred. Let's see if he's willing to accept."
