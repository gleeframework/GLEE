"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the total amount, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'm effectively getting 700,000 * 0.95 = 665,000. 

Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he's effectively getting 700,000 * 0.8 = 560,000.

I'll reject this offer. My gain is still higher than Bob's, and I'm willing to negotiate further. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's gain was 700,000 in the previous round, I'll try to increase my gain to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves some room for negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
