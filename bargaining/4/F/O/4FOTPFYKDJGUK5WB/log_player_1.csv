"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose to take $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. This way I get the lion's share, but I'm leaving some for Bob in the hopes he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more,  the inflation is starting to hurt Bob more than me. Accepting this offer secures me $4,000 which is still a decent amount."
