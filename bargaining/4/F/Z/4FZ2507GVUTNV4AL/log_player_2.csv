Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the extreme impact of inflation on your gains, this is my most reasonable offer yet 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

At this point, the effects of inflation are severe. While getting only $150,000 is far from ideal, rejecting this offer means risking an even lower amount in subsequent rounds.  Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation situation, but there's a high chance she'll offer even less in the next round."
