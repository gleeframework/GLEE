"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise a little more. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor.  This is my final offer - if you reject it, we both risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  While the risk of getting nothing increases as we approach the 12th round, accepting a bad deal now sets a bad precedent. It's unlikely Alice would offer anything worse than a 50/50 split as we get closer to the deadline."
