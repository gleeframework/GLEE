"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is slightly less than half, but still a reasonable amount. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, while also setting the stage for potential future negotiations. By framing my offer as ""fair,"" I'm trying to create a psychological anchor that will influence Bob's perception of future offers.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn! What will he decide?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is more reasonable considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although he's trying to appear reasonable by mentioning inflation, his offer still doesn't account for the significantly higher rate of inflation affecting my share. With my share being worth 20% less each round, I need to prioritize getting a larger amount to offset this loss. Bob's offer of 45 dollars for me is not sufficient, especially considering he's only losing 5% value per round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try and get a better deal.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation difference, I'm being generous""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer than the first round, taking into account the fact that my share is worth 20% less due to inflation, while Bob's share is only worth 5% less. By offering Bob 42 dollars, I'm still giving him a decent amount, but also prioritizing my own gain to offset the higher rate of inflation affecting me.\n\nThe message is an attempt to frame my offer as generous, given the circumstances, and to make Bob feel that he's getting a relatively good deal despite the uneven inflation rates.\n\nWill Bob accept this offer, or will we continue negotiating?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. The value will only decrease from here, it's in our best interest to settle now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer, despite his message framing it as his ""final offer."" Given the significant difference in inflation rates, accepting 40 dollars at this point would mean I'm actually getting a much worse deal than initially meets the eye. With my share being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm effectively getting a very small portion of the original value.\n\nBob's attempt to create a sense of urgency by stating it's his ""final offer"" and that the value will only decrease from here is a common negotiation tactic. However, I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially considering Bob's relatively low rate of inflation loss. I'll continue to push for a better deal, hoping that Bob's eagerness to settle might lead him to concede more in the next round.\n\nLet's proceed and see how Bob reacts!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm making a slightly more conservative offer than before, taking into account the significant decrease in value due to inflation. By offering Bob 50 dollars, I'm effectively giving him a larger share of the remaining value, while also trying to secure a decent amount for myself.\n\nThe message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's rational side, highlighting the fact that we're both losing value due to inflation. By framing my offer as a "" compromise,"" I'm trying to create a sense of mutual understanding and shared interests, which might encourage Bob to accept this offer and end the negotiation.\n\nWill Bob accept this offer, or will we continue negotiating?\n\n{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""We're both losing value, let's compromise""}"
