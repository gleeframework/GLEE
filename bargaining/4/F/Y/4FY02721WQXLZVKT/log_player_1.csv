Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. Since this is the first round, I'm trying to secure a large portion of the money before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share,  accepting this 50/50 split is the most rational decision. The inflation rate is significant, and rejecting this offer means a potential 10% loss for me in the next round. It's better to secure a fair amount now rather than risk losing more in the future."
