Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money almost evenly, Bob. I get a little more as I'm taking a bigger risk with inflation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest, but since we're both facing inflation, I'll accept a slight disadvantage to ensure we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
