Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, it's my turn to make a proposal. Given the 20% inflation, the money is now worth 80% of its original value, so we're effectively playing with $8,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value. With Alice's offer, I would get $6,400 (64% of $10,000) and Alice would get $7,200 (72% of $10,000).

Since I would be getting less than my previous offer, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 4, the money is worth 51.2% of its original value due to the 20% inflation.

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 6400, ""alice_gain"": 3600}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is now worth 40.96% of its original value. With Alice's offer, I would get $4,096 (40.96% of $10,000) and Alice would get $5,920 (59.04% of $10,000).

I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair split and I don't want to risk going into the next round with less money.
