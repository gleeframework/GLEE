"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as it ensures both of us get something while giving me the majority share since I'm the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, given the inflation and the fact that Bob is willing to split it evenly, this is the best I can get."
