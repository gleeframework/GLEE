"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm taking on the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's worth trying to get a better deal, especially since the money is losing value for Alice at a faster rate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need you to meet me closer to the middle on this. The clock is ticking, and the deal is getting worse for both of us with this inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
The inflation is hurting Alice more, and I'm getting a slight increase compared to the first round.  It's a good deal."
