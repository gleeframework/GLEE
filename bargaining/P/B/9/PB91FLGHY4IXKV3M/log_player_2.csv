Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit more this time 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
While Alice's offer is better than her previous one, it's still not a fair split considering the inflation is hitting her harder. I'll see if she'll budge in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is fair considering inflation is hurting you more.  We both get something, and we don't waste any more time.""}
