"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Even though the offer is less than Alice's initial proposal, the inflation has hit me hard. My 300,000 from Round 1 is now worth significantly less.
* **Risk:**  If I reject this offer, I'm risking Alice offering me even less in the next round. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal.

It's a tough choice, but accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, even though it's less than I initially wanted."
