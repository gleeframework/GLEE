"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, trying to squeeze out a bit more for myself while still leaving Bob with a decent share."
