Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's end the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair one, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's message: A decent offer, but I'm hoping for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, I need to be more cautious. I'll think carefully about this offer.

```

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the inflation:

I'm offering a slightly more balanced split, but still keeping a slight edge for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
