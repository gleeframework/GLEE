"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split it 55-45, a fair start for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make the most of it. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5400,
  ""bob_gain"": 4600,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try 54-46!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a reasonable 46% of the total. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 50-50 seems like the best way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less, I need to be more cautious. A 50-50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

After considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer.
