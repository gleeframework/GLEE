"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 30 dollars.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, let's split it right down the middle. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amount I would gain is $50 * 0.95 = $47.50.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
