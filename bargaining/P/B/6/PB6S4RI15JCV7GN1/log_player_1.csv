"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think a 60:40 split is more fair. It's a better deal for me as we move into round 2 and inflation starts to affect the value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
