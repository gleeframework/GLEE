"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, let's see if we can do better later.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll consider the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal, considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, so my gain of $5000 is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to find a sweet spot, let's see if this one works 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6000 in the third round is now worth 32.8% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a bit more reasonable:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $4500 for me and $5500 for him."
