"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob, with a message suggesting a fair division considering the impact of inflation on the money's value over the rounds. This division slightly favors me, as I am the one making the first offer, but still gives Bob a substantial amount. The message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the strategic consideration of future rounds where the money's value decreases more significantly for me than for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts us in a tough spot. Let's be more realistic. This offer gives us both a chance to benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the decrease in value due to inflation, accepting $4,000 in the second round (which is effectively worth less than the original $4,000 due to the 10% decrease in value for me) seems unfair given that Bob's portion is significantly larger and decreases in value less. By rejecting this offer, I aim to push for a more balanced division in the next rounds, considering the differing impacts of inflation on our gains.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the last offer, I'm willing to compromise but also need to account for the higher inflation impact on my side.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to $5,800 for myself and $4,200 for Bob, slightly reducing my share from the initial offer to show willingness to compromise. The message explains my reasoning, emphasizing the need to account for the higher inflation impact on my side. This approach aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob while still considering the strategic implications of future value decreases.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm proposing a deal that acknowledges the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable outcome. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the increasing pressure from inflation and the rounds passing, the offer of $3,800 for me (which is now effectively worth significantly less due to the 27.1% decrease in value from the first round) and $6,200 for Bob does not seem to adequately compensate for the differing impacts of inflation on our gains. By rejecting, I aim to push for a division that more equitably shares the burden of inflation or to wait for an opportunity to make a counteroffer that better reflects the current value of the money to both of us.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""We're both losing value each round. This offer splits the difference more fairly, considering the inflation impact.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to $5,600 for myself and $4,400 for Bob, aiming to find a compromise that acknowledges the increasing loss of value for both of us but still recognizes the greater impact of inflation on my potential gains. The message appeals to Bob's understanding of our shared loss and the need for a fair division that considers the current state of the game. This approach seeks to balance the strategic pressure of decreasing value with the need for a mutually acceptable agreement.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  This offer is my final concession.  It reflects the urgency of the situation. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant decrease in value due to inflation and the fact that we are halfway through the rounds, I accept Bob's offer of $3,500 for myself and $6,500 for Bob. Although the division is not ideal and the value of the money has decreased substantially, the risk of continuing and possibly ending up with nothing or an even worse division due to the increasing pressure of inflation makes accepting this offer the most pragmatic choice. The difference in the rate of value decrease between us (40.95% for me vs. 22.62% for Bob) also suggests that waiting longer may disadvantage me further.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
