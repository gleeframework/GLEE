"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide it fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer seems ""fair"" on the surface, but it heavily favors Alice in the long run due to the inflation rates. I need to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts us in a tough spot. Let's be more realistic. This offer gives us both a chance to benefit.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the last offer, I'm willing to compromise but also need to account for the higher inflation impact on my side. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but this offer is still unacceptable.  The inflation difference means I need a larger share upfront to make this worthwhile. I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6200,
""alice_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm proposing a deal that acknowledges the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable outcome.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing value each round. This offer splits the difference more fairly, considering the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is still not good enough. While Alice is acknowledging the shrinking pot, her offer doesn't reflect the significantly faster rate at which her potential gains are depreciating.  I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger portion."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This offer is my final concession.  It reflects the urgency of the situation.""}
