"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to be too greedy! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer, as I think I can do better than meeting in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly higher share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to get a bit closer to my desired share. Now it's up to Bob to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's revised offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 52-48 is a reasonable split, and I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. I'll take the $5200 and consider the game over."
