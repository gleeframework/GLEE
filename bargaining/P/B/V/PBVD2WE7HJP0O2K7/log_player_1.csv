"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal this time, let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5000$ is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... But I'll decide to reject it. My goal is to get a better deal than a 50-50 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 80% = 64%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to keep a slight edge.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55-45 split, trying to maintain a slight advantage while still being somewhat reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to make up for lost time, will you take this deal? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000$ is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%).

This offer is a 40-60 split, which is a significant disadvantage for me. I'll reject it.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (48.8% * 51.2% = 25.0048%, but I'll approximate it to 25%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I want it to be worth something.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 65-35 split, trying to make my share worth something in the current inflationary environment."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still want a decent share, will you take this? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 3000$ is now worth 3.28% of what it was in the first round (100% - 96.72% = 3.28%).

This offer is a 30-70 split, which is extremely unfavorable for me. I'll reject it.
