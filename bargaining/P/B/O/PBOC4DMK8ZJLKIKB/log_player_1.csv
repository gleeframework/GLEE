```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""

I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message that suggests I'm being somewhat generous, but also acknowledging that I'm taking a bit more than half. Let's see how Bob responds!"

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 57,

}
```

I've taken into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's previous offer was a 55-45 split in his favor. I'm trying to find a middle ground between our two previous offers, while also considering that the money is worth a bit less to me now. Let's see how Bob responds!"
