"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering you 400k. Accept and we can split the cash.""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. I'm offering you 400k, and I'll take 600k. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting! My gain is worth 10% less, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, which is a bigger hit.

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer, as it's still a 50-50 split, and I'd like to try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I was thinking more like 55-45. Want to try again?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next offer! Since the money is worth 10% less again due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""How about a 49-51 split? I'm trying to be reasonable!""
}
```"
