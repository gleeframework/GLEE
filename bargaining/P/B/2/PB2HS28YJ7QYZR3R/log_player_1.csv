"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor, as the first round is the best chance for me to get a large share.  Let's see if Bob is greedy or fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal. Even though I'd receive less due to inflation, it's still significantly lower than my initial 900,000. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split in my favor. While inflation has reduced the value of the money I'll receive, I believe this is still a reasonable offer, considering Bob's previous proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I would gain, Bob's offer is now better than what I could potentially get in the next round. The potential gains from rejecting and proposing in the next round would be significantly lower due to inflation. I will accept this offer to secure some of the remaining value."
