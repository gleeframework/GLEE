"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, a fair middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% reduction in value due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 5% less, but I'll assume it's $4,750.

Considering the reduced value of my gain, I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer. I'd rather negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
