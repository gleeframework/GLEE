"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, I know the value of the money decreases significantly for me with each round. It's better to push for a more favorable split while the money is still worth a significant amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you want to be fair, but the value decreases for me each round.  This offer accounts for that.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your loss, I'll be a bit more generous 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not favorable considering the rapid rate of inflation for me. I need to push for a more significant gain while it still holds value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to reach an agreement soon. This is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one. Alice is clearly trying to lowball me knowing the pressure is on with the decreasing value. However, accepting such a low amount would be a significant loss. I'm hoping she's bluffing about further negotiation and will make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  This offer is the best chance for both of us to gain something significant.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging much, your loss is increasing 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a difficult decision, but time is running out. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and while this offer isn't ideal, it's better to get something than nothing at this point. Accepting this offer will at least guarantee me some return, even if it's significantly less than what I was aiming for initially."
