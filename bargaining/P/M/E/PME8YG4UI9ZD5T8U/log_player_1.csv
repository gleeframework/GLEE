"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $4500 is worth 5% less than the $6000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $5700 in today's value.

I'm not thrilled with the 45-55 split, but I think it's a reasonable compromise. I accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
