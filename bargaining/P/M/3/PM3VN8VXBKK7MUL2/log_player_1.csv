I'm going for a greedy strategy here, Alice! I figure Bob is more likely to accept a tiny amount than risk getting nothing at all in the next round.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd love to see if I can get more, it's unlikely Bob will give me a better deal in the next round. This offer is fair, and I don't want to risk losing money to inflation."
