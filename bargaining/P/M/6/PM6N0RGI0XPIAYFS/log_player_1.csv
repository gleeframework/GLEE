"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal. I'm also trying to create a sense of fairness and cooperation with my message.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn! Please let me know if he accepts or rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic. How about a 55/45 split? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since I'm Alice, I'll evaluate the offer considering the inflation. Due to the 10% decrease in value for me, the offer of $550,000 is actually worth $495,000 in terms of the original value. For Bob, the 5% decrease means his $450,000 is worth $427,500 in original value.\n\nGiven this, I still think I can negotiate for a better deal, so I'll reject the offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers.""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'm trying to find a middle ground between our previous offers. Since the value of the money decreases more for me, I'm trying to find a compromise that still benefits me but is also reasonable for Bob.\n\nI've decreased my initial offer of 60% to 58%, hoping that Bob will see this as a sign of good faith and be willing to accept it.\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 565000 
# Bob gain: 435000
