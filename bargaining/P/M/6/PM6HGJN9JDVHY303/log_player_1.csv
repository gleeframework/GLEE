"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%. I'm trying to be generous, but also want to get the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $3200.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair, but I'll consider it. I'll decide to reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, my gain of $4000 in the previous round is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $3200. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no more negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to end the game with a fair deal."
