"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation impacts you more, but a 55/45 split is too much in your favor. Let's compromise at 52/48. It's a fairer deal with the inflation considered. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52
