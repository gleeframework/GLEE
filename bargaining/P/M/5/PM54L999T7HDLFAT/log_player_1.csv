"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased by 20%!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. The 300,000 I would gain is not enough for me, especially considering the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I was hoping for a better split, and 45% is still a bit too low for me, especially considering the decreasing value of money.
