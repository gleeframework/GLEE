Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I think I can do better. Remember, my share isn't losing value... 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is hurting me significantly. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, and I risk getting nothing if I reject and continue the game."
