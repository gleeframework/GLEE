"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 

I propose to take $95 and leave $5 for Bob.  This is a fair starting point, and hopefully, Bob will see that accepting this offer is in his best interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more, accepting this offer ensures I get some money.  Given the inflation, it's likely Bob will continue to offer me less in the future.  It's better to take what I can now."
