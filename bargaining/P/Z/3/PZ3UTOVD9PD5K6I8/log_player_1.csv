Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I still think I can do better. I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to give away the whole farm!

While Bob's offer isn't ideal, the inflation is working against me. It's better to secure a decent amount than to risk getting a much smaller share later."
