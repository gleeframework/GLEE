Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to 55/45, but I think we need to move quickly before inflation makes this even less worthwhile. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for both of us due to inflation, and given that Alice is now offering a 55/45 split, I think this is a reasonable compromise. Continuing to negotiate risks losing even more value, so I'll accept this offer."
