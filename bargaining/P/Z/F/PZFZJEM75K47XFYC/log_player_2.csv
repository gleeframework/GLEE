"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. I think this is a fair split to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current split doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round, despite the 5% decrease in value. Let's see what I can get if I make the next proposal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer. I'll propose a division that I think is more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that I think is more reasonable, considering the decrease in value for both of us. Since I'm willing to take a bit more risk, I'll aim for a slightly higher share, while still being somewhat considerate of Alice's perspective, given the higher depreciation rate on her end.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the depreciation, let's adjust the split to make it a bit more fair for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and it's losing value fast. I'll take a small hit here, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the significant depreciation in value for both of us, especially the 36% decrease on Alice's end, and the fact that she's indicating this is her final offer, I think accepting this proposal might be the wisest decision at this point. The difference in our proposed splits isn't drastic, and further rounds could lead to even less value for both parties.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's finalize the agreement before the value drops any further."
