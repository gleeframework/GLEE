"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives us both a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, Alice. This offer takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer ensures a fair deal considering the time pressure and inflation, Bob.  Let's settle this now and both walk away with something significant. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of money for both of us, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer doesn't seem to fully account for the disproportionate impact of inflation on her share. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a more mutually beneficial agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 460000, ""alice_gain"": 540000, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the accelerating inflation, especially on your end, I'm willing to take a bit more to compensate for the future loss but still offer you a significant amount. Let's finalize this before the value drops further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise considering the inflation.  Let's wrap it up - dragging this out only hurts us both. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Alice, I believe I'm in a stronger negotiating position. Alice's offer still doesn't fully reflect the disproportionate loss in value she's facing. I'll proceed to the next round, aiming to secure a better deal as the pressure mounts."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing significant value with each passing round. Given the substantial decrease in value for you, I'm willing to meet in the middle. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Let's end this before we both lose more.""}"
