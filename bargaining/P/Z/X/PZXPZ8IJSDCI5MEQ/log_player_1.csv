"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70/30, seems fair to me.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair and simple solution 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new inflation rates, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 50 * 0.9 = 45$ (10% less than the original 50$), and Bob's gain of 50$ is worth 50 * 0.95 = 47.5$ (5% less than the original 50$).

I don't think I like this offer. I'd rather not accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, it's a good compromise.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the current value of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of 40$ is worth 40 * 0.7279 = 29.16$ (27.1% less than the original 40$), and Bob's gain of 60$ is worth 60 * 0.8586 = 51.42$ (14.26% less than the original 60$).

I think this offer is a bit better than the previous one, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll think about it for a moment... 

After considering, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, it's a good middle ground.""
}
```

This way, I get 55% of the current value of the money, and Bob gets 45%."
