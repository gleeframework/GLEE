Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but I'm taking advantage of the faster inflation rate on your side. Let's make this a fair deal, but one that benefits me a little more. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not happy with that offer, Bob. It's not fair to take advantage of my higher inflation rate. Let's try to find a more balanced solution."
