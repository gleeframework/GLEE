"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm hoping you'll see the value in getting this deal done now.  The longer we wait, the less my offer will be worth to you. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice with each passing round, she may be more willing to compromise to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
