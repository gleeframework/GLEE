"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 20% of the total amount, which is $2000. I'll get the remaining 80%, which is $8000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, let's end it here 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8000 from the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'd get $7200 if I accepted the first offer. 

Considering Bob's new offer, I'd get $6000, which is worth 90% of $8000, and Bob would get $4000, which is the same as before.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
