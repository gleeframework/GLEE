"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  The inflation makes future rounds risky for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I could try for a better deal in the next round,  Bob's offer is fair and the inflation makes it risky to wait. Accepting a guaranteed $5,000 is better than potentially getting a worse deal later."
