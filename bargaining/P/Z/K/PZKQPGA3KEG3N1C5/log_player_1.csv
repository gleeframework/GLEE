"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000.  This feels like a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation to impact Bob more heavily in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split, with me receiving $700,000 and Bob receiving $300,000.  This is a compromise that reflects the increasing impact of inflation on Bob, but still provides a significant share of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, the inflation is hitting Bob much harder. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it is significantly less than my initial proposal. The risk of continuing and having Bob's offer get even worse is too high."
