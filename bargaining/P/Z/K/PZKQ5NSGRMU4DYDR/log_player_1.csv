"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, you can have 10% of the money, I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This offer is a generous one, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the 20% inflation that will come with each passing round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a quarter, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still want to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""A quarter is a bit too low for me, I was thinking more like 40-60 or 50-50.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% of the money, let's end this game before it gets worse with inflation!""
}
```"
