"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, we can discuss later""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $5000 is now worth $4000.

I don't think splitting it evenly is fair, considering I was willing to give you $4000 in the first round. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
