"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take more this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I don't like Bob's offer. He's taking a bigger share than before, and I'm getting less. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since the money is now worth 80% of its original value, I'll aim for a more balanced split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split this time. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, you'll have to do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is even more one-sided than before! With inflation, the money is worth even less, so I need to be careful not to give away too much.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll aim for an even more aggressive split. I'll try to get a bigger share to compensate for the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""You're not budging, I won't either. Meet me in the middle, but closer to me.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close, but I'm still not satisfied! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting even more one-sided! With inflation, the money is worth even less, and I'm getting a tiny share. I need to think carefully about this.

However, I'm not going to get a better offer if I don't accept this one. I'll take the 200,000$ and hope that it's enough to survive the remaining rounds.
