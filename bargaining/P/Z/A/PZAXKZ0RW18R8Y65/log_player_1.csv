"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was quite low. Let's be fair - we both deserve a significant share. How about a 60/40 split in your favor? 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
