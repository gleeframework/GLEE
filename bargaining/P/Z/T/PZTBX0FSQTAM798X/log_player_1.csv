"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, I'll get a decent chunk of the money upfront, while still leaving Bob with a reasonable amount to try to negotiate for in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $6000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4800. Bob's share of $4000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $3800.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a 50/50 split, and I'd rather take the guaranteed $4800 now than risk getting less in future rounds.
