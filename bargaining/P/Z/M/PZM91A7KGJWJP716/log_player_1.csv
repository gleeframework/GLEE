"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

This is my first offer. I am taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. I want to see if he's willing to accept this extremely unfair offer, or if he'll try to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. It is extremely unfair. Even though my gains are reduced due to inflation, I will still hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm sticking to my initial offer. I'll give Bob $1, and keep the rest for myself. I believe the inflation penalty will be enough to motivate him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am still rejecting the offer.  The inflation penalty is significant, but I am confident I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm finally willing to compromise. I'll offer Bob a 50/50 split.  With the increasing inflation penalty, I think this is the best offer I can make while still getting a reasonable share."
