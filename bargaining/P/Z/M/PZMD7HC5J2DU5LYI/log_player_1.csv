"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer. I'll take $90 and leave Bob with $10.  This sets a high bar for him and might lead to a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer. While it's better than getting nothing, the inflation is hurting me more than it is hurting Bob.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}

I'm going to lower my demand slightly to 85, but still try to get a good share. I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to take this offer, as the inflation is continuing to hurt both of us."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting. The inflation is hitting me hard, and I believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to keep pushing for a higher share, but I need to be mindful of the decreasing number of rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

```

I'm going to compromise a bit further and offer Bob 20.  We're getting close to the halfway point, and I need to start finding a balance between getting a good share and avoiding a stalemate.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer before the inflation hurts him even more."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

I'm going to stick to my previous strategy and continue trying to reach a compromise.  While the inflation is making each round riskier, I'm hoping that Bob will realize that accepting a fair deal is better than continuing to risk losing more."

The inflation is really hitting me hard now, and I need to be realistic. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing at all.  I'm accepting."
