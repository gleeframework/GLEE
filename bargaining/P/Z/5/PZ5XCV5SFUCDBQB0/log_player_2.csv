I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since we're playing with inflation, I believe this is a fair offer that gives me a better chance of coming out ahead while still leaving Alice with a significant portion of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer.  Although the inflation has reduced the value of the money, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal by continuing the game."
