"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the difference, or I'll make a better offer next round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is an attempt to get Bob to accept the offer and avoid further negotiations."
