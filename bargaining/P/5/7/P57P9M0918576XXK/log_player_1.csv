I'm going for a big chunk, but I want to make sure Bob feels like he's getting something worthwhile. Let's see how he responds!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm still aiming for a big share, but I'm lowering my offer a bit to make it more appealing to Bob.  Hopefully, he'll see that this is a fair compromise considering the inflation we're dealing with."

Round 5

I'm dropping my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority share.  I think this is the sweet spot where Bob might accept while I still get a decent amount.  Let's see what he thinks!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation. Bob's offer is still not great, but with each round, the money I get is worth less and less.  It's time to accept and move on."
