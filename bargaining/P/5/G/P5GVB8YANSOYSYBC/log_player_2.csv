"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I propose a 6000/4000 split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 4000$ gain is tempting, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal. The potential for inflation makes it risky to settle too early."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I believe a 60/40 split is more equitable. Let's be fair, but also consider that the value of our share may decrease with each passing round.""}
