I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. I want to get the majority of the money, but I'm also leaving Bob with something to incentivize him to accept.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though Bob flipped the script, I'm holding out for a better deal.  I know the money is losing value, but I'm confident I can get a better split in the next round.  Let's see what Bob's next move is."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 8000 for myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent chunk of the money. The inflation is starting to hit, and I need to be more realistic about what I can expect.  Hopefully, this will be enough to get Bob to accept."
