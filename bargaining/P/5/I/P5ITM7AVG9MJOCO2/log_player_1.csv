"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'll get a bit more, but Bob will still get a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to flip the script! I'll think for a moment...

I'll decide to reject this offer as well. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time for a new offer!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to get the better deal.

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation.

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```"
