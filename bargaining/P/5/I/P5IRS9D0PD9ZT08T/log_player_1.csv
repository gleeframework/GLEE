Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a decent share, but I compensate a bit for the higher devaluation on my end. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
