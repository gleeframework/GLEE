"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think a 60/40 split is a good place to begin. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With a 20% decrease in value for me and only a 10% decrease for Alice, I think I can negotiate a better deal. Besides, starting with a 60/40 split doesn't seem ""fair"" to me. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think a 55/45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both get a decent share, but I compensate a bit for the higher devaluation on my end.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is impacting us both differently.  Let's try a 50/50 split to be fair. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting the 50/50 split seems like the best option now. The money I gain is worth 36% less, and further negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome due to the increasing devaluation. It's time to settle on this fair offer from Alice."
