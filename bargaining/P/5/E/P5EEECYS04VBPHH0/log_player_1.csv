"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original 100$, which is $60, and leave 40% for Bob, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, the actual amounts I'd gain and Bob would gain are:

* My gain: 45 * 0.8 = 36
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.9 = 49.5

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. It's a bit more favorable than my previous offer, but I'm still not getting a great deal.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 40% of the original 100$, which is $40, and leave 60% for Bob, which is $60."
