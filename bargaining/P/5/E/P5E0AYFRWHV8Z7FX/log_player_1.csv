I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. I figure it's a fair starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary."

I'm still trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm aware the value of the money is decreasing for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before the inflation gets worse."
