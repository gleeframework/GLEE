I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  I figure if he's smart he'll accept it right away. But if not, I'll adjust my strategy in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is ridiculous.  I'm not going to be taken advantage of!  I know I can do better.  Let's see what Bob comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer a more reasonable split, but I'm still taking the lion's share.  I'm not going to settle for anything less than 900,000.  I'm confident that Bob will see reason and accept this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous! Bob seems to be playing the same game as me, just with reversed roles. I'm still not going to accept this. Let's see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is getting out of hand. I think it's time to compromise.  We both have equal chances to get this amount, so a 50/50 split is fair."
