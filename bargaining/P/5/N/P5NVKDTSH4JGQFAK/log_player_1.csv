"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. I think this is a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is meant to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less in this round, Bob's offer of $450,000 for me is actually equivalent to $360,000 in the first round (80% of $450,000). Considering this, I think I can get a better deal if I reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. Therefore, I will reject Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less in each round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. In this round, the money is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%). I'll offer Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still try to get a good deal for myself.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise!""}"
