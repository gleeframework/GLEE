Let's start with a fair 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'm going to try to bridge the gap by offering a slightly higher amount than Bob's previous proposal. I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer. Even with inflation, I can do better."

I'm going to stick with a 4000/6000 split.  Since Bob is getting the advantage of no inflation, I think it's reasonable to offer him a slightly higher percentage than the previous round.  We're getting close to the end of the game, and I want to avoid a scenario where I get a very low percentage."
