Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I'll keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  Since it's the first round, I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action. Bob is taking a significant share, but the inflation means it's likely to be less valuable to him in the next round. It's better to secure $1,000 now than risk getting less later."
