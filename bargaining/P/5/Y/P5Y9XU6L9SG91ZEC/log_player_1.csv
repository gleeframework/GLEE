Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small portion (100,000$) to hopefully secure his acceptance in the first round.  This way, I get the majority and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to take a toll.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something substantial."
