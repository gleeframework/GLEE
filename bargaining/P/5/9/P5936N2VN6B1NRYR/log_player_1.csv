I'm starting with a proposal that gives me the majority of the money, but I'm leaving a small amount for Bob to incentivize him to accept.  I'll see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  Even though my share is much lower than my initial proposal, the inflation means that the money I'm getting is worth less than it was in the previous round.  It's better to accept now and secure some value rather than risk further inflation and a smaller share."
