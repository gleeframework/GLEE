"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, Alice. I'm feeling generous this round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob is as generous as he claims!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 400,000 x 0.8 (20% less due to inflation) = 320,000
* Bob's gain: 600,000 x 0.95 (5% less due to inflation) = 570,000

I'll reject Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Thanks for the 'generosity', Bob, but I'm not buying it. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering a 42-58 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still reasonable considering the circumstances."
