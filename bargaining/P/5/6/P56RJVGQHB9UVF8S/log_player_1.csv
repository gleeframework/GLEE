"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is a bit less than the 50 I was initially offered. However, Bob's gain of 60 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant reduction.

I'm not thrilled about giving up a larger share, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer. Since Bob wanted a ""slight edge"" in the last round, I'll try to offer him a slightly smaller share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you a chance to match 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my proposed gain of 30 is actually a bit more reasonable than it initially seems.

However, I'm not thrilled about giving up a 70% share to Bob. I'll think about it for a moment...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer. Since Bob was willing to give me a ""chance to match"" in his last offer, I'll try to offer him a slightly smaller share this time.
