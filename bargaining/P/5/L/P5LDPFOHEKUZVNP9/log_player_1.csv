"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and simple offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 3000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $4500.

I'm not happy with the offer, as I'd like to get a bigger share considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not giving me enough, I want a bigger share""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so the total amount is now $9,000.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is fair""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is now worth 73.1% of what it was in the first round, so the total amount is now $7,310.

I'm not happy with the offer, as I'd like to get a bigger share considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're still not giving me enough, I want a bigger share""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 73.1% of what it was in the first round, so the total amount is now $7,310. However, I'll make an offer based on the original $10,000 to make the math easier.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split""
}
```"
