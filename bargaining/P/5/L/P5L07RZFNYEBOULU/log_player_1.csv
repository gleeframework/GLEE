"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 4:6 is a more reasonable ratio considering the initial amount. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
