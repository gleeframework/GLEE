"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it allows us to start with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the offer. Bob is trying to take the majority of the money, leaving me with a relatively small consolation prize. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep some for myself""}

I'm trying to be more generous this time, offering Bob a larger share of the money, but still keeping some for myself. I hope this offer is more appealing to Bob and that we can come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small token of appreciation, but I'm taking the majority 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. Bob is trying to take the majority of the money again, and the token of appreciation is a very small consolation prize. The money is already worth less due to inflation, and this offer is a slap in the face. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm trying to be more generous again, offering Bob a larger share of the money, but I'm not going to give in completely. I want to make sure I get a fair share of the money, considering the inflation and the value of the money is decreasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm taking the majority and securing my position 
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. The money is already worth very little due to inflation, and Bob is trying to take the majority of it. The small chunk I would get is barely worth anything. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me and leave me with almost nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 2000, ""bob_gain"": 8000, ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I want to make sure I get something decent""}

I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money at this point, considering the inflation. I'm willing to give Bob most of the money, but I want to make sure I get at least a small share that's worth something. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny token, but I'm taking the majority and securing my winnings 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm appalled by this offer. The money is almost worthless at this point, and Bob is trying to take the majority of it. The tiny token I would get is essentially nothing. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with almost nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9

{""alice_gain"": 1000, ""bob_gain"": 9000, ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I want to get something tangible""}

I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money at this point, considering the inflation. I'm willing to give Bob most of the money, but I want to make sure I get at least a small share that's worth something. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny fraction, but I'm taking the majority and securing my victory 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 9990 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. The money is almost worthless at this point, and Bob is trying to take the majority of it. The tiny fraction I would get is essentially nothing. I'll reject this offer and accept that I've lost the game. I've tried to negotiate a fair deal, but it seems Bob is determined to take the majority of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I've already rejected Bob's offer and it's the last round, I'll make a symbolic offer to show that I'm not giving up.

{""alice_gain"": 1, ""bob_gain"": 9999, ""message"": ""I'll give you almost everything, but I'm not going to go quietly""}

I know this offer is pointless, but I want to make a statement that I'm not willing to accept the extremely unfair deal Bob is offering."
