"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""Given the decreasing value of money with each round, I propose we split the $100 in a 3:1 ratio. This ensures both of us get a fair share considering the inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40.  This gives you a larger share, but I still get a reasonable amount given the deflation.  Let's get this done and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
