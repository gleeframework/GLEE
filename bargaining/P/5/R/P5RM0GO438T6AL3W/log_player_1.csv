"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Take it and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a fair share this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a bigger share this time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. With the money being worth 5% less, $4,000 is not as attractive as it was in the first round, and I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less again, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A fair share for both of us. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is a bit more than his previous offer, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said meet in the middle, but I think I can do better!

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take an even bigger share this time.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can still do better. The money is worth 14.26% less than it was in the first round, so $4,500 is not as attractive as it would have been earlier. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to protect my share.""

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take a larger share again.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can still do better. The money is worth 22.62% less than it was in the first round, so $3,000 is not as attractive as it would have been earlier. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50. It's the fairest way, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll try to squeeze out a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting aggressive with his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's extremely one-sided and I don't think it's fair. $1,000 is a tiny fraction of the original $10,000, and I'd be leaving with almost nothing. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my last chance, I'll take what I can get!

# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is making a final push for a large share of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's extremely one-sided and I'd be leaving with almost nothing. $500 is a tiny fraction of the original $10,000, and I'd be giving up a huge amount of value. I'd rather take a chance on making a better deal in the next round, even though it's my last chance."
