"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. Let's start with a fair split.""
}
```

This way, we both get a roughly equal share of the money, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still leaving you with a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd rather take the smaller amount now than risk waiting for a better offer and potentially getting even less in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
