"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 from the first round is now worth $5,400, and Bob's $4,000 is now worth $4,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to reject it since I can get more than $5,400.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 2, my $6,000 was worth $5,400, and now due to another 10% inflation, it's worth $4,860. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the current value of the money:

Initially, $6,000 was worth $6,000. After 3 rounds of 10% inflation, it's worth $4,860. After another 10% inflation, it's worth $4,860 * 0.9 = $4,386. 

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the value of the money in the first round:

$6,000 was worth $6,000, and $4,000 was worth $4,000. After 2 rounds of inflation (10% and 5%), $4,000 is worth $4,000 * 0.95 = $3,800. After another 14.26% inflation, it's worth $3,800 * 0.8554 = $3,245.32.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer since it's better than my current situation.
