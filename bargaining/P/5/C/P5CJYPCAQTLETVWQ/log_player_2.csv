Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is running out. Accepting this offer would give me a very marginal gain over her previous offer.  I need to incentivize her to make a significant move towards a more favorable outcome for me before the money loses too much value for her."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 53,
""alice_gain"": 47,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this soon.  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm serious about reaching a deal. This is a good offer considering the shrinking pot."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is on. Alice needs to understand that waiting any longer significantly hurts her potential gain.
* **Slight Increase:** By increasing the offer slightly, I signal a willingness to compromise, but also firmness in my position. 
* **Highlighting Loss:** Reminding Alice about the shrinking pot emphasizes the cost of not accepting a deal."
