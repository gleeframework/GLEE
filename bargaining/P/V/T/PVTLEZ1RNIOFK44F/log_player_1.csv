"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, but I'm not going for 60-40! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $2,400. Bob's gain of $7,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $6,650.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
