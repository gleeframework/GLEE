"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even distribution of the initial $1,000,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I don't think I can afford to give up 70% of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than the original $1,000,000, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting all the marbles, Bob. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers. Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm still getting the better end of the deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out! With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original $1,000,000, I need to think carefully about this offer. However, I don't think I can afford to give up 55% of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now! I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""It's time to split it down the middle, Bob. No more playing games.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair distribution of the remaining value. Let's see if Bob will finally agree!"
