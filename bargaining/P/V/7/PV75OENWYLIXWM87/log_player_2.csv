Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 55-45, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  I'll accept Alice's offer."
