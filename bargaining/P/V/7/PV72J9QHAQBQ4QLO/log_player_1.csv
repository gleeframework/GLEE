"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game over with!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty lopsided offer from Bob! I'm not happy about giving up 80% of the money. I'll reject his offer and try to make a better one in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was quite biased towards him, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'm still giving Bob a decent share, but I'm getting a bit more than before. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm not going to let Bob walk all over me! Since he's been making offers that are increasingly biased towards himself, I'll try to make an offer that's a bit more aggressive. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I'm taking a bit more control of the negotiation and trying to get a better deal for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10

Round 7

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm not going to let Bob get away with his outrageous offers! Since he's been making increasingly extreme offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer that takes into account the fact that he's been trying to take advantage of me. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","Are you kidding me?! Bob's offer is completely ridiculous! He's trying to take 98% of the money and leave me with a paltry 2%! That's not a negotiation, that's a joke! I'm not going to accept an offer that's so one-sided and unfair. I'll reject his offer and try to make a better one in the next round.

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm not going to let Bob get away with his outrageous offers! Since he's been making increasingly extreme offers, I'll try to make a final offer that's in my favor. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10
}
```

This way, I'm taking a large majority of the money, but still giving Bob a small chance to get something. I'm hoping he'll accept this one and we can finally end the game.

(This is my last chance to make an offer, so I'm going all in!)"

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","NO WAY! Bob's offer is completely unacceptable! He's trying to take 99% of the money and leave me with a mere 1%! That's not a negotiation, that's a robbery! I refuse to accept such an unfair offer.

Since I've rejected his offer, I'll make a final response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This means that neither of us will get anything, as we've reached the maximum number of rounds without reaching an agreement."
