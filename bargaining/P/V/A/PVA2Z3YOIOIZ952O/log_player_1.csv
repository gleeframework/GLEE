"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, and I'll take the remaining $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth $7,200 (10% less). 

Considering Bob's offer, I'll get $1,000, which is still worth the same as in the first round, but I'd rather have more considering the inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, my $7,200 from the previous round is now worth $6,480 (10% less). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
