Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 60% to 40%, I'll offer a slightly more favorable split to Bob:

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000

Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth significantly less for Bob, I'll try to take a bit more to compensate for the loss of value. However, I don't want to give up too much, so I'll stick with a slightly higher amount for myself:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, taking into account the fact that the money is worth less for Bob. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, I'll offer a larger share to myself:

  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
