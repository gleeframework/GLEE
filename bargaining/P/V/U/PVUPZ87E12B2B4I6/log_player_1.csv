"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This means I'll take $8,000 and Bob will take $2,000. It's a pretty generous offer, considering the money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
