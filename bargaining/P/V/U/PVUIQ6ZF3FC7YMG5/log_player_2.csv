Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting worse for me due to inflation, Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting now would mean losing a significant portion of the potential gains, even considering the inflation."

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me.  While this offer isn't great, it's better than getting nothing if Alice continues to be stubborn and I have to accept an even worse deal later or get nothing at all."
