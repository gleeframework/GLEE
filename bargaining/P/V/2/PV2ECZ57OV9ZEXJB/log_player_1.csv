"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with only $1. This is a very aggressive move, but I am hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of inflation affecting his share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. While it is a significant improvement from the previous round, I am still confident I can get a better deal. Inflation will impact Bob's gains more significantly in future rounds, and I will be able to leverage that to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose an 80/20 split in my favor.  Bob's gains have been further diminished by inflation, making him more likely to accept a less favorable offer than before."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While Bob's gains are heavily impacted by inflation, I still believe I can secure a better deal. The 450,000 offer is less than what I offered in the previous round.  I'm confident I can push for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. Bob's gains are significantly impacted by inflation, and this offer is still much better than the previous round. I'm confident he will accept this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Despite the lower than expected offer, Bob's gains have been heavily impacted by inflation.  I accept the 300,000 offer as it is better than what I could potentially get in future rounds."
