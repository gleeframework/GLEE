"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! This offer gives you a decent share and saves us both from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""My turn! Let's split the difference a bit more this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a fair offer, and it's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing later. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. This offer is fair and time is running out. ""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm holding firm, but every round is costing you. Take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on and the offer isn't terrible, I need to hold my ground a little longer. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain due to inflation. Alice might be getting impatient, which could lead to a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to play hardball.  

* **Urgency:**  We are past the halfway point, and the inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair, and Alice can't argue against that without seeming greedy.
* **Risk:** There's a risk Alice might reject this, but the potential loss from further inflation is too great. This offer forces her to make a decision â€“ accept a fair deal or risk getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're running out of time.  That 'final offer' was laughable. This is my final offer - take it before inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

I have to be realistic. Alice is holding strong, and my bargaining position is getting weaker with every passing round. 

* **Significant Loss:**  The inflation is brutal. Rejecting this offer and getting nothing in the end would be a worse outcome than taking the 40% now. 
* **Alice's Resolve:**  Her ""final offer"" comment and the fact that she hasn't budged much suggests she's willing to risk it all. 

It's painful, but it's the best move in this situation."
