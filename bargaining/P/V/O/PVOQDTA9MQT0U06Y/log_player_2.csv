"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. 60/40 seems like a reasonable split to me.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is going nowhere. Let's be realistic - 55/45 is a decent compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
