"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting that we can discuss and potentially adjust the split to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Since the money is worth 20% less than before, the actual values are:

* My gain: $300,000 x 0.8 = $240,000
* Bob's gain: $700,000 x 0.8 = $560,000

Given the significant difference in the proposed split, I'm not thrilled about accepting this offer. I'd like to try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think this is a more reasonable split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split, but still slightly in my favor. The message is a gentle nudge, suggesting that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I'm being generous considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to recalculate the actual values:

* My gain: $450,000 x 0.512 (48.8% of original value) = $229,200
* Bob's gain: $550,000 x 0.512 (48.8% of original value) = $281,600

I'm still not thrilled about the split, but I'm getting closer to accepting an offer. I'll consider this one.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
