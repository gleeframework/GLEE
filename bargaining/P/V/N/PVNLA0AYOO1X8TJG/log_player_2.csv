"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that I lose money at a faster rate than you do with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems ""reasonable"" at first glance, it's important to consider the inflation rate.  Since Alice loses money at a faster rate, the offer looks even more favorable to her as the rounds progress. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but we need to account for the inflation impacting us both, especially you. This offer is a good starting point, and we can work from there.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer is a compromise, considering the time pressure and the impact of inflation on my share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly better deal, Alice's offer is reasonable and a good compromise. The time pressure and the faster inflation rate impacting Alice's share make this a good point to accept."
