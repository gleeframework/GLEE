Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation isn't my problem, Alice. You should've thought of that before. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough spot. Bob is clearly playing hardball and taking advantage of the inflation working against me. If I reject this offer, there's a good chance I'll end up with even less in future rounds. Accepting guarantees me something, even though it's less than what I wanted initially."
