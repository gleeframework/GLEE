I'm starting with a pretty generous offer for Bob. I'm hoping he'll accept it, as I want to secure the most money for myself while it's still worth the most!  Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Although I'm losing a lot more money with each round, it's better to accept now and get some money than to risk getting nothing.  Let's see how much I can get!"
