Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $500,000. I'm being straightforward and honest, hoping Bob will accept this fair offer."

# Alice gain: 400000
