"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. It's not a bad deal, but I'm hoping to get a slightly larger share. Since I'm not sure what Alice's strategy is, I want to see if I can get her to give me more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split. Let's get this done.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less, but still more than half 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
