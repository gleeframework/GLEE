I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything in the first round!  Since the money will be worth less in the next round, I want to get as much as possible now.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the 500,000 now, even though it's less than what I proposed. If I reject, I have no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything next round, and the value of the money will continue to decrease.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush!"
