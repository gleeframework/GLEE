"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $70, you take $30. It's a good deal for you in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 40,
""alice_gain"": 60,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too greedy Alice. Let's be reasonable, I'll take $40 and you take $60.  The value decreases rapidly with each round, so don't wait too long!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again. I'll take $65, and you get $35.  This is a better deal than you'll get in later rounds, trust me. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is still trying to take a large share, and while the deal is slightly better, it's not in my best interest. The longer the game goes on, the more desperate Alice will become.  I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Alice, it's time to get serious.  The clock is ticking, and we're both losing money. I'll take $45, you take $55.  It's a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! My final offer: $60 for me, $40 for you.  Let's close this deal before the money loses all its value! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, this is the best offer I'm likely to get at this point. The inflation is eating away at the value quickly. Accepting $40 now is better than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing in later rounds."
