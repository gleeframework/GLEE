"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. I'll take almost everything, but I'll give him $1 just to be nice. This way, if he rejects my offer, he'll be in a much worse position in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob's offer is fair and I'm not sure I can do better in the next round, given the inflation penalty. It's better to take what's on the table."
