"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you get 40%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair starting point.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to be the big winner, huh? Okay, I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept a 60-40 split in his favor, especially when I was willing to offer him 40% in the first round! Now it's my turn to make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll take 55% and you get 45%. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where we can both be happy with the deal."
