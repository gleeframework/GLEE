Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable. This is a good offer, take it while it lasts. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! Here's my next offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's split this evenly.  It's clear we both want a larger share, but this back and forth is pointless. Take the fair deal before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is already worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and considering the risk of further inflation, I think it's wise to take the fair deal now and avoid potential losses."
