"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the money loses value over time. I'll attach a friendly message to set a positive tone for our negotiation. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, take it or lose out next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is losing value, I believe I can get a better deal. Bob's message tries to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not intimidated. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Don't be too greedy.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll increase my proposed share to 650,000, considering the money's decreasing value. My message to Bob cautions him against being too greedy, implying that his previous offer was unreasonable. I'm trying to create a sense of balance in the negotiation while still pushing for a favorable outcome. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think Bob's offer is reasonable at this point. The difference between our proposed shares is relatively small, and further negotiation may lead to even greater losses due to inflation. Bob's message suggests that this is his final offer, and I'm inclined to believe him. I'll accept this offer to secure a decent share of the money before it loses even more value. Time to end the game!"
