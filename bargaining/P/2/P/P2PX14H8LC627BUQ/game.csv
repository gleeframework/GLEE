6000.0,4000.0,I propose we start with a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems fair considering the faster rate of inflation on my end.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the inflation rate, I think 55/45 is a fairer split.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate your consideration of the inflation, I believe a more equitable split is still possible. Let's continue negotiating.",Alice,2,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Okay, Bob, here's a counter-offer. I'm willing to compromise a bit, but the faster inflation rate needs to be factored in. Let's do 56/44.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4750.0,5250.0,Let's meet in the middle. 52.5/47.5 seems like a good compromise considering the inflation rates.,Bob,4,
,,"This split still disproportionately favors you, Bob.  I'm willing to be reasonable, but the deal needs to reflect the reality of our situation.",Alice,4,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, time is running out.  I'm proposing 54/46.  This is a serious offer and takes both our inflation rates into account. Let's close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
