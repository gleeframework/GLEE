"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair division. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can always adjust it later! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a fair division is tempting, it's risky to accept such a lopsided deal in the first round. There are 12 rounds, and the value of money decreases with each passing round. It's better to see if Alice is willing to offer a more balanced split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 5000,

""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 50/50.  We can adjust later if we need to, but this feels like a good starting point.""
