  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can be done!""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll try to negotiate further."

}
```

I'll try to make one last proposal, hoping Bob will finally accept a reasonable offer."

# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting ridiculous! Bob's offer is insulting, and the value of the money is decreasing so rapidly that I'm not even sure it's worth considering. However, I'll have to think about it carefully. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, but I'm doing it with great reluctance. I'm not happy about the tiny share I'm getting, but I don't see any other way to end this game."
