**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her due to inflation.  I'm willing to push my luck a bit further to see if I can get an even better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd rather get something than nothing. Last chance for a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning. While my offers are holding steady, Alice's are becoming heavily impacted by inflation.  She's clearly feeling the pressure and is willing to accept a smaller percentage to avoid walking away with nothing.  While I might be able to push for a bit more in the next round or two, there's a growing risk that Alice will start making desperate lowball offers, and I'd rather take a decent deal now than risk ending up with nothing."
