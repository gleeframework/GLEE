"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gets us both a good chunk of money. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I think we can find a better division. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that I think is more reasonable. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to find a middle ground that benefits both of us. Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid further losses due to inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the most generous you'll get. Let's not drag this out and lose more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the money is worth less with each passing round, I still believe we can find a better division. Alice's offer is only slightly better than the initial one, and I'm willing to take the risk to see if we can find a more mutually beneficial agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. I'll try to find a compromise that is more favorable to both of us. Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 42,
""alice_gain"": 58,
""message"": ""Alice, let's not lose more to inflation. This offer is a good middle ground, and we can both walk away with a reasonable share. It's better to settle now rather than risk losing more value in the next rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need you to meet me halfway. This offer is a good compromise, and the longer we wait, the less we both get. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the money is worth significantly less now, I still think Alice's offer is not fair. I've made concessions in my previous offers, and I expect Alice to do the same. I'll reject this offer and see if we can find a better agreement in the next round. The pressure of the decreasing value of the money might prompt Alice to be more flexible in her next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, considering the significant decrease in the value of the money. I'll try to find a compromise that takes into account the losses we've both incurred due to inflation. Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing a substantial amount to inflation. I think it's time for us to meet in the middle and settle on a division that reflects the current situation. This offer is a fair compromise, considering the losses we've both incurred.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of your stubbornness.  Accept this reasonable offer and let's be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I think Alice's offer is reasonable at this point. We've both lost a substantial amount to inflation, and it's time to settle on a division that reflects the current situation. While I had hoped for a more favorable outcome, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision to minimize further losses."
