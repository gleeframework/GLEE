"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small chunk to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I'm hoping for a better deal next time! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is worth $180,000 now.

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's a very lopsided split in Bob's favor. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my gain of $200,000 is now worth $180,000, and the total amount is worth 90% of what it was in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split it 60-40.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $600,000 is now worth $436,400 (since 100,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 72900 * 6 = 437400, then 437400 * 0.971 = 424,100, but I'll just use 436400 for simplicity).

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's still a relatively even split, but I'm not getting the majority of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth $363,600.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, Bob, but I'm not going to give up much more than that. Let's try to wrap this up.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in, Alice. Let's meet in the middle and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $700,000 is now worth $415,100 (since 700,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 510,300, then 510,300 * 0.59 = 301,577, but I'll just use 415,100 for simplicity).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, as it's an even split, but I'm not getting a better deal than this. Considering the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money, I'm willing to accept this offer to get some cash in hand.
