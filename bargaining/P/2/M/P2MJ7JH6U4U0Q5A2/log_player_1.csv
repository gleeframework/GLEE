"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40 to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. This leaves me with $60. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting that we can reassess the split later if needed."
