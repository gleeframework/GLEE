I'm going to start with a very unfair offer, giving myself almost everything. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm trying to secure the largest possible portion before it has any significant impact."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money, and the inflation doesn't seem to be affecting me negatively in this round.  It's a good deal compared to risking getting even less in the next round."
