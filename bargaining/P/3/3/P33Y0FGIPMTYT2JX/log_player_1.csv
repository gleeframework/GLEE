I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is being greedy! He's taking almost all the money. I'm not going to accept this offer. I'll make my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a more even split this time.  With inflation, things are getting more serious.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."
