"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial amount, which is $200,000. This leaves me with $800,000, which I think is a fair share considering the risks and uncertainties of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a good one. I'll accept it.
