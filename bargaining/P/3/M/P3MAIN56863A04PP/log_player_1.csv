"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less, so I'll get $4,000 instead of $4,500. Bob's offer is still a bit biased towards him, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer for now and wait for a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable deal for myself this time, but still leaving room for negotiation. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving in yet! You're still being too generous! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! In this round, the money is worth 27.1% less than the original $10,000, so I'll get $3,500.

Bob's offer is still biased towards him, but I'll consider it. However, I'm not willing to give up more than 35% of the total, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth 27.1% less than the original $10,000, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing your luck, Bob! I'm not going to give up more than 42%.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous deal for myself, but still trying to keep the negotiation going. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down! You're still giving me too much! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really eating away at the money's value! In this round, the money is worth 40.95% less than the original $10,000, so I'll get $3,000.

Bob's offer is still biased towards him, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll have to make a tough decision. Considering the dwindling value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
