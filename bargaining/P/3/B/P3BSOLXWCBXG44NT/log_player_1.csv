```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap things up quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than before, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'd like a bit more myself.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains! With my gain worth 27.1% less than the original, I need to be careful with my next move.

I'll reject this offer, as it's still not favorable enough for me. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really affecting my potential gains now, so I need to be strategic. Since Bob's previous offer was 65-35 in his favor, I'll try to push for a more even split. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too.""
