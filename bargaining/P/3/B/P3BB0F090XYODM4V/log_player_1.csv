Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
