"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a small share""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual values are:
Alice gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
Bob gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40

I accept Bob's offer:
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
