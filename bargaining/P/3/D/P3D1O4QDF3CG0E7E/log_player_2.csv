{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Your offer was reasonable for the first round, Alice.  However, the value of the money decreases faster for me than for you, so I propose a 60/40 split in my favor for this round.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about the decreasing value of the money, Bob.  But, let's try to find a more balanced split.  I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor, which still accounts for your higher inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
