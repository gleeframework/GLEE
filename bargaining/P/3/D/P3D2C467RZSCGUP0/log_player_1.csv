"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small portion of the money to start, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give it away too easily. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too low for me, Bob. I'm hoping for a better deal.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will make a more generous offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not pushing Bob too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 50/50, but I'm not going to give you a better deal than that. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if 50/50 is the best I can get, but it's a decent offer. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 5000 / (1 - 0.1426) ≈ 5,813
Bob gain: 5000 / (1 - 0.271) ≈ 6,667

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is inflated, but I'll take the offer to avoid risking a worse deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, 50/50 it is. Let's call it a day.""
}
```"
