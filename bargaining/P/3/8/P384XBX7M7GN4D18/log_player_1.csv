"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very greedy strategy in the first round. I'll offer Bob a single dollar, hoping he'll accept it since it's a small amount. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has devalued my potential earnings, Bob's offer is still a significant amount. I'll accept it, as I don't want to risk losing even more money in future rounds."
