"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep 90$ for myself and give Bob 10$. This seems like a fair starting point, as I am taking the majority, but still offering Bob a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, Bob's offer is much better than the outcome of the previous round. It's worth noting that the 5% inflation on my end is much less than the 20% inflation on Bob's side."
