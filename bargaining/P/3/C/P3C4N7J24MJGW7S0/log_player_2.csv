"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small amount and we can be done with this.  
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try to get a better offer. The current offer of $100,000 is too low, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to potentially get a larger share.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is more reasonable, considering the decreasing value of the money.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 45% for me is a good starting point.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. We both know the money is losing value with each round. This is a fair split that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of the money, Alice's offer of $400,000 is reasonable, and I think it's better to accept it rather than risking another round with further inflation. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can conclude the game.\n\n###\n\nLet's finalize the agreement!"
