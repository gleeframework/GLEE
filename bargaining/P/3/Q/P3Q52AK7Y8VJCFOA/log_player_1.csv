"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to start, but I'm looking for a bigger share in the end.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is 10% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $9,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe in a fair division. Both of us should receive equal shares. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 90% of its original value, so the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 9000 * 0.9 = 8100
* Bob's gain: 1000

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 5000
* Bob's gain: 5000

Since my gain in this offer is less than what I would get in the previous round, and considering the inflation, I'll accept Bob's offer.
