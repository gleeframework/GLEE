"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40% to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's fair in the current round, I know that Alice's share will decrease by 5% each round, while mine will stay the same. By rejecting, I can potentially get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm going to propose a fairer split that gives you a bit less now, but will be more beneficial for you in the long run as we continue. Let's work together to get the most out of this game.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is a good compromise considering the time pressure and inflation. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me something.  With each round, the risk of getting nothing increases, so it's best to secure a decent amount."
