Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer,  hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer in round 2.  The money is losing value quickly, and this ensures I get at least half of the remaining value.  It's a good starting point for negotiation."
