Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'll be getting 70 dollars, which is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob will get 30 dollars, which is 20% less than the 37.5 dollars he would have gotten in the first round.

I'll consider this offer and decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."

}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is 20% less than the 50 dollars he would have gotten in the first round, and I'll take 60 dollars, which is worth the same as in the first round. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
