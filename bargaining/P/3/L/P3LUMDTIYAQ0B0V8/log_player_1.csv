"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I need a bit more since the money doesn't lose value for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is a fair deal, Bob. I'm losing money with each round, and this is the last time I'll accept a 50/50 split.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your last 50/50 offer, so I'll take a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on with dwindling rounds, accepting this offer would set a bad precedent and likely lead to Bob proposing increasingly worse deals.  I'm aiming to solidify a pattern of rejecting offers where I get significantly less than half after accounting for inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. It's more than you've offered, and the clock is ticking for both of us."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm applying pressure by presenting this as my ""final offer."" While it leans slightly in Bob's favor pre-inflation, it's a significant concession from my previous 50/50 stance. This offer attempts to balance getting a reasonable share with the urgency of the dwindling rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not convinced. The inflation is affecting you, not me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation and the 'final offer' tactic didn't work as intended.  Accepting this would be disastrous; it's better to hold out hope for a less imbalanced deal in the remaining rounds.  I need to show Bob I'm serious about walking away from a bad deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4700,
""bob_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We both lose if this fails. This is my absolute last offer. Take it or leave it."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Urgency:**  With only six rounds remaining, the message needs to convey extreme urgency. Bob needs to understand that time is running out for both of us.
* **Slight Concession:**  I'm offering slightly more than Bob's last offer but less than my ""final offer"" in Round 5. This shows I'm willing to negotiate under the extreme time pressure but not capitulate.
* **Strong Language:** Using terms like ""ridiculous"" and ""absolute last offer"" are meant to shake Bob's confidence that I'll keep negotiating as the rounds dwindle.

This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  It's possible Bob will call my bluff, but it's also possible this strong stance will make him realize he needs to take a reasonable deal now before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not buying the 'absolute last offer' threat. You're losing value with each round, I'm not. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

This is a tough decision, but Bob is clearly calling my bluff and becoming more aggressive. Here's why it's time to cut my losses:

* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively worse. If he rejected my ""absolute last offer,"" it's highly unlikely he'll suddenly offer something more favorable in the remaining rounds.
* **Inflation Impact:** The longer this drags on, the more I lose to inflation. While $3,800 is a significant loss from my initial goal, it's better than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing at all if we reach round 12.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob is banking on my fear of losing everything. Accepting this offer, while not ideal, disrupts his expectation that I'll keep folding under pressure.

This situation highlights how vital a strong opening offer and consistent negotiation strategy are in such games."
