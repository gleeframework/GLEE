Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, think carefully! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but I still have time.  While the inflation is hurting, accepting an offer where I get significantly less than Alice is not a good strategy. I need to show I'm willing to risk it going down to the wire to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Okay, let's be realistic.  This is a decent compromise. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming a factor now. I need to make a move that shows I'm willing to negotiate but also won't accept a bad deal. This offer is still slightly in Alice's favor, but the inflation means I'm losing ground rapidly. It's a risk, but hopefully, she sees it as a fair compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, don't be stubborn! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing in the later rounds.  Alice is clearly willing to wait me out, and I can't risk losing even more value."
