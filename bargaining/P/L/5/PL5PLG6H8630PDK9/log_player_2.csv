Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was too greedy considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle - 55/45. It's a good deal for both of us if we settle now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
