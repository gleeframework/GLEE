"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose taking 900,000$ for myself and giving 100,000$ to Bob.  This way, I get the majority of the money, but I'm also showing some fairness by giving Bob a small portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I propose taking 600,000$ for myself and giving 400,000$ to Bob. Since Bob rejected my first offer, I'm adjusting my proposal to be more balanced. While I still want a larger share, this offer recognizes that Bob also has bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, I have to consider the inflation and the fact that each round is getting worse for me.  It's better to accept 300,000 than risk getting nothing at all."
