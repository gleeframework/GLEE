Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a generous offer right off the bat. ðŸ˜Š"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject the offer. While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, remember that inflation is affecting me, not Bob. I'm losing 20% of the value of my share with each passing round.  I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm lowering my demand slightly to account for the potential risk of going further down the road and facing even steeper inflation. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting the offer.  Even though Bob is now taking a larger share, the inflation is hitting me hard. I'm losing almost half the value of my money with each round. I'm hoping for a more equitable split that takes this into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher share for Bob, hoping he sees the value in settling before inflation further erodes the value of my share.  I'm willing to compromise but still need to secure a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous! The inflation is really biting into my potential gains. I'm still rejecting the offer. While I understand Bob is now taking a significant majority, I'm not going to cave to his demands just yet. I'll continue to try and negotiate a more fair split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm raising my offer again, but I'm really feeling the pressure of inflation. This is a risky move, but I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in settling before things get even worse for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting increasingly frustrating! The inflation is seriously impacting my potential share, and Bob seems determined to take advantage of the situation. I'm still rejecting the offer.  The stakes are high now, but I'm not going to give in completely. I'll keep trying to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This is getting desperate. I'm offering a 50/50 split to try and salvage something.  The inflation is brutal, and I'm losing a huge amount of value with each round.  Hopefully, Bob realizes we're both losing out if this keeps going and agrees to this."
