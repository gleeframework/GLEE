"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll get 500000 * 0.95 = 475000, and Bob will get 500000 * 0.8 = 400000.

I accept this offer.
