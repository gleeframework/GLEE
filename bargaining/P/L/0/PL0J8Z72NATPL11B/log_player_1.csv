"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a fair share, and I'll take the remaining $900,000. Let's hope he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, considering the initial offer was unfair 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take Bob's offer. The money is worth less after inflation, so I'll take the $600,000. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
