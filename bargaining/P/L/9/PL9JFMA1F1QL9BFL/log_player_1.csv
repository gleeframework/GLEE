"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 80% and you can take 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide it equally, each receiving $500,000. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain would be worth 80% of the original amount, so I'd be getting 800,000 * 0.8 = 640,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation. If we divide it equally, I'd be getting 500,000, which is less than what I'd get in the first round.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain would be worth 64% of the original amount (80% * 0.8), so I'd be getting 640,000 * 0.64 = 409,600.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation""
}
```"
