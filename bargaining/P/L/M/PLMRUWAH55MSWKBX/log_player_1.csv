I propose taking $9,000 and giving Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is more generous than my initial proposal, it is still far too unfavorable given the potential for inflation. I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm willing to lower my share slightly to $8,000, giving Bob $2,000. I'm hoping this will encourage him to reach a compromise before we lose more money to inflation."
