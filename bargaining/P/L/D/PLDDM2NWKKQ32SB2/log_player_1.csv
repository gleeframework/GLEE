"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose keeping 90% of the money for myself and giving Bob 10%.  I'm hoping he'll accept this, as it's a good starting point and leaves him with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm offering Bob 15% of the money, which is 5% more than he offered me in the previous round.  This is still a good deal for me considering the inflation, and I hope he'll see it that way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm offering Bob 25% of the money, which is a slight increase from his previous offer.  I'm hoping this is enough to incentivize him to accept, as the inflation is starting to impact me significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is taking a toll, I'm still not ready to settle for 60%. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll continue to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm offering Bob 35% of the money, which is a slight increase from his previous offer.  I'm trying to find a balance between my own losses due to inflation and the need to incentivize Bob to accept.  Let's see how this goes."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is seriously impacting me now. Accepting a 50/50 split is the best I can do at this point. I'm taking a significant loss, but at least I'm getting something."
