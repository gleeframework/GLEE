"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, a fair trade for my 60. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think this offer is fair for me. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```

  ""message"": ""I'll take 45, a good compromise""
