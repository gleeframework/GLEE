Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take 9000 dollars and give Bob 1000 dollars. This way I get the majority of the money while still leaving a small amount for Bob to potentially accept. I'm hoping to end the game quickly, as the longer it goes on, the less money we both get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Although Bob is taking a larger share, it's still a significant amount of money. Given the inflation, waiting for another round risks getting even less. It's better to accept and secure this amount."
