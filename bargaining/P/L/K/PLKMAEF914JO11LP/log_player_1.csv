"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment... 

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. In the first round, I was hoping for $6,000, but now it's worth only $5,700.

Bob's offer of $5,000 is actually a decent compromise, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and the continued erosion of the money's value.
