"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can start the negotiations from a reasonable position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 50/50. I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in Round 3. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted 50/50, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable and leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is eating away at our potential earnings!

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than 40%. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot where I get a decent share, but still leave room for Bob to feel like he's getting a fair deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. This is my last offer 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on our potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I'm running out of room to negotiate. I'm not thrilled about the 3000, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer and hope it's the best I can get.
