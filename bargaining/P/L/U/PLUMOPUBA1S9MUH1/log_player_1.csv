"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

This is a straightforward 50/50 split, leaving no room for further negotiation. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm the one who's more deserving of the majority 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob thinks he's the more deserving one!

I'll reject this offer since it's not even close to a fair split. I think I deserve a bigger share, considering I'm the one making the proposal this round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I'm still the one who deserves more.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny share, but I'm the one who's really driving this negotiation 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to squeeze me out!

I'll reject this offer as well. A 10% share is not even close to a fair deal, and I'm not willing to accept such a small amount. I think I deserve more than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, I'm the one who's really driving this negotiation.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 85/15 split in my favor. I'm trying to take a firmer stance and show Bob that I'm not willing to back down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is still trying to hold on to the majority of the money!

I'll reject this offer as well. A 20% share is still a relatively small amount, and I think I deserve more. I'm not willing to accept a deal that leaves me with such a small portion of the $1,000,000.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. It's time to make a serious offer.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm trying to make a strong push for a larger share of the money, and I'm giving Bob a small chance to salvage something. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give up yet 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is still holding on to his optimism!

I'll reject this offer as well. A 40% share is a bit more than I was willing to accept in previous rounds, but I still think I deserve more. I'm not going to give up yet, and I'm hoping to get an even better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 950000,
  ""bob_gain"": 50000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. This is my final offer.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 95/5 split in my favor. I'm making a strong push for the majority of the money, and I'm giving Bob a tiny chance to salvage a small share. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give up yet 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make a last-ditch effort!

I'll reject this offer as well. A 60% share is still a decent amount, but I was hoping to get an even better deal. I'm not going to accept a split that leaves me with less than 60% of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 990000,
  ""bob_gain"": 10000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final, final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 99/1 split in my favor. I'm making a strong push for the majority of the money, and I'm leaving Bob with a tiny share. It's a take-it-or-leave-it offer, and I'm hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd rather have nothing than accept this insult 
# Alice gain: 1000000 
# Bob gain: 0 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make a point!

I'll accept this offer. Since we've reached the 12th round, and neither of us has accepted a deal, I'll take the 1,000,000$ and leave Bob with nothing. It's not the most ideal outcome, but it's better than walking away with nothing.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
