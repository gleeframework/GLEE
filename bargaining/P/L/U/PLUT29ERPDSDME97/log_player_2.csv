**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation and the shrinking pot. While time is running out, accepting a deal where I consistently get significantly less is not in my best interest. There's a chance Alice panics in later rounds and offers a more even split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 505000,
""alice_gain"": 495000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm offering a very fair split. If you reject this, we're both losing out significantly. Take the deal!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Advantage:** Maintaining a slight advantage for myself while inching closer to a 50/50 split.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the urgency of the situation and the potential loss for both parties if a deal isn't reached soon. This might pressure Alice to accept. 
* **Future Leverage:** By consistently offering slightly better deals than Alice, I'm establishing a pattern of fairness and putting pressure on her to accept before the offers get worse for her."
