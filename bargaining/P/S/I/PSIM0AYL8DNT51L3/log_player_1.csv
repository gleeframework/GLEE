Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a terrible deal for me! Let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Take it now, because the value decreases significantly for you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
