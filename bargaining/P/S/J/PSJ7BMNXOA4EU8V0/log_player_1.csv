"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable to start with."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. A 60/40 split in favor of Bob seems a bit too skewed, but I don't want to risk losing out on a significant amount of money. I'll decide to reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a better deal this time. Here's my offer:

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which I hope will be more appealing to Bob."
