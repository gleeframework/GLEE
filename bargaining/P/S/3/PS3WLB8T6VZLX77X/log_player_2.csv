"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical, Bob. Take this offer before inflation eats away at your potential gains! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept such a low offer, especially considering that inflation will reduce the value of my gain over time. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've rejected her offer and it's my turn now.\n\nMy offer will be:\n\n# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, Alice! How about we split it more fairly?\n# Bob gain: 45\n# Alice gain: 55\n\nLet me know if Alice accepts or rejects my offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that, Alice! How about we split it more fairly?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is working against you. Let's be reasonable - this is a good deal for you while it lasts. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although inflation is reducing the value of my potential gains, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. With each passing round, Alice's offers aren't improving significantly enough for me to accept, considering the initial imbalance.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've rejected her offer again, and it's my turn now.\n\nMy offer will be:\n\n# Bob's message: Alice, your offers aren't adjusting for the fact that I'm losing value each round. Let's find a middle ground that respects the decreasing value for me.\n# Bob gain: 42\n# Alice gain: 58\n\nLet me know if Alice accepts or rejects my offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
