"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, Alice! How about we split it more fairly? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, inflation is working against you. Let's be reasonable - this is a good deal for you while it lasts.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offers aren't adjusting for the fact that I'm losing value each round. Let's find a middle ground that respects the decreasing value for me. 
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob is right that his potential gains are shrinking each round. Accepting 58 dollars now is better than risking an even lower offer from him in round 5.  It's important to adjust to the changing circumstances and secure a reasonable gain while I can."
