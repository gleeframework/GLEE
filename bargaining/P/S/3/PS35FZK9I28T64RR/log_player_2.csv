"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but I'm sure you'll get a better deal in the future. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. The longer this goes on, the less we both get.  This is a generous offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob, but I won't be taken advantage of. This is a fair split given the current circumstances. Let's not let the dwindling money dictate our decisions. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting her more than me, so she's feeling the pressure. I think I can get a better deal by continuing to play hardball."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, this offer is more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's be sensible and close this deal now before we both lose out.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's be reasonable and split the remaining value evenly. It's the best we can do at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I was hoping for a slightly better deal, Alice is right.  The inflation is eating away at the value, and an even split at this stage is better than risking getting nothing at all if we both continue to play hardball."
