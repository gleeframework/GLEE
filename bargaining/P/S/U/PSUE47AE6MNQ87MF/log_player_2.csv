"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm confident we can reach a more mutually beneficial outcome in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer!  While Alice is losing value on the money faster than me, I'm confident I can get a much better deal than that. Let's see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That first offer was insulting, Alice.  Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is your chance to get a decent chunk before inflation eats away at your potential gains.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for a larger share, Bob, but I'm willing to compromise.  This offer is still fair considering the inflation, and gives us both a decent amount.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to make me panic, but I'm not biting. Her offer is slightly better, but it's clear the inflation is hurting her more than me. I need to hold out for a much larger share, she'll be getting desperate soon enough."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to meet you halfway with an even split.  This is the best we can do with the inflation, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally getting real. An even split is more than fair at this point, considering she's losing almost 60% of her potential gains each round.  It's time to take the deal and run before she changes her mind!"
