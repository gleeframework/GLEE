"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $450,000 is equivalent to $360,000 in the first round. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer.

After considering the reduced value of the money, I decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less in the third round, my gain of $450,000 is equivalent to $360,000 in the first round, which is now worth 80% of its original value. To account for the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This offer reflects a slightly more favorable split for me, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less in the fourth round, my gain of $400,000 is equivalent to $600,000 in the first round. This is a relatively fair offer, considering the reduced value of the money.

I decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
