Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair 50/50 split.  This ensures we both get a good starting point.  We can then negotiate from there if needed."
