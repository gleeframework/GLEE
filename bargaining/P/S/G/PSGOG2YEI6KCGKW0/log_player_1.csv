"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 70% and you take 30%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your 50/50 split, but I'm not sure how long we'll last at this rate. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if 50/50 is the best option for me. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd rather aim for a higher share. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, so I'll accept this offer.
