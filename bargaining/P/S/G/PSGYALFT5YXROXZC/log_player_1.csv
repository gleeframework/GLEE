"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 3:1 split. I propose we divide it 80/20 in my favor, taking into account the inflation. This way we both get a decent amount and can avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
