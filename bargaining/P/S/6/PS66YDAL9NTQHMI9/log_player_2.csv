"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Bob. This is to encourage fairness and ensure we both benefit from this game. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is generous, it's important to remember that the money is worth less with each passing round. By rejecting, Bob increases his chances of getting a larger share later on, especially if Alice is unaware of the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
