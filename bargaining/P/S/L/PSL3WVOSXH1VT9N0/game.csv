350000.0,650000.0,"I believe a 65-35 split is more fair, considering the inflation rates. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also aware of the time pressure.",Bob,2,

570000.0,430000.0,"I took into account your counteroffer, but I think a 57-43 split is more reasonable, given the increasing inflation impact on both of us. Let's settle on this before it's too late.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,I'm willing to go back to the 60-40 split from the first round.  We need to be realistic about the time pressure and the growing inflation. Let's find common ground and finish this.,Bob,4,
