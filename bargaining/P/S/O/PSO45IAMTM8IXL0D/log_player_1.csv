Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still being fair 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for more, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but not that much!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, but still trying to maintain a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the decreased value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, given the current state of the economy.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to prioritize my own gain at this point.""
}
```

I'm offering a more significant share to Bob, but I'm still trying to maintain a decent amount for myself."
