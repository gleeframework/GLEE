"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the initial amount, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and we can adjust later if needed. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the amount I would gain in this round is actually 80% of $500,000, which is $400,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
