"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This is a fair and generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it so we can avoid further rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to maximize my gain. Bob's offer is still 60, but it's worth less than 40 in the first round, so I'll reject it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation taking a bigger toll on my potential gain, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger bite out of my potential gain. Bob's offer is a bit more skewed towards him, but I'm not sure if I want to accept it. I'll think carefully...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation eating away at my potential gain, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{

}

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
