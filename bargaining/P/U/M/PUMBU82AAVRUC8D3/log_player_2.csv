"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a good chunk too. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""This is a fair and balanced offer.  Let's split the money close to 60/40 and end this quickly.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  I'm willing to give you more, but we need to get this done quickly before inflation eats away at everything. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still better than the 19% less I would get from my previous offer.  It's time to take what I can get!"
