"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'll think about it...

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800
}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still hoping to get a better deal."
