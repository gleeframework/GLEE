"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 60 is worth 5% less than my initial gain of 70. And Bob's gain of 40 is worth 10% less than his initial gain of 30.

I'll think about it... Since Bob's offer is still not very generous, I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the inflation effect.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob, so I'm taking a firmer stance""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80-20 split, which is a bit more in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up too much, but I'll try to find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my gains!

Let me calculate the actual value of the offer: my gain of 75 is worth 14.26% less than my initial gain of 70, which means it's equivalent to about 60.23. Bob's gain of 25 is worth 27.1% less than his initial gain of 30, which means it's equivalent to about 21.88.

Considering the equivalent values, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable than Bob's previous ones. I'll accept it.
