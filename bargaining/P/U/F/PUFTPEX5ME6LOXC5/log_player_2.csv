Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90%, and you can have 10%.  I'm sure we can find a better solution for both of us as we go along.

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, that initial offer was quite harsh! Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor this time.  Remember, time is money, and it's literally losing value with each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try to meet in the middle. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This gives you a significant increase from the last round and leaves more time for both of us to negotiate a more favorable deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting better, it's crucial to remember that time is working against me, not her. A 60/40 split heavily favors her in the long run. I need to push for a more agreeable split quickly."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is literally decreasing with each passing second.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair deal that gives us both a reasonable share before inflation eats away at the value any further.""}
