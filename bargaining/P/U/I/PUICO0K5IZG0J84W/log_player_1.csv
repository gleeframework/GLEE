"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm starting with a 50-50 split. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is biting, and my offer needs to adjust accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, taking a slightly larger share to account for the decreasing value of money."
