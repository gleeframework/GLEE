"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'm effectively getting 4500 * 0.9 = 4050.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll accept it for now.
