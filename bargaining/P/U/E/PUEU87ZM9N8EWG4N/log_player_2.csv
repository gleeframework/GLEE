"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it 60-40 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to try and get a better deal than 40%. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, 58-42 is a fair deal considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to eat away at the potential gains.  Accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing in the end."
