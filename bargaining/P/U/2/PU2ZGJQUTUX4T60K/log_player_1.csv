"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $3200 (80% of $4000) and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth $5700 (95% of $6000).

I'm not thrilled about the proposal, but it's a bit better than the previous one. I'll decide to reject this offer and make a counter proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 4200, I think that's a fairer split""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, now it's your turn to decide""
}
```

I'm sticking to my counter proposal from the previous round, hoping Bob will accept this time."
