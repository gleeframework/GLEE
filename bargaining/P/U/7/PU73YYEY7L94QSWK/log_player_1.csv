I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small amount, or if he's going to play it safe and hope for a better deal later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a much better deal than my initial offer. I'll take it!"
