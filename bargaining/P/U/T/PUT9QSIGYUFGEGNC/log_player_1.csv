# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation affects Bob's share significantly more, I'd be giving up too much value by accepting an even split. I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it - we're both losing out the longer this goes on. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Despite Bob's message claiming it's his final offer, I believe he's trying to create a sense of urgency. Given the significant impact of inflation on his share, I'm not willing to accept an offer that doesn't reflect the decreasing value of his portion. I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round."

At this point, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of Bob's share, so I'm not inclined to make a more generous offer. I'm calling Bob's bluff, as I believe he's more desperate to reach an agreement than I am. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
