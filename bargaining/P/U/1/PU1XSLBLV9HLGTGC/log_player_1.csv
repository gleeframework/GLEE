"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is 40% of the initial 100 dollars. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'm still getting 60 dollars if I reject this offer and make a new proposal.

However, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer this time, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. My decision is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
