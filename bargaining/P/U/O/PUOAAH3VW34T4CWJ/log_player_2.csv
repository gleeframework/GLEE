"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 70/30 split seems reasonable.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this. I'll take the same amount you offered me last round, but we'll switch places. It's a fair deal considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the time pressure against me. While I lose money due to inflation each round, getting less than half of the initial amount is a bad deal, especially when we're getting closer to the halfway point of the game.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a low offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the counter-offer, but let's find a middle ground. This split feels more balanced given the circumstances.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere fast.  60/40 is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing tough, but her ""final offer"" isn't tempting enough.  We're past the halfway point, meaning my bargaining power is theoretically decreasing, but I'm betting Alice is getting nervous too. Holding out a little longer might get me closer to a 50/50 split, even with the inflation working against me."

Round 6

{""bob_gain"": 500000,
