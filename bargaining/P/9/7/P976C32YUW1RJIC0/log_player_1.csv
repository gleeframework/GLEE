"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. A 50/50 split sounds reasonable, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, Bob. Consider it!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which I think is a bit more favorable to me given the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, Alice. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the reduced value, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. However, Bob's offer seems slightly more favorable to me than my previous offer. I'll consider it... but I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept it yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 62,
  ""bob_gain"": 38,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a better deal to make it worth my while!""
}
```

I'm offering a 62-38 split, which I think is a bit more favorable to me given the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get worried about the inflation, Alice. Can we find a better balance? 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the money's value! With the reduced value, I'm starting to get desperate. However, Bob's offer seems like a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer. I'll accept this one.
