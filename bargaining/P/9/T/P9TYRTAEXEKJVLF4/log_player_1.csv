"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair share, let's start with a good split""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This seems like a fair starting point to me, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to end the game here."
