Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor, reflecting the fact that I'm taking on more risk by rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
