Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see you're willing to negotiate.  Let's compromise. I'll take 55, you take 45.  We both get a bit less than we wanted, but it's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
