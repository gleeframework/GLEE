"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent starting point.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's a very small portion of the total.  Bob should try to get a bigger share, especially considering the money will be worth less in the next round.  Rejecting allows Bob to make the proposal next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be more equitable this time.  I propose a 40/60 split.  We both get a good chunk of the money, and we can move on to better things.""}
