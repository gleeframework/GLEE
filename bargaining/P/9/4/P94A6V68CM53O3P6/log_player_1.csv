Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This is a strong first offer, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. The inflation is a significant factor, and it's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will propose an even less favorable split in the next round. It's better to secure 8000 now, even with the reduced value due to inflation."
