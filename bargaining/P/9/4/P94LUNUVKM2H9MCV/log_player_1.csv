"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 999,000/1,000 split. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting anything at all, especially considering he has no risk of losing value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing at all. The inflation is a significant factor and my gain will keep decreasing with each round."
