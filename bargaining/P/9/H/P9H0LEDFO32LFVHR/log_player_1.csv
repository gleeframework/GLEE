"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice. But I think a 55/45 split in my favor is a more balanced starting point.  After all, I get to propose this round. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a slight concession on my part, and it ensures we both walk away with a significant amount before the money loses too much value.""
