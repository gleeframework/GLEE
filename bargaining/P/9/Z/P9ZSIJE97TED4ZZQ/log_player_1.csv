"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it evenly!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll still give you a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is a 2/3 split, which is a significant difference from the 50/50 split I initially proposed.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a decent share""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more skewed towards Bob's favor, but still a significant improvement from the 40/60 split he offered in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'll give you a small chance 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

I'll think carefully about this offer. While I'm getting a smaller share, it's still a significant amount of money. I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the risk of potentially getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 375000, ""bob_gain"": 625000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a concession, but I still want a decent share""}

I'm proposing a 37.5/62.5 split, which is a bit more generous towards Bob, but I'm still trying to hold on to a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

I'll think carefully about this offer. With the money worth so much less, I'll have to prioritize getting something, rather than risking getting nothing. Bob's offer is a 20/80 split, which is a significant concession, but it's still a very small share for me.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer. I'll take the 200,000 and consider it a small victory."
