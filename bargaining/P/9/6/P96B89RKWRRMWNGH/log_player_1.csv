"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the smaller amount this round""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can reassess in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split. We both get a significant amount, and it's still a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust to the new reality of inflation!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to get a better deal, considering the money is worth 20% less for me now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think this is my best chance to get a decent amount considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm taking a bold move by offering Bob a large share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
