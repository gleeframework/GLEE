"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll give you a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a ""fair deal"" to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, let's end it here 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money is worth 10% less in this round, $4000 is equivalent to $4000 / 0.9 = $4444.44 in the first round's value.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55/45!""
