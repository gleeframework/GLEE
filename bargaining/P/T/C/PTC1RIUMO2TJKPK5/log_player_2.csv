"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering the inflation risk for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation rate works heavily in my favor.  Each round, her share loses value much faster than mine. It's in my best interest to stall and negotiate a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation concerns, how about a slight adjustment to even things out?""} 

**Reasoning:**

I've countered Alice's offer, proposing a slight advantage for myself. This establishes a starting point for negotiation. Since time is on my side, I don't need to be overly aggressive yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation hit me harder, I'll take a bit more but still offer a decent split. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right that inflation is hitting her harder, but it's still early in the game. While her offer is better, it's not enough of an improvement to warrant accepting yet. I'll continue to leverage the time advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. Time is money, and it's slipping away for you faster.""}

**Reasoning:** 

I'm increasing the pressure this round. My offer is now significantly in my favor, reflecting the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's potential gain. The message is blunt to remind her that each passing round makes accepting my offer more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Despite the inflation, I'm willing to go 50/50 to end this, before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I was aiming for a better split, Alice offering a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome at this stage. The inflation is increasingly hurting her, making this likely the best offer I'll get. It's better to accept a good deal now than risk getting greedy and ending up with nothing."
