"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a bit more equitable.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is more equitable, especially considering the inflation effect. I'd like to propose a different split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's split it 50-50, considering the inflation effect.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will consider it a fair compromise."
