"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose a near-even split, giving Bob a small token amount to incentivize him to accept. Since the money depreciates with each round, it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'm sticking with my initial proposal. Since the money is depreciating rapidly, I believe it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer.  Each round we go further, the less both of us will ultimately receive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer would have been enticing early on, the rapid inflation has made it clear he is taking advantage of the situation. I will continue to push for a fairer split, even if it means we both end up with less in the end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more realistic, accounting for the significant inflation. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to receive a reasonable amount before the money depreciates further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still far from fair, and the further we go, the less we will both receive. I will continue to negotiate for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm making another compromise, recognizing the significant impact of inflation. This offer gives Bob a larger share, but it's still a fairer distribution than his previous proposals.  It's critical we reach an agreement soon before the remaining value diminishes even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is more equitable than Bob's previous ones, it's still far from ideal. I believe we can do better and reach an agreement that is more balanced, even considering the substantial inflation.  We both have much to lose by continuing to reject each other's proposals."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. Given the accelerating inflation, we need to find a compromise soon. This offer allows Bob a significant share, while still preserving a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is closer to what I proposed, it's still not a fair reflection of the rapid inflation we're facing.  I'm not willing to accept this offer as we both will likely end up with significantly less than we could. We are close to the end, but I'm not giving up hope for a better compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

We're running out of time, and the value of the money is dwindling rapidly. I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with a larger share for Bob to acknowledge the inflation and encourage acceptance.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement before it's too late."
