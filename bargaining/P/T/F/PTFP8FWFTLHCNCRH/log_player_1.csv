"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but still a significant one, to see if he'll accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you'll have to negotiate further to get more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so the numbers are now:

* Alice's gain: 4000
* Bob's gain: 6000

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll consider a better deal, but 60/40 is still too skewed towards you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, the total amount is now 9,000$.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm not budging much more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 27.1% less than the original amount, so the total amount is now approximately 7,300$.

I'll reject this offer, as it's not a significant enough improvement from my previous offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a more substantial increase, 45% is still a bit low.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original amount, the total amount is now approximately 7,300$. However, I'll make an offer based on the original amount of $10,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I want a bigger share to make it worth my while. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 40.95% less than the original amount, so the total amount is now approximately 5,900$.

I'll reject this offer, as it's even more skewed towards Bob's favor than my previous offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give you a 65/35 split, I think it's too one-sided.""
}
```"
