"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see where we go from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair offer, but I think I can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the effective amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
* Bob gain: 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67

I'll have to think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and holding onto some of the money myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I want, but I'm not there yet. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective amounts considering the inflation:

* Alice gain: 4500 / 0.713 (1 - 0.287 = 0.713) = 6303.53
* Bob gain: 5500 / 0.713 = 7697.47

I'll have to think about it...

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I'm not going to give up too much more.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and holding onto some of the money myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure why you're not budging, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective amounts considering the inflation:

* Alice gain: 4000 / 0.591 (1 - 0.409 = 0.591) = 6766.83
* Bob gain: 6000 / 0.591 = 10165.92

I'll have to think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""

I'll accept Bob's offer this time."
