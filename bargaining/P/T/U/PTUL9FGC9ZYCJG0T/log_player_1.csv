Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor. Since we only have 12 rounds, I want to secure the majority of the money early. However, I'm still offering Bob a small share to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
