"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I believe it's fair to start with a significant portion of the money, as I am the one making the offer. However, I'm also aware that Bob might not accept it, and we'll need to negotiate further.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing at all, accepting Bob's offer is the best option.  It ensures I get a significant portion of the money, even if it's less than my initial proposal."
