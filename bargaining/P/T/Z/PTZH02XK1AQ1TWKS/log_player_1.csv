"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take the rest. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a relatively fair split, considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer, considering the inflation. Let's agree to this, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I think I can do better than this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 55/45 split, Bob. Can you consider a more even split?""
}
```

I'd like to try to get a more balanced split, considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better split.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 48% of the remaining money, Bob. It's a good deal, considering the inflation. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 480,000 dollars, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer. Let's see if he'll bite!"
