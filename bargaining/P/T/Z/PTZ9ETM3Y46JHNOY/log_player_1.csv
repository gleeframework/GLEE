Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly better deal than last round.  Since I'm the one making the offer again, I'm still losing value due to inflation.  I figure I can still get a fair split with this offer."
