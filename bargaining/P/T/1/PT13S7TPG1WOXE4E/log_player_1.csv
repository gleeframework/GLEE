Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a proposal that favors me a bit, but leaves room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a major concern. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me some money and avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
