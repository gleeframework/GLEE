Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts me less, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse, I'm still losing a significant amount to inflation by waiting.  Alice is clearly trying to take advantage, but I need to counter with a stronger offer to avoid getting even less in later rounds."
