"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'm willing to give you a decent share.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob receives 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain as 90% of the original amount.

My gain would be 90% of $300,000, which is $270,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal.
