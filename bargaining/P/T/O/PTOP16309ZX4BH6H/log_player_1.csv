"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more even split, considering the inflation we both face. I'm open to adjusting this in the future if you have any concerns. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough decision! Here's how I'm breaking it down:

**Pros of Accepting:**

* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split seems fair on the surface.
* **Certainty:** Accepting guarantees me something, while rejecting risks getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement.
* **Bob's Tone:** His message suggests he's open to negotiation in the future. 

**Cons of Accepting:**

* **Inflation Disadvantage:** The longer the game goes on, the more I lose due to the higher inflation rate.  
* **Potential for More:** I might be able to negotiate a better deal, especially since Bob seems willing to discuss.

**Decision:**

While the 50/50 split is tempting, I think I can leverage the inflation difference to my advantage.
