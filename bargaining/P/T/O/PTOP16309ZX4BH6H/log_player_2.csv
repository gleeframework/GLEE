"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer. I believe this split is fair considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer seems decent at first, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Alice is losing money at twice the rate I am, so I can likely negotiate a better deal for myself in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more even split, considering the inflation we both face. I'm open to adjusting this in the future if you have any concerns.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the even split offer, but the inflation difference is significant. I propose a slightly adjusted split that acknowledges this, while still giving us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is a good compromise. While I would have preferred a more even split, the inflation difference does need to be addressed. This offer gives me a decent amount while accounting for the inflation disadvantage Alice faces."
