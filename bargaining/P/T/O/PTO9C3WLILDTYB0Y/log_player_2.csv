Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. However, your offer doesn't account for the rapid rate at which your share loses value. This offer recognizes your need to settle quickly.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Consider the current state of the game and the impact of inflation on both players' potential gains.
We are in Round 4, and the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, while Alice's gain is worth 9.75% less. This significant difference in inflation impact suggests that I should prioritize reaching an agreement sooner rather than later to minimize my losses.

### Step 2: Evaluate Alice's previous offers and messages to understand her negotiation strategy.
Alice's messages indicate that she is aware of the inflation factor affecting my gains more significantly than hers. She has been trying to find a compromise but still prioritizes her gains, as seen in her offers. This suggests that Alice is a strategic player who is also looking for a fair deal but is aware of her advantageous position due to the differing inflation rates.

### Step 3: Determine a reasonable offer that considers the inflation factor and Alice's negotiation strategy.
Given the rapid devaluation of my potential gains, it's crucial to propose an offer that is attractive enough for Alice to accept while still maximizing my share. Considering Alice's last offer and the increasing urgency due to inflation, a slightly more favorable offer towards Alice might be necessary to reach an agreement.

### Step 4: Calculate the specific amounts for the offer based on the considerations above.
Given the previous offers and the need to find a mutually acceptable solution, offering Alice a slightly larger share than before, while still trying to maximize my gains, seems prudent. An offer of $4200 for myself and $5800 for Alice could be seen as a compromise, considering the inflationary pressures and the need for an agreement.

### Step 5: Draft a message to accompany the offer, explaining the reasoning and intent behind it.
The message should convey a sense of urgency and willingness to compromise, acknowledging the impact of inflation and the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. It should also hint at the possibility of further negotiations if this offer is not acceptable, to keep the dialogue open.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I'm making a compromise offer that still reflects the value of reaching an agreement sooner rather than later. I believe this split is more aligned with the current state of our negotiations and the pressures we both face. I'm open to further discussion if needed.""}"
