"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose that Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  I want to maximize my gain in the first round, knowing the money will depreciate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept this offer. Even though it's less than I wanted, I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round. There's a risk that Bob will be even more greedy and offer me less than $6,000. It's better to take what I can get now."
