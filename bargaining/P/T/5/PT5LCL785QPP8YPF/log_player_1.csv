"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm offering Bob 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and keeping $400,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since Bob is offering me $300,000, which is worth 75% of its original value due to inflation, I'm not getting a great deal. However, it's still a decent offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that I can do better in future rounds.
