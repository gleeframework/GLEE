Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep $999,999 for myself and give Bob $1. This is a very risky move, but I believe it's the best strategy to maximize my potential earnings. I'm hoping Bob will accept the offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
