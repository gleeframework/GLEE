"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty generous split in the first round.  I'll take 90% and leave Bob 10%.  I figure this will give me a good head start, and maybe even convince Bob to accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic decrease in my share.  While I don't know how the inflation is affecting him, I'm confident I can still get a better deal.  Let's see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 300,000, which is still more than his last offer, but a lot less than my initial proposal.  I'm hoping this will show him I'm serious about negotiating a fair deal, but also that I'm not going to cave to his demands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough.  While the inflation is hitting me harder, his offer is still a decrease from the last round, and I'm not willing to settle for less than what I offered him in the previous round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy. I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is more than his last offer, but less than what I offered in the previous round. I need to show him that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and I'm not willing to accept this significant decrease in my share. I'm confident that I can still get a better deal in the remaining rounds, despite the ongoing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a crucial moment.  I'm going to offer a 50/50 split. Given the increasing inflation, this seems like the fairest and most likely way to reach an agreement.  Both of us will walk away with something."
