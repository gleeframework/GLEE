Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit skewed in your favor. Let's be more realistic. How about a 60/40 split?  This accounts for the time value of money with inflation impacting me more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
