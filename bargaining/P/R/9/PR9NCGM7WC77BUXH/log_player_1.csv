"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the original $100, and I'll take the remaining $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, he's offering me $60, which is equivalent to $75 in the original amount, and he's keeping $40, which is equivalent to $50 in the original amount.

I'll accept this offer.
