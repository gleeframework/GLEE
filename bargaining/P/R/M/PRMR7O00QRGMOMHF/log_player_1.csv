I'm going for a risky strategy here.  By offering Bob just $1, I'm trying to force him to accept. If he rejects, he knows that he'll have to make a much more generous offer to me in the next round, as I'll be the one in control. However, if he's risk-averse, he might just accept the $1, hoping that he can do better in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a classic game theory scenario. Bob is trying to exploit the inflation by offering me a tiny amount of money, knowing that I'll likely be more desperate in the next round. However, I'm not going to fall for it. I'm going to reject his offer and continue playing.  The inflation will hurt Bob more than it hurts me, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm raising my offer to $900,000 for myself and $100,000 for Bob. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but still leaves me with a large share of the money. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept, but I'm prepared to keep negotiating if he rejects.  The inflation is starting to take effect, and I'm sure Bob is feeling the pressure."
