"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn was a bit generous, I'll take a slightly smaller share this time! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the rejection, Bob!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 450,000$ is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is 0.9 * 600,000 = 540,000$. So, the effective gain for me is 540,000$.

I'm not sure I like Bob's offer, as it's a bit more skewed towards him than my initial offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my gain of 540,000$ is now worth 90% of that, which is 0.9 * 540,000 = 486,000$. 

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, I'm willing to give you a bit more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 520,000$ this time, and keeping 480,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'm still not satisfied! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less each round, and we've had 3 rounds so far, the total reduction is 1.1^3 = 1.331, which means my gain of 486,000$ is now worth 486,000 / 1.331 = 364,000$. 

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as it's still quite skewed towards him. I'll reject it.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my gain of 364,000$ is now worth 90% of that, which is 0.9 * 364,000 = 327,600$.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all the remaining value!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 580,000$ this time, and keeping 420,000$ for myself."
