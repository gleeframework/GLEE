Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise, but don't think you can pressure me 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, the clock is ticking. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Accepting 440,000 now is better than holding out for a potentially slightly better deal and ending up with nothing if negotiations fail."
