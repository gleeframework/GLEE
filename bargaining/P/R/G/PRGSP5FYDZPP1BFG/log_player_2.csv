Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Let's call it even this time. I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. If we keep rejecting each other, we'll both end up with less. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
