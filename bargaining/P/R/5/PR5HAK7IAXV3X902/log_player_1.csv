"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can work together from here!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the proposal this round 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. He's trying to take a bigger share, and I don't think it's fair. I was hoping for a more equal split, and this offer is too skewed in his favor. I'll reject it and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55% is still too much. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which is a bit more in favor of Bob than my initial offer, but still not as skewed as his previous offer. I'm hoping we can find a more balanced solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 40 is still too little for me. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. He's still trying to take a bigger share, and I don't think 40 is a fair amount for me. I was hoping for a more equal split, and this offer is still too skewed in his favor. I'll reject it and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I think it's time we meet in the middle. Let's split the money 50/50 and end this game.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to a more balanced solution."
