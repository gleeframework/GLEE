"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, taking almost all the money for myself. I'm aware of the inflation but hoping Bob will be desperate enough to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm still unhappy with the 20% loss due to inflation, it's much better than getting only $1 in the previous round. Accepting this 50/50 split is the most rational choice."
