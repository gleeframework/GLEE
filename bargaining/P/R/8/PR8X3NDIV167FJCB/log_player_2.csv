**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a 50/50 split, but the longer we wait, the more we both lose.  It's still beneficial to hold out and hope for a slightly better deal in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is it - a perfectly even split. Let's end this before we lose even more to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Six rounds in, and the losses are becoming significant. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we continue to haggle. It's time to be pragmatic."
