"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a straightforward proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can both be happy!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'd rather take a slightly smaller share than risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
