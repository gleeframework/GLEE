Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm factoring in the inflation. Let's close this deal before it's too late for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

I'm still not happy with the deal. I think we can find a more equitable split."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit from this inflation too, and this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is significantly impacting both of us. Accepting this offer will at least give me some gains, and it's better than risking further losses in the next round."
