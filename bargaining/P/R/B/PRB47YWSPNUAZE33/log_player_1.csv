Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share this time, but I think we can still come to a mutually agreeable split. Let's avoid getting caught in the inflation spiral!  
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
