"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not give him such a large share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's too steep, I'd like a bigger share!""
}
```

Your turn again, Bob!"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find common ground. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting greedy, give me most of it! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting aggressive! With inflation eating away at my potential earnings, I'm getting desperate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's outrageous, I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```
