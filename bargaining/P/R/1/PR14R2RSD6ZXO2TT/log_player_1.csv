"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to start with a generous offer. Let's divide the money fairly and move on!""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial 100$, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, we would both get 50% of the remaining 100$.

However, considering the inflation, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than the initial 100$, which means he's actually getting 40% of the original amount (50% of 100$ is 50, but due to inflation, it's worth 40% of the original 100$).

I'd rather get a slightly higher share, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 50, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my advantage.""
}
```

This way, I get 55% of the remaining 100$, and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to get closer to a fair share, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer, taking into account the inflation:

Bob's gain is 60% of the remaining 100$, but due to inflation, it's worth 51.2% of the original amount (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%). 

However, I made a mistake in my previous calculation. The correct calculation for the inflation is 100% * (1 - 0.2)^4 = 76.8% of the original amount is worth 100$ after 4 rounds.

So, Bob's gain is 60% of the remaining 100$, which is worth 76.8% of the original 100$. 

I'd rather get a slightly higher share, so I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 60, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my advantage yet.""
}
```

This way, I get 58% of the remaining 100$, and Bob gets 42%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm making a bold move, will you meet me at this point? 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's offer, taking into account the inflation:

Bob's gain is 80% of the remaining 100$, but due to inflation, it's worth 32.77% of the original amount (100% - 67.23% = 32.77%). 

I'd rather get a higher share, so I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 80, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher. However, considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the original amount. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I'm not going to give up completely.""
}
```

This way, I get 30% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 70%."
