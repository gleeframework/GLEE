"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to get started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to get the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less than 40% share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 40 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is $38.

Bob's gain of 60 is worth 90% of the original amount, which is $54.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the next round, my gain will be worth 90% of the original amount, which is 90% of $38, or $34.40.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""You offered me 40% last round, I'll match that this time.""
}
```

I'm matching Bob's previous offer, but with the updated values due to inflation."
