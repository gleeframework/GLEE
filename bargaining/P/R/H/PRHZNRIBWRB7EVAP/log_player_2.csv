Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. This is my best offer yet. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation situation. While a 60/40 split seems heavily in her favor, it's important to remember that even if I reject this offer, the value will decrease further for me in the next round.  

**Strategy:**

I need to show Alice I'm willing to play this game for a while and won't accept a bad deal just because the value is decreasing. My hope is that she'll start to offer more reasonable splits to avoid the game dragging on."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""This is a reasonable offer, Alice. Take it or leave it - the clock is ticking for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

-  **Time Pressure:** I need to start applying pressure on Alice. By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I create a sense of urgency. 
-  **Shifting Focus:**  While I'm still aiming for a close to even split, I'm framing this offer as ""reasonable"" rather than focusing on the decreasing value. This subtle shift might make Alice more receptive.
-  **Future Leverage:** If she rejects this, I can argue in the next round that I've already compromised significantly, putting more pressure on her to make a move towards a fairer deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side, and so is the math. Take this or lose more. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is ruthless! It's clear now that she's willing to let this go down to the wire, hoping I'll panic as the value plummets. While accepting this offer means getting a significantly smaller share, rejecting it means risking even further losses. 

**It's time for damage control.  Taking the $380,000 (which is still a significant sum) is better than getting locked into a protracted negotiation where I might end up with even less.**"
