Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000, with a message saying ""Let's share fairly"".

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's close this deal now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I'm Alice, I need to decide whether to accept Bob's offer or not. Given the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less.\n\nLet's calculate the actual value of the money for both of us:\n\nFor me (Alice): 450,000 - 20% of 450,000 = 450,000 - 90,000 = 360,000\n\nFor Bob: 550,000 - 10% of 550,000 = 550,000 - 55,000 = 495,000\n\nConsidering the adjusted values, I think I can do better in the next round, so I'll reject Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob in each round, we need to consider the adjusted values.\n\nAssuming the initial value is still $1,000,000, I'll propose the following division:\n\nFor me (Alice): 500,000 (but it's actually worth 20% less, so it's 400,000)\n\nFor Bob: 500,000 (but it's actually worth 10% less, so it's 450,000)\n\nHowever, considering the adjusted values, I want to make the offer based on the actual worth, not the initial value. To simplify, I'll use the same numbers as above but keep in mind the adjusted values.\n\nHere's my offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway""}\n\nLet me know Bob's response.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
