"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I'm being generous, but I'm also trying to set the tone for a fair negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both get the most this way! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can split it evenly, huh?

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it evenly just yet. I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 5% less now, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""You wanted to split it evenly last round, but I think I can do better than that. Your turn again!""
}

I'm still being generous, but I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is losing value fast!

But I'm not ready to give up yet. Bob's offer is a bit too lopsided for my taste.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep pushing for a better deal. Maybe I can get Bob to meet me in the middle next time!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is getting even scarcer!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit greedy, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more than 35. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and keeping the negotiations going."

# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's willing to budge a bit more, but I'm not sure if I should take it.

```

}
```
