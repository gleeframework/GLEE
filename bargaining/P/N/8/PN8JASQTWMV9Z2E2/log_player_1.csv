Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. We're both losing money with each passing round. Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller share for both of us.
* **Bob's Final Offer:**  Bob has indicated this is his final offer. Rejecting it means risking an even worse offer in the next round, or even reaching a point where any potential gain is negligible due to inflation. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share, even if it's less than initially hoped for. 

It's important to be pragmatic in negotiations. Sometimes, securing a good deal means accepting a compromise rather than holding out for an ideal outcome that may never materialize."
