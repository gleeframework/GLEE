"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, the offer is:

Alice gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750
Bob gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750

I'll accept this offer.
