"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'll take nearly everything! I'm hoping Bob will be too greedy to accept my offer in the first round, giving me the chance to make a slightly less greedy offer later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's a much better deal than Bob's last one, it's still a 50/50 split. I can do better by forcing him into a more desperate position in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob 10% of the money, but this time I'm going to be a little bit more reasonable to avoid another rejection.  I'm counting on Bob to feel the pressure of the inflation and  getting closer to the final round."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. While it's tempting to take 250,000, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob's offer is getting more and more greedy with each round, and I think he'll be forced to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money this time. The pressure of inflation is building on Bob, and I want to stay ahead of the curve.  This offer should give him enough incentive to consider accepting, but I'm still getting a significant share of the pie."

# Alice gain: 333333 
# Bob gain: 666667 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more greedy, but I am not going to settle for such a small amount. I am still confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. I will continue to play the game and see if I can push Bob into a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

With each round, Bob is getting more and more desperate.  The inflation is hitting him hard, and he's likely to accept a slightly better offer than his last one. This time I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than in my previous offer, but I'm still getting the lion's share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more and more desperate, but I still believe I can get a better deal.  The pressure is mounting on him, and I'm sure he'll be willing to make a more substantial offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, pushing him to the brink. It's a risky move, but I believe the inflation pressure will force him to accept. I'm still getting the majority of the money, but I need to be careful not to push him too far and risk a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering me a larger share than before, the inflation is still significantly affecting the money he's offering.  With only a few rounds left, I believe I can get a better deal. The risk of a stalemate is real, but I'm willing to take it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're down to the wire.  The stakes are high.  I'm offering a 50/50 split, but I'm fully expecting Bob to reject it. He's desperate, and I believe he'll be forced to accept a very similar offer in the next round.  Let's see how this plays out."
