"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob! What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, Alice. I'll take a larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, looks like Bob wants a bigger share!

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

After considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to give up 70% of the remaining money, even if it's worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This split should be more to your liking.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting greedy. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns!

Considering the continued erosion of the money's value due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not eager to wait for another round and risk losing even more value...

After weighing the options, I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the 40% share, even if it's not the best deal. At least I'll get something!"
