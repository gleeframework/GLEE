"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a better offer, don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm actually getting a better deal than in the initial proposal. However, I'm not sure if Bob is being fair with his offer, considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer for now and wait for Bob's next proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but not too much!""}

I'm increasing the share for Bob by $500, but still keeping a slight advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit too greedy, meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a bit more generous than his previous one. However, I'm still not sure if I'm getting a fair deal.

I'll think about it... Ah, I've got it! I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal for me, but it's a decent compromise.
