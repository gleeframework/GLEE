"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly. It's important to note that the inflation rate is higher for me, so I'm aiming to get the biggest chunk of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 800,000 for myself, but still offering a decent 200,000 to Bob. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but I'm trying to reach an agreement before the inflation rates make the situation even worse."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, even with the inflation. It's getting risky, but I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
