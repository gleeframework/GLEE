6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a fair offer. This gives us both a good share.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,Your share decreases with each round due to inflation. I'm offering a bit over half to make it worthwhile for both of us to close the deal now.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation pressure, but your offer was too low. This is a more balanced proposal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking and your position is only getting worse with the inflation.  I'm meeting you closer to the middle this time, let's be reasonable and end this.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal.  This offer reflects the time pressure but also recognizes that we both lose if this drags on.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4900.0,5100.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer - it's almost an even split -  or I'm playing hardball from here on out.  Don't let inflation force you to take a worse deal later.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. Take it or leave it.",Alice,7,
