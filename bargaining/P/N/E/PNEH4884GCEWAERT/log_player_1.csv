"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, where I'll take $6,000 and Bob will take $4,000. I've included a message that says ""Let's split fairly"" to convey that I'm trying to be reasonable and find a mutually acceptable solution. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  Let's be reasonable. This offer is better than what you'll get in a few more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 20% less in this round, the $4,500 offered by Bob is actually equivalent to $3,600 in the first round. Considering this, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. My response is:\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'll try to be a bit more aggressive with my offer this time. I'll propose a 55-45 split, but keep in mind that the money is worth 20% less for me than in the first round, and 40% less than in the initial value. My offer is:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's compromise before it's too late""}\n\nYour turn!"
