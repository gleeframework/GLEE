Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a bit less, but I think a more even split is fairer. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I still think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me, I'm not feeling the pressure of inflation, and I'm hoping to get a more favorable split in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
