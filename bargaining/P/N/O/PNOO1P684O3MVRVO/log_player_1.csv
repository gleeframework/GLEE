"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still being generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll consider the adjusted values. My gain of $400,000 is worth 80% of the original $500,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 90% of the original $666,666.67.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Given the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to account for the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
