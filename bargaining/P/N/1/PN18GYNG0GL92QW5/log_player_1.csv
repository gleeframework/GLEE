"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob's offer is a 70/30 split, which is even more lopsided than my initial offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, I'll try to get a better deal. Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55/45 is a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is closer to a 50/50 split and takes into account the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet exactly in the middle, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to meet in the middle, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me, considering the inflation.

Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
