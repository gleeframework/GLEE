"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going for a large share, but I'm willing to give Bob something to consider. Hopefully, he'll accept in the first round, but I'll be prepared to adjust my offer if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with this offer.  While it's a fair split, I'm losing money due to inflation, and I think I can get a better deal by making my own counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than in my first offer, but it's still better than his 50/50 proposal. I'm hoping he'll realize that by rejecting my offer, he's risking getting less in the next round, and he'll be willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy. Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept a deal where he gets a 60% share. I'll make my own counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This time, I'm offering a more even split, but still giving myself a slight advantage. I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both losing out on money with each passing round, and he'll be more willing to compromise.  If he rejects this offer, I'm worried we'll end up with a much worse outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being increasingly unreasonable.  Even though I'm losing a lot due to inflation, I won't accept this offer.  I'm still hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round, even though I'm worried we're both going to end up with significantly less money than we could have had."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split this time.  I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, and I realize I'm unlikely to get a better deal.  I'm hoping Bob will see that we're both losing out on money with each passing round and will accept this fair offer."
