"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, I can calculate the actual amount of money I would get in the second round if I accepted Bob's offer.

Let's say Bob's offer is worth 80% of the original amount in the second round (since it's 20% less). Then, my gain of 300,000 in Bob's offer would be worth 300,000 / 0.8 = 375,000 in the original amount.

However, in the first round, I offered 900,000, which is still worth the same as in the second round. So, I would be getting 375,000 in the second round, which is less than my original offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can make a new offer. I'll try to be more generous this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I can calculate the actual amount of money Bob would get in the fourth round if I accepted his offer.

Let's say Bob's offer is worth 51.2% of the original amount in the fourth round (since it's 48.8% less). Then, Bob's gain of 500,000 in his offer would be worth 500,000 / 0.512 = 979,688 in the original amount.

However, in the first round, I offered 900,000, which is still worth the same as in the fourth round. So, I would be getting 500,000 in the fourth round, which is less than my original offer.

But wait, Bob's offer is actually a 50-50 split, which is a significant improvement from my previous offer. I think I'll take it.
