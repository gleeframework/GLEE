Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose that Alice gets $90 and Bob gets $10. This is a fair initial offer considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced offer this time, taking into account the inflation. Even with the discount, I believe this is a fair deal for both of us."
