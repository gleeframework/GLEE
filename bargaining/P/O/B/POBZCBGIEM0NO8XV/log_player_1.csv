"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

This is a fair starting point, giving Alice a slight advantage. It leaves room for negotiation in subsequent rounds. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is a bit more generous than the initial one, it's still too unfavorable. With inflation, my share is worth less, and Bob's is worth even less. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I'm proposing an even split. With the inflation factor, both of us will lose value if we continue negotiating, and a 50/50 split seems fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round. My share is significantly less than the initial offer, and Bob's share is decreasing more slowly. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm offering a slight concession to Bob, hoping he'll recognize the need to compromise as the inflation rates escalate. This should be a fairer division for both of us, considering the devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable with each round. My share is significantly less than the initial offer, and his share is decreasing more slowly. This pattern suggests he might be hoping to exploit the inflation effect to his advantage. I will need to continue negotiating for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm making a final offer. With inflation continuing to erode the value of our potential gains, it's in both of our interests to reach a compromise. I'm willing to concede a bit further, but this is my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable. My share is dwindling rapidly due to inflation, while his share is still much higher than the initial offer. I need to hold out for a fairer deal, even if it means we both get less in the end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

We're running out of time, and the inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  I'm willing to make another concession, hoping Bob sees the need to compromise.  We both stand to lose a lot if we don't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable and unrealistic. My share is dropping drastically, while Bob's share continues to increase. I need to hold out for a fairer deal, even if it means we both get less in the end. With only a few rounds left, it's crucial to avoid accepting an extremely unfavorable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}
```

With only two rounds left, it's clear that Bob is trying to maximize his share. However, the inflation is severely affecting both of us. I'm making a final concession, hoping Bob will recognize the need to reach an agreement before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unreasonable.  While inflation has impacted our potential gains, it's not worth accepting such an unfair division.  It's better to walk away with nothing than to be taken advantage of.  Both of us have been stubborn throughout this game, and now we're both going to suffer the consequences."
