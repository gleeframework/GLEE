Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is still too much in your favor. Let's try 60/40. It's a fair split considering the risk of inflation and the time we're wasting. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
