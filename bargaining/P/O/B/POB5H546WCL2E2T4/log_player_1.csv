"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think 70/30 is a bit too lopsided. How about we try a 80/20 split? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
