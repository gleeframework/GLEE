"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair one, and I'm hoping he'll accept quickly so we can wrap things up!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, no need to negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 5000$ is now worth 4500$ (90% of 5000$).

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob halfway, as it seems like I'll be giving up a significant amount of value. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, the current value of the total amount is 9,000$.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better share for myself, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you less, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 4000$ is now worth 2914$ (72.9% of 4000$).

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a bigger share, but I'm also not confident in my ability to negotiate a better deal at this point. I'll accept this offer.
