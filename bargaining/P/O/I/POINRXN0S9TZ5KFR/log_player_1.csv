"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
