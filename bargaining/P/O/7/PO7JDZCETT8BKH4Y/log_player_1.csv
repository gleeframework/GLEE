"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 900,000$ for myself and 100,000$ for Bob. I figure this is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation in the coming rounds.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a significant drop from my initial offer. While I've lost 20% of the value due to inflation, Bob has only lost 5%. This suggests he's being overly greedy. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 300,000. Since he rejected my previous offer, I'll need to offer more, but I'll keep a larger share for myself.  Let's see if he's more reasonable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is still not ideal, I'm feeling the impact of the inflation, especially with the 48.8% loss in my gain. However, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. The inflation is starting to bite, and I need to find a compromise.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, considering he's also facing inflation."
