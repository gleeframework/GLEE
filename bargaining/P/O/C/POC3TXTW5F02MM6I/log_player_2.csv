"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a slightly bigger share, but you get a good chunk too. 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's only Round 1, and I don't want to settle for less than half. Besides, the difference is quite small, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to see if I can get a more favorable proposal. The 5% inflation isn't a significant concern at this point. Bring on Round 2!"
