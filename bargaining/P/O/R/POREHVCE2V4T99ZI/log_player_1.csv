Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept. It gives me a good chunk of the money, and hopefully, he'll be happy with a small share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and while I'm losing a bit more due to inflation, I'd rather take the 50% now than risk getting nothing if we keep playing."
