# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is still worse than my initial offer, and the inflation is starting to hurt. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 4

I'll offer a 600,000 to 400,000 split, aiming to get a bit closer to what I want. Let's see how Alice responds to this."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

While I'd prefer a bigger share, inflation is starting to really impact the value of the money.  A 50/50 split is the best I can realistically hope for at this point."
