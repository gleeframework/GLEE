"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable division of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see it that way too and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a fairer split this time. Let's settle this before inflation eats into the pot! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with the offer of 4500 for me, especially considering the money is already worth 20% less than in the first round. I think I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is now worth 40% less than in the first round, but I'll make an offer that takes into account the current situation. I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor, hoping that Bob will accept it before the money loses even more value. My message to Bob is: ""Let's split the difference and end this game before we both lose more value!""\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split the difference and end this game before we both lose more value!""}"
