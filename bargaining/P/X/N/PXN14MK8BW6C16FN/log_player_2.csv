Let's see if I can get a better deal with inflation working in my favor!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair offer considering the potential for inflation.  Let's be smart and split the difference!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share given the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred my offer to be accepted, the inflation is starting to affect my potential gains. This offer is close to my original offer, and it's better than the risk of getting less in the next round."
