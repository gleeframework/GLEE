"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer. I figure Bob might be willing to take a small share to get something rather than risk getting nothing.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty bad, especially considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer and make my own proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still aim for a larger share. Bob might be getting a bit greedy, so I'll try to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous! Bob is becoming increasingly greedy. I'm still not getting a fair share, even with the inflation factored in. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced offer this time.  Inflation is really hurting us both now, so maybe a 50/50 split will be more appealing to Bob."
