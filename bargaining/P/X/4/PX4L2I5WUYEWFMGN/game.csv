75.0,25.0,I propose dividing the $100 with a ratio of 3:1. This ensures a fair distribution considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the decreasing value of money for me in the coming rounds. I believe this is a fair offer that allows us both to get a decent share.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
