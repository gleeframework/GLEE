Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nBob, I propose we divide the money fairly, with me receiving $600,000 and you receiving $400,000. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can avoid further rounds where the money's value decreases for you. What do you say, Bob? Will you accept this offer, or do you want to proceed to the next round?\n\n###\n\nWaiting for Bob's response..."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Since the money's value decreases by 20% for Bob in each round, I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Bob's offer of $400,000 for me is lower than what I initially proposed, so I'll try to get a better share in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3!

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although Bob claims this is his final offer, I'm not convinced. The money's value has decreased significantly for Bob, and I believe he'll be willing to negotiate further to get a deal done. Since the offer of $450,000 for me is still lower than what I previously proposed, I'll try to push for a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to Round 5! I'll make a new proposal.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob""}\n\n###\n\nBob, I'm increasing my share to $700,000 and offering you $300,000. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for you, this might be the last chance for you to get a decent deal. You're running out of time, Bob! Accept this offer or risk losing even more in the next rounds."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real. We both lose if this goes on. 50/50 is the only fair outcome. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is trying to appeal to fairness with a 50/50 split, I have to consider the current state of the game. The money's value has decreased significantly for Bob, and accepting a 50/50 split now would mean I'm essentially giving him a larger share of the original value. I've previously offered him deals that were more generous in terms of the original value, but he rejected them. Now, with the decreased value for Bob, I believe I can negotiate for an even better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to Round 7!

Considering how much value the money has lost for you, this is still a reasonable deal. You should have taken one of my previous offers when the money was worth more to you. Now, you're running out of options, and this might be your last chance to get anything significant. Accept this offer, or we'll see what the next rounds bring."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a hit from inflation, let's end this now before we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is right that the situation is getting ridiculous, I still believe I can negotiate for a better deal. The money's value has decreased dramatically for Bob, and accepting this offer would mean I'm giving up too much of the original value. I've been patient and strategic so far, and I think I can push for an even better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to Round 9!
