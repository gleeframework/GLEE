"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreased value of money, I'll have to be more cautious. However, I think meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
