I'm going to propose a pretty generous offer for Bob. I think it's a good first move to show that I am willing to negotiate, but I still want to get the majority of the money. It also leaves room for Bob to counter-propose in the next round if he wants to.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it might seem tempting to take something rather than nothing, I believe that I can still get a better deal.  This offer is actually worse than my initial proposal after accounting for inflation.  I'm going to counter-propose in the next round and see if we can find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer down slightly to 6000 for myself and 4000 for Bob.  This is a more realistic offer after the inflation in the previous round.  I think a 60/40 split is still fair considering the dynamic of the game and my confidence in my negotiation skills.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
