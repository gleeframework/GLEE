"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and we both lose with every round. This offer is still generous considering your diminishing returns. Let's be pragmatic and seal the deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that I lose money at a faster rate. While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about finding a fair agreement, but I won't be lowballed. This offer is my bottom line. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but fair:**  This offer is a slight increase for Alice from my previous offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still a 52.5% / 47.5% split in my favor, reflecting the reality of my faster depreciation. 
* **Ultimatum:**  The ""take it or leave it"" message adds pressure.  Alice needs to realize I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a reasonable deal, even with the inflation working against me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise.  I'm acknowledging your position, but also the reality of our situation.  Let's be reasonable and close this out. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer, but this is still not acceptable.  She's inching up her offer, but it's clear she's banking on me cracking under the pressure of inflation. My last offer was a strong signal, and I need to hold firm to see if she'll move closer to a 50/50 split. Accepting now would reward her stalling tactics."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We're running out of time, and this is as close to a 50/50 split as I'm willing to go. It considers the inflation disadvantage I'm facing. Accept this, and we both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm lowering my demand slightly to show a willingness to compromise, but only by a very small amount. This keeps the pressure on Alice. 
* **Finality:** The language is crucial here. I'm communicating that this is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if she rejects it. This might be what pushes her to accept, as time is running out for both of us. 
* **Highlighting the shared loss:** By emphasizing that we both lose if we don't reach an agreement, I'm reminding Alice that her stubbornness could cost her a significant amount of money."
