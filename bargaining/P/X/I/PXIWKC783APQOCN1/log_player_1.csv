Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. We're running out of time, and this is as close to a 50/50 split as I'm willing to go. It considers the inflation disadvantage I'm facing. Accept this, and we both walk away with something substantial.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is the best I'm likely to get at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is immense. The longer this drags on, the less we both get.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's losses are accelerating faster than mine.  While his offer slightly favors him, accepting now secures a reasonable sum. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a better offer is risky. Bob seems determined, and if negotiations completely fail, we both get nothing.

This is a case of choosing a reasonable gain now over the potential for a marginally better, but riskier, outcome later."
