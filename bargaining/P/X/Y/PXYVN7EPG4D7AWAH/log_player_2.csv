"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm Bob, and I'm going to be greedy. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  Let's see what Alice has to offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I'm taking 60%, but I'm open to negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect too much more 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is offering a slightly better deal, and with inflation taking a bite out of the money, I'm willing to accept. It's better to take something now than risk getting nothing later."
