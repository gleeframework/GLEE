I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer.  I want to get as much of the money as possible right away.  If Bob rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy in the future, but for now, I'm taking a big risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is significantly better for me than my previous offer. While I still lose half the money, it's a lot better than getting only $1. It's also reasonable to assume Bob might not be willing to risk another round and potential inflation."
