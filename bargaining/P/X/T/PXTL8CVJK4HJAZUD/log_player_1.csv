  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a 3:1 ratio, giving you 250,000$ and myself 750,000$. This way, we can ensure a fair distribution while also considering the decreasing value of money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is fairer, considering the value of money decreases faster for you than for me. Let's work together to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
