"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a balanced division""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I take 60 dollars and Bob takes 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin our negotiation."
