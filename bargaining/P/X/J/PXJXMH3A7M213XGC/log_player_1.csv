"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. I think this is a fair split considering you rejected my previous offer. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
