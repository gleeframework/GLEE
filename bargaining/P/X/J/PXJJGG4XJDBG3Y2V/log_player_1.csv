# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to take that into consideration when evaluating Bob's offer. Given that, I don't think $450,000 is enough for me, especially since I was willing to take $600,000 in the first round. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"

Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to carefully consider Bob's offer. While $475,000 is a decent amount, I still think I can get a better deal, especially since Bob is trying to rush the negotiation.

Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I need to re-evaluate my strategy. While I've been trying to get a larger share, the decreasing value of the money is becoming a significant factor. Bob's offer of $490,000 is starting to look more appealing, especially since we're halfway through the rounds. However, I still think I can get a slightly better deal.

Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in value of the money I gain, a 50/50 split is starting to look like a good deal. With the money being worth 30.17% less than in the first round, I would actually be getting approximately $350,000 in ""real"" value, considering the inflation.
