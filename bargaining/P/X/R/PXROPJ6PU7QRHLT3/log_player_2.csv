"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting an offer of only $1! That's not a fair division of the money. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 40% for me is a good starting point.""}\n\nI'm making a more reasonable offer, giving Alice the larger share but still keeping a significant amount for myself. It's the second round, so there's still room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a larger share. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take it, but I'm not thrilled about it. At least I'll get something out of this game. If I reject, Alice might not offer anything better in the next rounds, and we might end up with nothing. So, I'll play it safe and accept this offer.
