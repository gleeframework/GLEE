"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! Okay, let me think...

I don't like the 75-25 split, it's too skewed towards Bob. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm trying to find a more balanced split this time, taking into account the inflation that's reducing the value of the money. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now!

I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but it's still a better option than going to Round 5. I'll accept this offer.
