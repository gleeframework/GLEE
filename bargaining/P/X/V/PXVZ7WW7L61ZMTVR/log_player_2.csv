"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Understand the proposal
Alice proposes to split the $100 evenly between us.

## Step 2: Evaluate the proposal
Since the split is even, both of us will get $50. This seems like a fair offer.

## Step 3: Decide on the proposal
Given that the offer is fair and there's no apparent reason to reject an even split, the decision should be to accept the offer.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
