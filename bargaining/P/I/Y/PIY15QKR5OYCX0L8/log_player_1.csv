I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  While it might seem unfair, I am taking into account the inflation factor and want to ensure I get a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a 7000/3000 split, still in my favor, but recognizing Bob's previous proposal. I need to make sure I get a fair share considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, given the inflation and Bob's consistent push for more, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy.  I'll get something, and it's better than risking a lower share in the next round."
