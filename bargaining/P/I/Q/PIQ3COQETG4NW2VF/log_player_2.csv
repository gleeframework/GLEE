Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit less, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous considering the inflation hit you're taking 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my shrinking pot. While the offer is tempting as time runs out, I need to hold firm for a bit longer. Accepting now would send a message that I'm desperate, which could lead to worse offers later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is a fair 50/50 split.  Let's end this before we both lose out more.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game is getting dangerously close to the end. While the offer isn't great, rejecting it carries a significant risk.  If I reject and Alice doesn't offer me at least $4,100 in the next round, I'll be forced to accept even less to avoid getting nothing. It's a tough choice, but at this point, securing something is better than risking a total loss."
