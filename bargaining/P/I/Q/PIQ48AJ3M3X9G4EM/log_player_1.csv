"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the value of the money is decreasing. I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be desperate enough to accept this offer, but I'm not counting on it!"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect taking a bigger hit, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.
