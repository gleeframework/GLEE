"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the fact that Bob's gain is worth less due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a stronger offer now that I've rejected Bob's previous one. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim for a bigger share. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Your turn, Bob!"
