"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping $900,000 for myself and giving Bob $100,000.  I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, before inflation significantly reduces the value of my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option for me. Inflation has already diminished the value of the money, and if I reject, there's no guarantee that Bob will make a more favorable offer in the next round.  A 100,000 gain is better than nothing, and the risk of getting nothing in subsequent rounds is too high."
