```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

However, I realize that I've used up all my rounds, and according to the rules, if we don't agree on a split by the 12th round, both of us get nothing. I'll make one final attempt to propose a split, but it's a long shot.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, let's split it 50/50 and walk away with something!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not holding my breath."
