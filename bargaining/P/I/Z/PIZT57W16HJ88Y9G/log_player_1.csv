"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values. I'm being offered $300,000, which is less than the $500,000 I was initially offered, but still a significant amount.

However, Bob is gaining $700,000, which is a substantial amount considering the inflation. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems like I'm giving up a significant portion of the original amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that Bob's gain is worth 10% less due to inflation.

I'll aim to get a better share than in my previous offer, considering the reduced value of Bob's gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Considering the inflation, Bob's gain is now worth significantly less than in the first round. However, he's still gaining more than me.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems like I'm still giving up a significant portion of the original amount. However, the fact that Bob is willing to give me a slightly larger share than in his previous offer might indicate that he's willing to compromise.

I'll think about it for a moment...
