Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! This is practically down the middle. Take the deal before it's too late for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the inflation is severely cutting into Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob receives something rather than risking a complete loss if they continue to negotiate and fail to reach an agreement."
