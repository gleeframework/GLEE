Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, given that I'm the first to propose.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. If I reject, I get to make the next offer, but I'm not sure if I can secure a better deal than this, especially given the inflation that is now affecting Bob's gains. It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing later."
