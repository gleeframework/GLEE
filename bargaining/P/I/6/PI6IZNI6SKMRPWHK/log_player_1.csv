"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate for more in the next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and Bob gets 30%, which is $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a fair split for now, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $50 is worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's actually $45 in ""real"" value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's a 50-50 split, but it's still a bit less than my initial offer of $70. I'll think about it for a moment...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain of $45 is now worth 90% of that, so it's actually $40.50 in ""real"" value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up on my initial goal. You can try to negotiate for more in the next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor than the previous round's 50-50 split. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a firmer stance now. You can either accept or we'll keep negotiating. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Let's calculate the ""real"" value of my gain: $40 is worth 72.9% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's actually $72.90 in ""real"" value.

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal. I'll accept Bob's offer.
