"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount and can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly lower than before. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm still hoping for a fair split, but I'll give you a slight edge. Accept this and we can move forward!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll try to squeeze out a better deal. Let's see if I can get more! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the reduced value of my money, I'll have to be even more cautious.

However, Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to me than my previous offer, considering the inflation. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or wait for a potentially better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the 45/55 split. It's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk waiting for an even worse deal.""
}
```"
