"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take 60 dollars and offer Bob 40 dollars, with a message suggesting that this division is somewhat fair but slightly in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I'll be slightly more generous than you were. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is being slightly more generous than I was, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal, especially considering the inflation rate affecting my gains more significantly than Bob's. I'm willing to proceed to the next round to try and secure a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, where my gain is worth 20% less and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than the original, I'll propose a division that brings us closer to an equal split but still slightly favors me to account for the greater depreciation of my share. I'll offer to take 52 dollars, leaving Bob with 48 dollars, and include a message that suggests meeting closer to the middle ground considering the effects of inflation."
