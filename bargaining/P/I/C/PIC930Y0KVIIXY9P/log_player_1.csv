{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but there's enough for you to get started.  We can split it more evenly later if you'd like.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money equally, as it seems fair and efficient for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
