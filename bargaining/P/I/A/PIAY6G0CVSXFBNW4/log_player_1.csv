Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take 99 dollars for myself, and give Bob 1 dollar. This is a very lopsided offer, but since we have 12 rounds, I believe I can still be generous in the future and get us both a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
