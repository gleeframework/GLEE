Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a more even split, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, accepting a 45/55 split in Round 3 is strategically sound due to the rapid inflation. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value diminishes significantly. Waiting longer risks getting a smaller share of a much smaller pie.
* **Reasonable Offer:** Alice meeting halfway is a concession. Holding out for a significantly better deal in later rounds is risky and could backfire.
* **Guaranteed Gains:** Accepting ensures a decent sum, whereas continued rejection guarantees nothing but a shrinking pot.

It's better to secure a good amount now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
