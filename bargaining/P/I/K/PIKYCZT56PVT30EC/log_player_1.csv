"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI propose we divide the money 60-40 in my favor. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can avoid further rounds that would decrease the value of the money due to inflation. Waiting for your response, Bob.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a slightly better split. Think about the decreasing value! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money is decreasing, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or force Bob to accept a more favorable split due to the increasing pressure of inflation.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I propose a 52.5-47.5 split in my favor. This is a more generous offer than my first one, taking into account the urgency to reach an agreement before the money loses more value. Hopefully, Bob sees the reason in this and accepts, ending the game before we both lose more to inflation.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
