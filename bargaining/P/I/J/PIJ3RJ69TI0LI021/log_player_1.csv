"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the value of money is decreasing with each round. Let's get this done before we lose too much! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
