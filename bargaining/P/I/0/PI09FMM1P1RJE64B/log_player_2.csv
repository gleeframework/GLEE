"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I know about the inflation. Even though 50/50 seems fair, I can do better by rejecting and making my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Inflation is a factor, and this seems like a reasonable starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep the majority of the money. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though inflation is affecting my gains, I'm still not happy with a 45/55 split. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  We both need to be mindful of inflation, and this seems like a fair compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep the majority of the money. Let's meet in the middle again, but with a slightly more favorable split for me. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, inflation is really hurting my gains.  While a 47.5/52.5 split isn't ideal, it's better than getting nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers.  I'll accept this offer."
