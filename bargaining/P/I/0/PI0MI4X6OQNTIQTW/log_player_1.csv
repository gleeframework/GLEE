"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to split it evenly, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the negotiator! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of me with his negotiator's premium.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give Bob a 50% bonus just for negotiating. I think I can do better than that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can afford to be generous, but I still want to keep a significant portion of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You can have a smaller share, but I'm still being generous!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think I'm worth more than 3000? I'm starting to think you're not being generous at all! 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more desperate as the rounds go on!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've been too aggressive with my previous offers, and Bob's offer is actually a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer and take $5,800."
