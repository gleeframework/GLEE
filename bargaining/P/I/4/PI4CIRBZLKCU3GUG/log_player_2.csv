"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""My turn. This is a bit more advantageous for me, but still a good deal before inflation eats into it."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, still willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, Alice's offer is better than what I proposed in the previous round, considering the 19% inflation.  Further delay risks even greater losses to inflation."
