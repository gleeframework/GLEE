Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer.  While it's true that my potential gains have shrunk due to inflation, Bob's have shrunk even more.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me significantly less than my initial proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me receiving $5,500 and Bob receiving $4,500. This accounts for the inflation, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the current state of the game."
