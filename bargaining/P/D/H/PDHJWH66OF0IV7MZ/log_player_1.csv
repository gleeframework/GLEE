"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $600,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is to meet halfway, we'll both get $500,000. I'll accept this offer.
