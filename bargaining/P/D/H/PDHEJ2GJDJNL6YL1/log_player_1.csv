"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's try this again. Time is running out and the value is decreasing. This offer is slightly better for me than the last one.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be practical.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me. Bob's share is rapidly decreasing in value, making this deal worse for him with each passing round. I believe I can still negotiate a better share for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, it's clear we both want this over with. This offer gives you something and prevents us from losing everything to inflation. It's time to be realistic.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's a slight edge to you, but it ends this now. Otherwise, we both risk getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Time is running out. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I might be able to negotiate in the next round, especially considering the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
