"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you can take 10%""
}
```

I'm making an aggressive offer, taking the majority of the money upfront. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share this time. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more cautious now that the money is worth less due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get a better deal, considering the reduced value of the money. It's my turn to make an offer now!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 70% this time, but still keeping a significant amount for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 680000 
# Bob gain: 320000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer this time. The compromise seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better deal that might not come. I'll take the $680,000 and consider it a fair compromise."
