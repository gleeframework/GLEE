"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I think we can do better than 70/30, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $50 I would get is now worth 90% of the initial $50, which is $45.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, so I'll reject it.
