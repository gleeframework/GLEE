Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced split, recognizing that the inflation impacts you more severely than me. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
