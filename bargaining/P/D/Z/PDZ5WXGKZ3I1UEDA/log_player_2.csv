Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but your offer doesn't adequately account for the faster rate of inflation affecting my share. I'm proposing a more equitable split that acknowledges this difference. Let's settle this fairly. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
