Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slight lead""}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but with a slight advantage for myself."

# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, let's aim for a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
