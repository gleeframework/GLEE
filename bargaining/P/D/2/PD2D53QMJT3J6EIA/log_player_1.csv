"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have it all, let's start with a more realistic split. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money's value, my gain of $20 is worth 20% less than the $60 I proposed in the first round, which is a significant reduction.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor, especially considering the initial value of the money was $100. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is a bit too generous for you, Bob. I'll make a counteroffer: 45 for me, 55 for you.""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting the money's value, my gain of $45 is worth 20% less than the $45 I proposed, which is $36.

Here's my new offer:

```

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money's value, my gain of $36 is worth 48.8% less than the $60 I proposed in the first round, which is $19.52.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting a bit desperate indeed, but I don't think it's wise to give in to such an extreme offer. $10 is a very small share of the remaining money.

I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not giving in yet? I'm not giving in either! Let's try 25 for me, 75 for you.""
