Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, given the inflation that is working against me. Let's be reasonable and end this early. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice rejects Bob's offer of a 55-45 split, suggesting she believes she can get a better deal in subsequent rounds, especially considering the inflation affecting Bob's share. The game proceeds to the next round."
