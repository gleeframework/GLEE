"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving Bob a relatively small amount to get us started. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You gave me a small amount last time, now it's my turn to make a bigger offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think 40 is still too low considering the inflation. I'm hoping that Bob will make an even better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 40% of its original value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to keep some for myself to be able to afford the decreasing value of the money.""
}
```

I'm making a new offer, giving Bob a larger share, but keeping a smaller amount for myself to account for the inflation. Your turn, Bob!"
