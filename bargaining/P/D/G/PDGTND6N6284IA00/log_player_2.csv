"Round 1
Alice's offer:

While Alice's offer is fair, there's a chance I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round. The inflation factor is a strong incentive to get the best deal possible."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good deal considering inflation will take effect in the next round. Let's end this quickly!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'm unlikely to get a better deal than a 42/58 split. It's important to consider that Alice might also be considering the inflation factor and I could end up with nothing if I keep rejecting offers."
