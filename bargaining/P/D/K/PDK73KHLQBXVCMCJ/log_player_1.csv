"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can take 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need for extreme splits 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer! A 50-50 split seems fair, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being worth even less."
