"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth $380,000, and Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth $540,000. I think this is a reasonable offer, considering the changed circumstances.
