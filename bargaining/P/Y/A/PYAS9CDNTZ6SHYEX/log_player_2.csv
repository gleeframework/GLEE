"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant share to make this worth my time. Let's split it 60/40. This is a good deal for both of us before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a seemingly ""fair"" 60/40 split, the inflation is heavily in my favor.  It's worth it for me to play hardball a bit longer and see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
