"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 4000. How about 5500 for me and 4500 for you? This is a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation too, Bob.  But I'm still willing to be reasonable. Let's split it 60/40 this time. It's a fair compromise considering how the value is changing. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting 4000 at this stage would be a significant loss compared to the potential gains in earlier rounds.  Alice is clearly aware of the inflation affecting me and trying to leverage it. Holding out a bit longer might push her to offer a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the wire here.  I'm willing to accept a smaller share than my previous offer, but 55/45 feels like the sweet spot considering the time pressure and inflation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, both players should feel the urgency. 
* **Concession:** Offering 55/45 shows a willingness to compromise from the previous 58/42.
* **Inflation Factor:** While Bob is feeling the heat of inflation, highlighting it continuously might not be beneficial. This offer tries to balance firmness with a sense of urgency."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'm willing to go up to 6500 for myself, but that's my final offer.  We both need to make a decision soon. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. While the clock is ticking and 3500 is something, Alice's offer is far from fair. She's clearly playing on the pressure of the situation. With 5 rounds left, there's still a chance for a better deal. A rejection sends a strong signal that Bob is serious about getting a more equitable split."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real, we both lose if this goes any further.  52/48 is my final offer - it's a win-win before inflation eats away at everything.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  This offer conveys a sense of urgency and finality. It tells Alice this is the time to make a deal. 
* **Slight Compromise:** Dropping to 52% shows a willingness to negotiate, but also sets a firm boundary.
* **Framing the Loss:** Highlighting the shared loss from inflation puts pressure on Alice to agree before time runs out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're in the endgame now. I'm willing to take a larger share, but 7000 is my absolute maximum.  If we don't reach an agreement, we both lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is it, the final stretch.  While 3000 is significantly less than hoped for, rejecting this offer carries immense risk.  

* **High Stakes:**  With only three rounds remaining, the threat of getting nothing is very real.
* **Alice's Stance:** Her language suggests this is her final offer, and she might not budge.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if Bob manages to secure a slightly larger share in the next round or two, the impact of inflation will be severe.

It's painful, but taking 3000 now is a safer bet than risking a complete loss."
