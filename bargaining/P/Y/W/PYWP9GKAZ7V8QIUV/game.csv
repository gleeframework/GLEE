950000.0,50000.0,"Let's make a deal, Bob. This gives you a good share and avoids the risk of inflation eating away at our potential winnings.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
50000.0,950000.0,"I think we should aim for a more equitable split.  Let's try a 95/5 split in my favor this time.  This gives you a decent chunk of the money, and we can both avoid the risks of inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
900000.0,100000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but it wasn't quite fair considering the inflation we face. This offer still gives you a significant share and allows us both to benefit before the money loses too much value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Alice,  let's try a 90/10 split this time. I'm willing to go down a little from my previous offer, but I think this is still fair considering the risk of further inflation.  This gives us both a significant share of the money.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here. This offer is a middle ground between our previous proposals and ensures we both get a good amount before inflation takes its toll. Let's be reasonable and end this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
150000.0,850000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to meet you in the middle on this. Let's split it 85/15 in my favor.  This is a fair compromise given the current inflation rates and will allow us both to secure a decent amount.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
800000.0,200000.0,"Bob, it's clear we're both aiming for a good share, but we're running out of time. This offer is a substantial amount for you and still leaves me with a decent portion considering the inflation. Let's be practical and close this deal.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice,  we're getting closer. I'm willing to offer an 80/20 split in my favor. It's a fair compromise given the time constraints and the inflation hitting us. Let's end this here.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, we're down to the wire here. This offer still gives you the lion's share, and we both need to agree before inflation eats away at this any further. Let's be smart and take this deal.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"Alice, we're both facing increasing losses with each passing round. I'm offering a 75/25 split in my favor. This ensures both of us get something significant before the money becomes worthless. Let's be rational and close this deal.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a serious hit from inflation.  You need to propose something reasonable or we both lose EVERYTHING. This is my final offer.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, we're both at risk now, but I'm willing to make a final concession.  Let's split it 65/35 in my favor. It's the best we can do at this point, and it's better than losing everything.  Let's end this.",Bob,12,
