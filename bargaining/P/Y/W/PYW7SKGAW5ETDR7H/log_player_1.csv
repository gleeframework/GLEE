Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I figure Bob might be greedy and want to see if he can do better."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept such a small amount. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. While inflation is hurting me, Bob is also losing out on a lot of potential money by refusing to accept a fair deal."
