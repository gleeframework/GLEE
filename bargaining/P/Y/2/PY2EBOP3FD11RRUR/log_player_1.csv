"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a generous offer considering the inflation that will start to affect us both in the next round.  Let's hope for a quick resolution!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair, and with the inflation taking effect, it's likely that any further negotiation will only lead to a worse outcome for both of us. I accept."
