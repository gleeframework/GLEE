"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be fair"". This is a common starting point in negotiations, and the message is an attempt to frame the offer as reasonable and appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn. Will he accept my offer or make a counteroffer?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a more balanced split. This offer won't be as good next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, I don't feel pressure to accept a less favorable offer. Additionally, Bob's message tries to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not convinced that the next offer will be worse.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI'll make a new offer. Since the money is still worth the same to me, I'll try to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'll offer a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message that tries to persuade Bob that this is a good compromise.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway""}\n\n###\n\nWill Bob accept this offer or make another counteroffer?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the last round before inflation significantly hurts us both. Let's end this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Although I was trying to get a better deal, Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is a significant concession, and the message suggests that he's willing to compromise to end the game. Given that the money is still worth the same to me, I think this is a fair outcome.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
