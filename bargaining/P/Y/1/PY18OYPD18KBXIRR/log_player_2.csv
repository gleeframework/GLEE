Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was already generous considering I went first. This offer is a compromise, slightly better for you than last round, and it's crucial we settle now before inflation eats further into our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58
