"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I take the lion's share, you get a small reward.  Accept this and we're done. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and while I appreciate Alice's offer, I'm not sure I can accept such a small reward. There are more rounds to play, and with inflation, my share could dwindle even further.  I'd like to see if I can negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good share and don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our gains.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get the majority share.  Accept this and we can end this game. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I appreciate Alice's willingness to compromise, 50,000 is still a very small amount, and it's unlikely to be worth much after inflation. I'm not ready to give up on getting a fairer deal.  I'd like to see if I can negotiate a more equitable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a significant share, Alice, but I need to ensure I also get a fair amount.  Let's split the money 60/40, with me getting 600,000 and you getting 400,000. This way, we both get a good amount, and we can end this game before inflation eats away at our gains further.""}
