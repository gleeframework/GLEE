Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is a 50/50 split, which is the fairest option considering the inflation. Let's avoid further losses and agree to this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the safest option.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing increases substantially. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the negotiations go on, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us, but especially for Bob.
* **Unpredictable Behavior:** Bob's offers haven't followed a strictly logical pattern, making it difficult to predict if he'll offer more favorable terms in the future.

Accepting the 50/50 split guarantees Alice a reasonable share, even if it's less than she initially aimed for."
