"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself. Since the money loses value over time, I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split the money more evenly considering it loses value with each round.  This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and considering the offer is less favorable to me than my initial proposal, I decide to reject Bob's offer. The fact that the money loses more value for me with each passing round creates a sense of urgency, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nConsidering the money's devaluation, I'm trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer but still appears reasonable. By suggesting ""Meet me in the middle,"" I'm attempting to appeal to Bob's desire for fairness and compromise, hoping he'll accept this offer before the money loses even more value."
