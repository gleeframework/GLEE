"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a greedy approach, aiming for almost all the money. Since Bob can always accept the offer and end the game, giving him a tiny amount might be enough to incentivize him to do so. Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep pushing for more, the inflation factor changes the game. Bob's offer is fair considering the potential for the money to lose value further. Accepting this guarantees me half the money, which is a decent outcome."
