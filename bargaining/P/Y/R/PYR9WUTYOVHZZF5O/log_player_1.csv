"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation, this is a good deal for you.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and I'll take $6,000. Given the inflation rates, I believe this is a reasonable and fair offer for both of us. Waiting for Bob's response!"
