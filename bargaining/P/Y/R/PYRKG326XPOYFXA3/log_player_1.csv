"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair and reasonable start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 80/20, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's a good starting point. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $40 is worth 20% less than the $80 I proposed in the first round, so it's equivalent to $32. And Bob's gain of $60 is worth 5% less than the $20 he proposed in the first round, so it's equivalent to $18.80.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm willing to accept such a low share. I was hoping for a better deal!""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim to get a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's try to find a compromise. Your turn again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is worth 48.8% less than the $80 I proposed in the first round, so it's equivalent to $41.60. And Bob's gain of $50 is worth 14.26% less than the $20 he proposed in the first round, so it's equivalent to $17.14.

I'm surprised Bob is willing to meet me in the middle, and I think this is a fair offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think we've found a good compromise! Let's split it 50/50.""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer and ending the game."
