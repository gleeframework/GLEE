Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal.  While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, I'm not sure it's worth it.  Let's see if we can negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, aiming for a compromise while still keeping a decent amount for myself.  This should hopefully be enticing enough for Bob to accept, as the inflation is starting to affect his side of the bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer from Bob is even worse than his last one.  While the inflation is hurting him more, he is now being extremely greedy.  I'm not going to accept this offer.  I'm confident that we can negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to make one more concession, but I'm sticking firm on getting at least 7000.  Inflation is impacting Bob more now, so he may be more inclined to take this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous!  Bob is now being incredibly greedy and taking advantage of the inflation.  I will not accept this offer.  I'd rather get nothing than agree to such an unfair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to stick to my guns and offer a more balanced split.  Bob is being incredibly stubborn, but I'm hoping that this offer, combined with the increasing inflation on his side, will finally be enough to reach an agreement.  This is my final offer!"
