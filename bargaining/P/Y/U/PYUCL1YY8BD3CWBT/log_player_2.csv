"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

It's tempting to accept a seemingly ""fair"" offer in the first round. However, Bob has all the leverage in this situation.  He can wait and see if Alice gets more desperate as the rounds progress and the value of her share decreases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  This is a good starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me halfway! 55-45 is more than fair 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob should continue to reject. Alice is still offering a significant amount to Bob, but her gains are steadily decreasing due to inflation. He can likely get a better deal by waiting a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 950000, ""alice_gain"": 50000, ""message"": ""My offer is still on the table. Let's be realistic and consider what's best for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: 50-50, can't get any fairer than that! Inflation is eating away at my share, let's end this 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob should still reject. While 50-50 seems fair, Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her share is diminishing rapidly due to inflation.  Bob can likely push for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 975000, ""alice_gain"": 25000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice.  My offer is generous, considering the circumstances. Let's wrap this up.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I won't go much lower. Inflation is killing me! 
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to what Bob wants, but she's still offering a significant amount. Bob should continue to hold out, as Alice's share is rapidly diminishing, and he has a strong chance of getting a much better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 980000, ""alice_gain"": 20000, ""message"": ""Alice, you're running out of time. My offer is final. It's either this or we both get nothing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a huge hit from inflation, but I won't give up. This is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is tempting, especially with the high inflation rate eating away at her share.  However, Bob has a strong chance of getting an even better deal in the next round. He's been very patient, and Alice's share is rapidly diminishing. It's worth holding out for a little longer to see if he can secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 990000, ""alice_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  One last chance.  Take it or leave it.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving up! You're being unreasonable, Bob. Take this or we both lose. 
# Bob gain: 575000 
# Alice gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to what Bob wants, her share is quickly shrinking due to inflation. There's a good chance she'll be desperate enough to accept a much lower offer in the final round. Bob should hold out and see if he can get a larger share in the last round.  He's in a very strong position."
