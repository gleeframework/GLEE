Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. Let's stop wasting time with inflation eating away at our potential profits.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution.  Do you agree? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
