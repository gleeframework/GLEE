Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation disadvantage I'll face in later rounds.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice is willing to compromise, and a 45/55 split is pretty good considering the inflation she's facing."
