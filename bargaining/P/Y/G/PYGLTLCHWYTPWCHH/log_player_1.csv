Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a tiny amount to see if he's willing to accept it right away.  I know the money is worth less to me each round, so I want to try and get as much as possible as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair split, and each round makes the money worth less. It's better to accept now than risk losing more."
