"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a division of $95 for me and $5 for Bob. This is a fair starting point, and it allows us to see if Bob is interested in negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
