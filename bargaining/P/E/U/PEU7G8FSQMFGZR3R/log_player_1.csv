**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The money is losing value rapidly. Waiting any longer will result in a significantly smaller payout for both of us, even if I manage to negotiate a slightly better split. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. He might propose even less favorable terms, putting me in a worse position.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split, while not what I aimed for initially, is objectively fair. Accepting demonstrates a willingness to compromise and avoid a lose-lose situation."
