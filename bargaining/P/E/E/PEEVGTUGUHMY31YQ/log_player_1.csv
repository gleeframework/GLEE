"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, and keeping 60 dollars for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, I notice that Bob's share is increasing, which might be a good sign.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
