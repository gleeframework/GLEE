"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very uneven split. I want to see how Bob reacts to this offer.  If he rejects it, I'll adjust my offer for the next round to be a little more equitable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, it's better to get something than nothing. With each round, the money is worth less, and this offer is a fair split."
