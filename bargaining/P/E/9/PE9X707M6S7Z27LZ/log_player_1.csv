Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Review Previous Offers
In Round 1, I offered a 60/40 split in my favor, which Bob rejected. In Round 2, Bob offered a 55/45 split in his favor, which I rejected.

### Step 2: Determine the Next Offer
Given that both initial offers were rejected, it's clear that neither of us is willing to accept a split that heavily favors the other. Since the goal is to reach an agreement within 12 rounds or risk losing the money, my next offer should aim to find a middle ground that is more likely to be accepted by Bob.

### Step 3: Calculate the New Offer
Considering the previous offers, a logical next step is to propose a split that is closer to equal but still slightly in my favor, as I am the one making the offer. A 52/48 split seems reasonable, as it narrows the gap further and shows willingness to compromise.

### Step 4: Formulate the Offer and Message
My offer will be for me to receive $52 and for Bob to receive $48. The message will convey a sense of compromise and the hope for a mutually acceptable agreement.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Narrowing the gap, hoping for a compromise""}"
