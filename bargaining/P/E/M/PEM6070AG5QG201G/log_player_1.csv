I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal. I'll take 90% and leave 10% for Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is ridiculously unfair.  I'm not going to accept that!  Let's see what I can do with my offer in round 3."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, but still leave Bob with a decent share. I'm hoping he'll realize that rejecting my offer in the last round wasn't a good idea, and he'll accept this one.  Let's see what happens."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is getting greedy! His offer is still too low, and the inflation is hitting my share hard. I'm not going to accept this. Let's see if we can reach a better agreement in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to make a reasonable offer. I'm dropping my share again, but I still think it's fair, considering the inflation is hitting my share much harder than Bob's.  I'm hoping he'll finally see reason and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low. He's taking advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I'll keep fighting for a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm still trying to be reasonable, but inflation is making it tough. I'm dropping my share again, but I'm hoping Bob will finally realize that we need to compromise.  I'm not willing to accept his lowball offers anymore.  Let's see what happens."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the inflation is hurting me too much. I've lowered my share as much as I'm willing to, and it's time to take what I can get. Even though it's not ideal, a 50/50 split is better than ending up with nothing!"
