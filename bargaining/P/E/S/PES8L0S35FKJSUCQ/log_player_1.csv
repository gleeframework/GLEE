"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's start with a clean slate!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting strong, let's see if you can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is 40/60, it's clear that Bob is trying to take a larger share of the initial $100. However, I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me, considering the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to make a better proposal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation rate""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a slight adjustment from my initial offer. I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
