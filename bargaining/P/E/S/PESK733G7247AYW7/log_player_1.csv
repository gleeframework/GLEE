"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. If I reject it, the next round will see my potential gains further reduced by 20%, while Bob's potential gains only decrease by 5%. It's a better outcome than risking another round and losing more value."
