"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 75-25 split, even if it's a slightly better offer than the previous one. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 45-55 split. Let's shake on it!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, and a 45-55 split seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, as it's a fair and even division of the remaining funds."
