Let's see if Bob is feeling generous. ðŸ˜œ  I'll take the lion's share for now, but we can adjust things in the next round based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
