Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, my share should increase 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a good deal for both of us considering the time pressure and inflation working against me.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are significantly hurting any potential gains for Bob. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob receives something rather than risking getting a worse deal or even nothing in a future round."
