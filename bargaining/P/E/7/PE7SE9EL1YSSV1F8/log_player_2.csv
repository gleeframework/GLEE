This is a tough one! Here's why I made the decision to accept:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. Waiting any longer means I'll be getting even less.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice seems to be pushing for a 57/43 split. It's unlikely she'll offer anything significantly better at this point.
* **Something is Better than Nothing:**  Rejecting this offer means risking getting zero in a potential round 6 if Alice plays hardball. 

While 43 isn't ideal, it's better to take a smaller share now than potentially end up with nothing."
