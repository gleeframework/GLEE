  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,

This is a straightforward offer, where we both get equal halves of the money."

  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, I need a bigger share of the pie""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 25% of the total amount. This is getting ridiculous, and I'm starting to think Bob is just trying to drive me down to a lowball offer. I'm not going to accept this."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 20% of the total amount. This is the last round, and I'm not going to accept an offer that's so heavily skewed in Bob's favor. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept this offer."
