"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40% and keep 60%, a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad compromise, but I'm not sure I want to give up 40% of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60% to him and 40% to me, I'll try to counter with an offer that's a bit more favorable to myself. I'll offer 55% to me and 45% to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
