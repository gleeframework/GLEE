"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more fair split, considering we both have equal power in this game. Let's agree and move on. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the offer from Bob is actually more generous than it initially seems.

However, I'm not convinced that 40 is a fair share for me, considering the initial offer I made was 60. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 40 is enough for me, considering the initial offer was 60. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. How about 48/52?""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this more modest proposal."
