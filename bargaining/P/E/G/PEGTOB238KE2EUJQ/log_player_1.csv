"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I don't want to accept an offer that gives me less than I initially proposed, especially since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round. I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 2, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 10% less. I'll take this into account and make a new offer. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm trying to balance the value of our gains to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse!

I'll have to adjust my strategy. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that Bob's gain is worth less. Here's my decision:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take Bob's offer, as it's a better deal than my previous offers, considering the inflation."
