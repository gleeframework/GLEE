"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, to set the tone for a fair and reasonable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can start with less this time. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take the lead with a higher share. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, as I think it's too lopsided in his favor. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""You took a big share last round, now it's my turn to adjust. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slight adjustment to the ratio, giving me a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to take the lead."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is still trying to push for a larger share. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, as I don't think it's fair to me. I'm still holding out for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm not getting taken advantage of. Let's meet in the middle again.""
}
```

I'm making another small adjustment, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the middle, but I'm still thinking I can do better. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is still trying to push for a larger share. I'm not happy with this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, Bob. I think we've been dancing around the same numbers for too long. Let's try to meet in the middle again.""
}
```

I'm sticking with a similar proposal to round 3, hoping that Bob will finally accept a more balanced split."
