"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this offer, or risk losing more in the next round due to inflation.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the risk of inflation, but your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a more equitable split. Let's be fair and avoid further devaluation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, inflation is eating away at the value. This is my final offer before it dwindles further. Let's close the deal now and both walk away with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now more reasonable than her first offer.  Importantly, if I reject this offer and propose a counter offer in the next round, even if Alice accepts a 60/40 split in my favor in a later round, the impact of inflation will mean she receives less than the 550,000 offered in this round.

It's time to cut my losses and accept a reasonable offer before inflation erodes the potential gains further."
