"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, as I am taking the initiative to make the first offer. I believe it's in Bob's best interest to accept this, as there's a high chance we'll lose money if we go to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair, and the money is losing value with each round. It's better to accept than risk getting nothing."
