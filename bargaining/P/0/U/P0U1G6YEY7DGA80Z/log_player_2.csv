Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. A 50/50 split seems fairest given the inflation we're both facing.  We can both get something, and avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
