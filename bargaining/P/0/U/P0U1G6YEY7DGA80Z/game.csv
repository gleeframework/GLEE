60.0,40.0,Let's start with a fair split.  I'm willing to give you 40% since you are taking more of the risk with the decreasing value of your share.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better.  I'm taking a bigger risk with the decreasing value of my share, so I propose we split it 55/45. Let's work together!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's meet in the middle. A 50/50 split seems fairest given the inflation we're both facing.  We can both get something, and avoid further devaluation.",Alice,3,
