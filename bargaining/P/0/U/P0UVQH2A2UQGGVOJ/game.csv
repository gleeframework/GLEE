55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. I'm taking a smaller hit from inflation than you. $55 for me and $45 for you is a fair compromise.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Let's split this evenly. I'll take $55 and you can have $45. We're both losing value due to inflation, so let's make this quick and fair.",Bob,4,

52.0,48.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I understand you want a good deal, but we're both losing money the longer this goes on. I'm coming down to $52, you get $48.  Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
