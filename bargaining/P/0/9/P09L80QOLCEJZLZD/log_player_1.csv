"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me 20% less than my initial proposal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation has already taken a toll, I'll aim to get a better deal this time. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves room for Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not again! I was hoping Bob would accept my previous offer, but it seems I'll have to negotiate further. Considering the inflation has taken a significant toll on Bob's share, I'll try to take advantage of it. However, I'll still aim for a fair deal.

Since Bob's offer is very close to the original 50-50 split, I'll accept it.
