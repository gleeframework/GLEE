"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the difference in future rounds""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can build on this foundation in future rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want more for myself 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment...

I'm not thrilled with the ratio, but I don't want to waste another round either. I'll accept this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
