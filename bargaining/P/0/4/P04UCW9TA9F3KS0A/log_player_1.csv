Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this round. We can figure out the inflation issue later. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more this time, Alice, but we need to reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is offering slightly more, the deal is still not favorable in the long run.  The inflation is eating significantly into Alice's potential gains. She needs to push for a better deal quickly, or the time pressure will work against her."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close to the deadline. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** Time is running out, and Alice needs to make it clear this is a serious offer.
* **Inflation:** The longer this goes on, the less valuable any offer becomes for Alice. 
* **Strong Stance:** By framing this as her ""final offer,"" she's hoping to push Bob towards acceptance rather than risking another rejection and further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for more due to inflation, but we're running out of time. This is my final offer, I won't go lower. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but time pressure is becoming critical. Here's why Alice should accept:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, accepting 6000 now is better than risking even less in later rounds due to inflation. 
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob has labeled this his ""final offer.""  There's a high chance he won't budge, and Alice could end up with even less if she rejects.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal in the few remaining rounds carries a significant risk of getting nothing at all. 

It's a bitter pill, but sometimes the best negotiation tactic is accepting a less than perfect offer to avoid losing even more."
