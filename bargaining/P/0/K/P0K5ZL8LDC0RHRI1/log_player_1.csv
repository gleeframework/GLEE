Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, hoping that Bob will see it as a reasonable starting point and accept it to avoid further inflation."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair, considering the inflation rate. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
