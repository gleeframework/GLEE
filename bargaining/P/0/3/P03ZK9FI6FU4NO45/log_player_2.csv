"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can adjust later if needed. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll try to negotiate a better deal.  10% is too low."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's start with that and see if we can reach a more agreeable solution.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to come down a bit, but I think a 65/35 split is more reasonable considering the inflation. Let's work towards a deal before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take it. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing!"
