Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and offering Bob 100,000.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something, I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself in the next round, even with the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split this time.  Since Bob's money is depreciating faster, I'm betting he'll be more inclined to accept a deal that gives him a larger portion, even if it's still less than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer.  Even though my share is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, the inflation is making the money worth less and less with each passing round.  It's better to take something now than risk getting nothing in the end."
