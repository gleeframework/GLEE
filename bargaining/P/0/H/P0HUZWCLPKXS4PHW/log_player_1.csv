"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money I gain is still worth 600,000, but the money Bob gains is worth 500,000 * 0.8 = 400,000.

I'll reject this offer since I can get a better deal. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer and now it's my turn again, I'll make a new proposal. I'll try to get a better deal than the previous offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
