Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. Let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to go.  Accept this, and we both get a decent share.  Reject, and we'll continue this game, but with inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
