"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I propose a 900k / 100k split. This seems like a fair starting point considering Bob's money depreciates much faster than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While I understand the inflation dynamic is affecting Bob's gains more significantly, a 300,000/700,000 split is too drastic a shift from the previous round.  I believe a more equitable solution can be reached."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000} 
```

I propose a 750k/250k split.  I'm willing to compromise, but still need to ensure a larger share to account for the lower rate of inflation on my end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer reflects the significant impact of inflation on his gains, I'm still not satisfied with the disparity. I need a better share to account for the continued devaluation of my earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000} 
```

I propose a 650k/350k split. I'm willing to continue compromising to reach a solution, but need to maintain a significant share due to the ongoing inflation affecting my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with the 450k/550k split, the continued inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me.  Accepting this offer seems like the best way to secure something before the value drops even further."
