"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose that I take 900,000 dollars and Bob gets 100,000 dollars.  This gives me a big advantage, but it also gives Bob a decent amount to potentially agree to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

This is a much better offer for Bob, but it still doesn't feel like a fair split.  I'm hoping for a more equitable distribution in the next round."
