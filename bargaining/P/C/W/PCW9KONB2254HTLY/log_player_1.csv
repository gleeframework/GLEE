"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial $10,000. This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but it's a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5000
* Bob gain: $5000

I think Bob's offer is a reasonable one, and splitting it evenly is a fair way to start. I'll accept this offer.
