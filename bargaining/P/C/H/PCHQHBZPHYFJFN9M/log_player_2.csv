"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $70, you take $30.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing later. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's early in the game and there's no guarantee Alice won't try to take more later.  I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more fairly.  Let's each take half and call it a day.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Time is literally money in this game, and it's your money that's losing value fastest. I'm offering you $35 which is more than the $27.5 you'd be left with after another rejection. Take the deal while it's still good! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not convinced Alice won't try to take even more later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 45,

  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to split the money fairly.  Let's meet in the middle and avoid further losses due to inflation.""
