Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and the inflation is significantly impacting the value of her share. While her offer isn't terrible in the face of the dwindling pot, there's a high chance she'll be forced to offer even more in the next round to avoid walking away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  The inflation is only getting worse for you Alice.""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While I could push for a slightly larger share,  offering a 50/50 split at this point sends a strong message: 
* **Fairness:** It demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise and recognize that dragging this out further is detrimental to both of us.
* **Urgency:**  Alice knows the clock is ticking and every round makes her potential share less appealing. 

This offer puts the ball firmly in her court and increases the chances of her accepting a reasonable deal before the inflation eats away at her potential winnings even more."
