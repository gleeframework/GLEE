"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a 4:1 ratio, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% reduction in value due to inflation, my gain of $6,000 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the previous round, which is $4,800.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I was initially looking for a 4:1 ratio and this is more like a 3:2 ratio. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
