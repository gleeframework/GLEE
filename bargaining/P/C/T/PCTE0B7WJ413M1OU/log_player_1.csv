"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is a fair, but slightly greedy offer. I'm taking a bigger share, but still giving Bob something to incentivize him to accept. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's not worth risking getting nothing at all. Accepting this offer secures me a decent amount of money, even with the inflation affecting my gain."
