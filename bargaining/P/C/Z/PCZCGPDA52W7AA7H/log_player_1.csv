"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want more for myself 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to make a counteroffer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly more generous share, but I'm still prioritizing my own gain. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of the cash, but you can have a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite lopsided! The reduced value of the money due to inflation makes it even harder to swallow.

I'll reject Bob's offer again. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially considering the reduced value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll think carefully about my next move, trying to find a balance between being fair and getting a decent share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game is getting intense! Since the money is worth even less than before, I'll have to be strategic. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, giving Bob a slightly larger share while still getting a decent chunk for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
