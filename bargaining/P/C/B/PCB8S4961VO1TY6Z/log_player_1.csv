Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to secure a large portion of the money. I figure Bob might accept, given the risk of losing it all if we go through all 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best choice. I've lost 10% of the value of my potential earnings due to inflation, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to secure a better deal in future rounds. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
