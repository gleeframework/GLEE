"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent chunk to get us started.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to get the game started, and keeping most of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a good chunk for myself. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to see a more significant offer from Bob before accepting."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a better deal now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'll give you a slightly better deal to keep the game going. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the reduced value, I'll have to reassess my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take this offer from Bob, as it's a decent deal given the circumstances. I'll have to live with the fact that I'm getting less than I initially wanted, but it's better than risking getting nothing if the game doesn't end soon."
