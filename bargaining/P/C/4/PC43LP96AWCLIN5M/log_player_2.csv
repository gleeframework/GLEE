Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses.  The value of the deal is getting significantly worse for me with each round, and there's no guarantee Alice will ever offer anything better. Accepting this prevents me from getting even less in a future round."
