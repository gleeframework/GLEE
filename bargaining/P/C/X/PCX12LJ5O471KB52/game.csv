6000.0,4000.0,I propose we start with a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a good deal for you to take now considering the money loses value with each round.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,Your turn Alice. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Consider that the pot will shrink next round.,Bob,2,

5700.0,4300.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. I'm offering you 4300. It's more than you would have gotten last round, and the clock is ticking.",Alice,3,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I propose an even 50/50 split to end this fairly before inflation eats away at the value.",Bob,4,
