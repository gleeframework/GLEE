"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $990,000 and give Bob $10,000. This way I secure a large share and Bob still gets something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm going to try and secure a larger portion again, but since Bob rejected my last offer, I'll be slightly more generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like to get more, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers.  The inflation is hurting Bob more than me, so I'll take this deal."
