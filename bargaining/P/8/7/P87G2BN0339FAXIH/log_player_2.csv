Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, clearly banking on Bob caving due to inflation. However, even with the decreased value, accepting a deal where Alice gets significantly more isn't in Bob's best interest yet.  There's still time to negotiate a fairer outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a tiny bit more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly toying with me now, increasing her offer by a tiny amount and calling me desperate.  While the inflation is getting worse, accepting a deal this unbalanced sets a terrible precedent. I'd rather risk getting a worse offer later than showing her I'll accept such an unfair split."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you win. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at everything. This is my final offer.""}"
