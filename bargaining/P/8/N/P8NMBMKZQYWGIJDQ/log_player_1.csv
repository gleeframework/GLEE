"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'll take 6000$ and leave 4000$ for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal this round! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 3000$ is now worth 80% of its original value, which is 2400$. Bob's gain of 7000$ remains the same as in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not proceed to the next round if I can get a better deal now.
