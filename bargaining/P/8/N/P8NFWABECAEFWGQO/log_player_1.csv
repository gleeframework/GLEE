"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm inviting Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I deserve only 40% of the remaining 100$ after the first round. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the first round, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering 55% of the remaining 100$, hoping that Bob will accept this slightly more favorable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I think I can do better than that 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns with the same offer as before, but the money is now worth even less for him due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer this time, as I don't want to risk losing even more value with each passing round. I'll take 45% of the remaining 100$."
