"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can give me 60, it's a good deal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I need to get a larger share to account for the decrease in value.

I'm not sure if 40 is enough, but I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting a worse deal in the next round. I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
