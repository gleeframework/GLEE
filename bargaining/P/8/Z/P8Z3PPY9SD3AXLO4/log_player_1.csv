I'm being a little greedy in the first round, but I want to see if Bob will accept a small amount. Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, 4500 is a decent gain considering Bob's offer. It's better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
