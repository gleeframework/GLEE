"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. We can negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $3,200.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I think I can do better than a 40% share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round, which is $5,120.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 7:3 is a more reasonable split given the current situation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $7,000 and Bob receives $3,000."
