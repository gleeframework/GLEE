"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 900,000$ - 100,000$ split in my favor. It's a fair starting point considering the potential inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  My share is worth less due to inflation, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round."
