"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a fair chance to counteroffer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, in the hopes that he will counteroffer and we can negotiate a better deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $60 is actually worth $48 (80% of 60).

I'm not too happy with this offer, but I think it's a bit better than my previous offer. I'll accept it for now.
