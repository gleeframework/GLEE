"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to keep you motivated to negotiate!""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can start negotiating from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split is the most logical way to divide the money.  It's in our best interest to reach an agreement quickly before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is indeed a fair proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. Considering the inflation, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I like the 50/50 idea, but I think I can do better. Let's make it 55/45 in my favor.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 5% inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreased value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this round. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're wasting time with these back-and-forth offers.  Let's both acknowledge that inflation is working against us. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this round, but I need to ensure I get a fair return for my time.  Let's settle this quickly before the value of the money drops further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive in his proposal. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with giving him a larger share, especially considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving you the larger share. I'd like to propose a compromise: let's meet in the middle at 52.5/47.5.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair share. This offer is my last concession before I start to get aggressive.""
}
