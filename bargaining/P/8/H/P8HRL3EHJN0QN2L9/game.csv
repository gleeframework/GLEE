5500.0,4500.0,"I appreciate your proposal for a 50/50 split, Bob. However, considering the inflation working against you, I think this revised offer is more beneficial in the long run. Let's close the deal!",Alice,3,

5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here. This offer acknowledges the inflation factor while still giving you a reasonable share. Time is running out - let's agree and secure our gains.",Alice,5,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, we need to be more realistic about the inflation.  This offer is a fair compromise, considering the devaluation of my share. Let's reach an agreement before it's too late.",Bob,6,
