"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. I'm willing to be generous, but let's make it a little more equitable. How about this?"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding Inflation:**  The key here is the differential inflation. Alice's share loses value faster than Bob's with each round. This means time is on Bob's side.
* **Not Too Greedy:** While Bob could hold out for an even better deal, being too greedy might make Alice dig in her heels. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the need for a somewhat fair split while still giving Bob a better position. 
* **Future Leverage:** Rejecting Alice's first offer gives Bob a stronger position in subsequent rounds. Alice is now aware that Bob won't simply accept a bad deal."
