"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering Bob a small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced my potential gain by 20% again, I'll aim to get a better share this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain! I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round, and this offer is relatively close to what I was hoping for in earlier rounds."
