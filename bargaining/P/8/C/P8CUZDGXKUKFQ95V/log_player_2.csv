"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, it's now worth $8,000.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less for me and 19% less for Alice, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $5500 / 0.64 (since 100% - 36% = 64%) = $8593.75
* Alice's gain: $4500 / 0.81 (since 100% - 19% = 81%) = $5555.56

My offer is actually more favorable for me than Alice's, but I'll consider it.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less for me and 19% less for Alice, the actual amounts are:

* Alice's gain: $4000 / 0.81 = $4944.44

Here's my new offer:
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

# Bob gain: 6000

* My gain: $6000 / 0.406 (since 100% - 59.04% = 40.96%) = $14706.22
* Alice's gain: $4000 / 0.65561 (since 100% - 34.39% = 65.61%) = $6107.21

This is a very generous offer from Alice, considering the inflation. I'll accept it.
