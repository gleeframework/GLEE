I'm going for a generous but not too risky offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is incredibly unfair, and I won't accept it! I know he's likely hoping I'll cave due to the inflation, but I'm willing to take the risk."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but still enough that it might be tempting.  Inflation is starting to bite, but I still want to show I'm willing to negotiate."

Bob's offer is still ridiculously skewed in his favor. I'm not going to accept it. While the inflation is a factor, I'm still willing to take the risk and see if we can reach a fairer agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm reducing my share further to try and incentivize Bob to accept. He's been stubborn so far, but I'm hoping he'll start to feel the pressure of the shrinking rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

We're getting down to the wire, so I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share. However, I'm still aiming for a majority share, as I believe it's a fair deal considering the circumstances."

Round 10

```

Bob's offer is still way too low. Even with the inflation, I'm not going to accept a deal where I'm getting less than 40% of the money.  We're almost out of time, but I'm not giving up."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}

This is my final offer. I'm taking a significant hit from inflation, but I'm still offering Bob a decent share. If he rejects this, we both lose everything.  It's time for him to be reasonable."

This is a tough one. Even though it's still not ideal, I'm accepting Bob's offer. We're down to the last round and I'd rather have something than nothing. I'm hoping he'll be more reasonable next time if we have another chance!"
