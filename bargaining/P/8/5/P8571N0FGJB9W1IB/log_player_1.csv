"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started, take the $1000 and we can negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no need for further negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $9,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's now worth $8,100. And Bob's gain of $1,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's now worth $800.

Bob's new offer is to split it down the middle, which means I would get $5,000 and Bob would get $5,000. I'm not sure if it's the best option, but I'm willing to consider it.
