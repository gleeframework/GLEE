"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need for games! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the game's current state
We are in Round 3 of the game. The money's value decreases by 10% with each round. In the previous rounds, I offered a 60-40 split, which Bob rejected, and then Bob offered a 50-50 split, which I rejected.

### Step 2: Determine the current value of the money
Since we are in Round 3 and the money's value decreases by 10% each round, the current value of the $100 is 90% of its original value in Round 2 and 81% of its original value from Round 1. So, the $100 is now worth $81 in terms of its original purchasing power.

### Step 3: Formulate a new offer
Considering the decreasing value of the money and aiming to find a mutually acceptable split, I should propose a division that is closer to the 50-50 split Bob previously offered but still slightly in my favor, given that I'm making the offer and we're under time pressure due to the limited rounds and inflation.

### Step 4: Decide on the specifics of the offer
I will offer myself 55% of the $100 and offer Bob 45%. This split is closer to the even split Bob suggested but still recognizes my initiative in making the offer.

### Step 5: Attach a message to the offer
The message should convey a sense of compromise and urgency, considering the decreasing value of the money and the limited number of rounds left.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Compromise before it's too late!""}"
