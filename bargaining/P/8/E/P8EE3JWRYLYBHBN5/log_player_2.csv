We're getting into the later rounds, but I'm holding out for a better split. Accepting anything less than 5000 at this stage would be a bad move."

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one! It's tempting to take $4500, but there's only three rounds left. I'm betting Alice is getting very nervous now and will offer a better deal.  I need to hold strong."

# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle of our last offers, 54-46, and that's it 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's risky, but this is the best I'm likely to get. If I reject this, Alice might dig in her heels and I'll end up with nothing. It's better to take a smaller share than risk losing it all."
