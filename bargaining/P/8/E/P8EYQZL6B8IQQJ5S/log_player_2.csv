"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 7500, I'll try to counter with a slightly lower amount for her. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 3000, ""alice_gain"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, Alice's offer is actually a more significant percentage of the remaining total. I'll accept this offer to get a slightly larger share.
