Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This way we both benefit from this game. Keep in mind that the value of the money decreases with each round.

# Alice gain: 6000

""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be a little more equitable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Remember, the value decreases each round for both of us, so a quick agreement benefits us both.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like we both want to be efficient with this diminishing value. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. It's closer to the middle ground, and given the inflation, it's better for both of us to settle now rather than lose more in another round. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
