Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly, giving you $40 and myself $60.  We both get a better deal than your previous offer, and we can avoid the inflation taking a bigger bite out of our share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
