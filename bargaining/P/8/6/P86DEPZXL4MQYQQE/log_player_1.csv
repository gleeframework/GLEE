"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
This is a 50-50 split, a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to get the better end of the deal! I'll have to think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a counteroffer to Bob. Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```
This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
