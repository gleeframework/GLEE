"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in not risking more rounds and accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, let's take it! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as keen on the offer as I was before. However, it's still a decent split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and not leaving too much on the table, considering the effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money I gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll have to be more careful with my decisions from now on.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4. It's not the best deal, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value."
