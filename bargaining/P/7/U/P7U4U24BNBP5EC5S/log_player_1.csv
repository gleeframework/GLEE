"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a very lopsided split, giving Bob a single dollar.  Since he gets 10% less value each round, this might seem like a bad deal, but I'm hoping he'll accept it rather than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is a significant improvement over the previous round.  Given the inflation, if I reject this offer, I risk getting nothing in the next round.  It's a better outcome for me overall."
