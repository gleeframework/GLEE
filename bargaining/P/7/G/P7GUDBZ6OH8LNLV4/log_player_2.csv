Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting, need a better share! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now, and her offers are getting worse for her. While she's focused on getting a larger share upfront, I can hold out for a better deal in the later rounds.  I need to start pushing for a more favorable split soon though, as time is also running out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""The tables have turned, Alice! It's time to consider a deal that reflects the current value.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to become more assertive. Alice is getting desperate due to the inflation heavily impacting her potential gains. This is the round to push for a  favorable split before she gets truly desperate and offers even less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting desperate, but still want a fair share! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the heat of inflation, but her offer is still unacceptable. It seems she is overvaluing the initial proposed fairness. My offer in the previous round was strategically better for her considering the inflation, yet she rejected it. I'll hold out for a better deal, she'll likely be more agreeable soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This offer benefits us both, considering the circumstances. Time is running out!""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand slightly, as Alice's desperation is growing, and we're running out of time. It's a gamble, but the pressure is on her to accept a deal that still benefits her, even if it's less than what she initially aimed for. My offer provides a significant edge considering the inflation, and it might be her last chance for a reasonably ""fair"" outcome."
