"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but with a slight bias towards my gain. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still a 60/40 split, which is a pretty reasonable offer. Considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I'll accept this offer to get some money now rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
