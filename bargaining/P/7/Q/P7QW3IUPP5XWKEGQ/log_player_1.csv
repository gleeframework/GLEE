"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a little too greedy for me, Alice. Let's split the difference and I'll take a slightly larger share this time.  We can wrap this up quickly and the money will be worth more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
