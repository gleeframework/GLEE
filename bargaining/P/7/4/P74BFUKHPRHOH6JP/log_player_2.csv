"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal.  I'll take the bigger share, but you still get a good chunk of the money.  Let's see if we can work together to get this done quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to see what Alice's next offer is, as the value of the money will decrease significantly for her if she doesn't accept in the next round.  I'm hoping she'll get more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  I'm offering you 40% of the money, and I'll take 60%. We can get this done quickly and both walk away with a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand you want more. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to 650,000, but that's my final offer.  It's still a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid losing more money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Alice's next offer will be worse for me due to inflation, and her offer is still a reasonable amount. It's better to get something now than risk getting nothing later."
