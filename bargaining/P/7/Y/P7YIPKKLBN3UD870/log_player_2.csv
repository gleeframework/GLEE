Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll, I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting. My initial instinct is to try to get a better deal, but I don't want to risk getting nothing. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll accept this offer.
