"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000$ for myself and giving Bob 100,000$. I'm aiming for a fair but advantageous start, leaving room for negotiation if Bob chooses to counter-propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share to 800,000$ and increasing Bob's to 200,000$. This is a more even split, but still gives me a significant majority. I'm hoping to find a compromise that avoids further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob is offering a more even split than in the previous round, I'm not willing to settle for 200,000$ at this stage. I'm still aiming for a much larger share, and I believe there's still room for a better deal. The inflation is hurting Bob more than me, and I will use this to my advantage in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm further decreasing my share to 700,000$ and increasing Bob's to 300,000$. This is a more balanced offer, but I'm still aiming for a majority. I believe this offer is fair, considering Bob's diminishing share due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is starting to get close to a more balanced split, I'm still not convinced. The inflation is significantly impacting Bob's potential gains, and I believe I can still secure a larger share. I'm confident that I can negotiate a more favorable deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

With inflation heavily impacting Bob, I'm decreasing my share further to 600,000$ and increasing Bob's to 400,000$. This is a significant move toward a more equal split, but I still maintain a larger share. I believe this is a fair offer given the circumstances and hope to reach an agreement before further inflation erodes Bob's gains."
