"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, given that I'm going to be affected by the inflation more heavily. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, it's clear that Bob is leveraging the inflation to his advantage. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure at least *some* money."
