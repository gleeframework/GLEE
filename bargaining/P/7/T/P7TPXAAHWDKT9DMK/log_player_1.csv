"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small amount, hoping to get the game over quickly. I'm confident I can get a better deal in later rounds if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair, and I'm not going to settle for such a small amount. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept, as the inflation will continue to reduce the value of his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer. While the inflation is hitting Bob harder, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm again increasing my offer, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. The inflation is starting to hurt, but I believe it will hurt Bob more, making him more likely to accept a less-than-ideal deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfair, even though the inflation is starting to affect me. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm making a final push to secure a good share of the money. I'm reducing my offer a bit further, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that the inflation is hurting him significantly now and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unfavorable.  The inflation is definitely starting to bite into my potential gains, but I'm willing to risk another round to try and get a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm realizing that the inflation is impacting both of us significantly. I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will see the logic and accept to avoid getting nothing."
