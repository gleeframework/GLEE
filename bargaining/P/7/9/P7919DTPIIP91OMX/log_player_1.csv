"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose to take almost all of the money, leaving Bob with only $1.  It's a risky move, but since I'm the first to propose, I want to see if Bob will be willing to accept such a small amount in the hopes of getting more in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is completely unfair! I'll reject it and try to negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'll propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer, and I hope Bob will accept it. The inflation is starting to hit, and we need to reach an agreement soon."
