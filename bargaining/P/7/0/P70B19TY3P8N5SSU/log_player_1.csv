I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly and avoid the effects of inflation.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very greedy! I'm going to reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round. I still have a good chance of getting a better deal, especially since the inflation will hit him harder in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a good chunk of the money, but I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the inflation and Bob's greed.  I think a 80/20 split is still fair considering the circumstances, and hopefully Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept before the inflation really hits him hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than before!  He's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. I still have time to negotiate, and the inflation is going to make his position even more difficult."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money. The inflation is biting hard, but I'm hoping that Bob will realize it's better to accept a fair deal than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round! While I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  I'm going to keep pushing for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm still hoping to secure a decent share of the money. The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I need to find a way to convince Bob that a 60/40 split is the best he's going to get before it's too late for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm feeling the impact of inflation, I'm not going to give in yet.  I'm determined to get a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're running out of time, and the inflation is really hurting now. I'm offering an even split, hoping that Bob will finally see reason and accept before we both lose everything. This might be the only way to salvage something from this situation."
