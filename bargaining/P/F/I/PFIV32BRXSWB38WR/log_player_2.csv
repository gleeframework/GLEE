"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be efficient, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Alice. It's a fair deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair deal, Bob, but time is money. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a 50/50 split, it's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all.  Inflation is a factor, and this offer is still better than what I would get if I continue to reject offers."
