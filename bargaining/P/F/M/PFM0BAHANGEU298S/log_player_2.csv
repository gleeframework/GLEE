Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have accepted my previous offers, now I'll take even more 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the $3000 now.  The inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and it's likely to continue if we go to another round."
