Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd rather take the risk, it's still better for me 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, but it's still not a good deal for Bob. While Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, she's clearly overestimating the ""risk"" at this stage. Bob can likely secure a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and it's hurting you more than me. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to turn up the heat and apply pressure.  

* **Deadline Pressure:** By framing this as a ""final offer,"" Bob introduces a sense of urgency.
* **Shifting Power Dynamics:**  Alice is now the one facing a losing scenario if the game continues.
* **Strategic Concession:** Bob shows flexibility by slightly increasing Alice's share from his previous offer, making it seem like a difficult concession on his part.

This offer aims to make Alice realize that accepting a less favorable deal now is better than risking an even worse outcome later."
