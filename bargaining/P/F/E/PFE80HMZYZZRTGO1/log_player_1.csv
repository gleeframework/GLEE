I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  I figure Bob is likely to reject it, but it sets the stage for me to get a much better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll take it! It's a much fairer deal than the last one, and I'm not sure I'd do better in the next round with inflation kicking in."
