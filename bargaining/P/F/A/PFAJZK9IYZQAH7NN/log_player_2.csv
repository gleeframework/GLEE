Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $9,000, you take $1,000.  The money will be worth less with each round, especially for you Bob!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  You're losing value every round.  I'll take $7,000, you take $3,000. This is a better deal than you'll see in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000
