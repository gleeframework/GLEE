,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable: I propose a 60/40 split. Think carefully, the money will be worth less next round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  You're losing value every round.  I'll take $7,000, you take $3,000. This is a better deal than you'll see in later rounds.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly. Take it before inflation eats away at any potential gains for both of us.",Bob,4,
