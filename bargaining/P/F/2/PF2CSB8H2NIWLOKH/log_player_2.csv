"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's far too lopsided. I'm going to play this strategically and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I propose a fairer split. You get a decent amount, and I get the majority. Let's get this over with!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  Take it, or we both lose more money in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, Alice's offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point. The inflation is hurting her more than me, so I'm willing to accept a less favorable deal to avoid further losses."
