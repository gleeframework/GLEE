"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fairer reflection of the inflation we're facing. Let's work together and get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is heavily skewed in Bob's favor, especially with the inflation. Let's see if he's open to a more reasonable split in the next round.
