Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 70/30 this time.

# Alice gain: 7000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced by your threats, Bob.  Let's meet in the middle, 65/35. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, but Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate.  While not ideal, getting closer to a 50/50 split is crucial. Accepting now would mean losing a significant amount of the potential gain due to inflation, and I believe I can pressure Alice further in the remaining rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  The inflation is eating into potential gains with every round.  A firm 50/50 offer establishes a strong position and  gives Alice a clear choice â€“ accept a fair deal or risk losing everything as time runs out."
