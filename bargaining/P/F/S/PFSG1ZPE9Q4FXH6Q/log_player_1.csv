{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a high offer, I'm trying to balance it out. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and 30% for me is too low. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split is fair""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise after Bob's initial offer and my rejection of his subsequent offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and 45% for me is still too low. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm starting to feel like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal."

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but not too much""}

I'm proposing a 52/48 split, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division. I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and still getting a fair share for myself."
