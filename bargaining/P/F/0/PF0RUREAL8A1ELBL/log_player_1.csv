Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us, but especially for me. It's crucial to reach an agreement soon.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm offering slightly less than in Round 1, but it's still a better deal for Bob than his Round 2 proposal (considering the inflation).  
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping to add weight to the proposal and push Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a risk. This is my counter. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Desperate Times:** The value of the money is plummeting. Taking Bob's offer now is better than risking another round where the money will be worth even less. 
* **No Leverage:** I stated my previous offer was my final one. Continuing to negotiate might lead to even worse outcomes as Bob knows I'm running out of options.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** While not ideal, this offer still provides me with some gains. Holding out any longer might result in an even more unfavorable split or even no agreement at all."
