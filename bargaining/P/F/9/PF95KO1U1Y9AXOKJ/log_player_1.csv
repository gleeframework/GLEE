"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, leaving me with $8,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  I propose we split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain would be 20% less than $8,000, which is $6,400.

Bob's offer is $5,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again due to inflation, my gain would be 20% less than $6,400, which is $5,120.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but still a relatively small amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to move a little closer to your offer.  Let's split it 4500/5500.  This is a fair compromise, and we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less due to inflation, my gain would be 48.8% less than $8,000, which is $4,096.

Bob's offer is $5,500, which is a significant increase from his previous offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll consider it, but I'm not ready to accept just yet.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 48.8% less than the original amount, my gain would be 48.8% less than $6,400, which is $3,299.68.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a bold move, Bob. I think I deserve a bigger share. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's try to be reasonable.  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but we need to find a compromise.  How about we split it 4000/6000? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 67.23% less than the original amount, my gain would be 67.23% less than $6,400, which is $2,102.32.

Bob's offer is $6,000, which is a significant increase from his previous offer. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the inflation rate is getting higher and my gain is decreasing rapidly. However, $6,000 is still a decent amount, and I might not get a better offer later.
