This is a classic illustration of game theory principles, particularly resembling the ultimatum game. While I could try to push for a slightly better outcome in further rounds, Bob's offer is fair and ensures I don't walk away with nothing if he decides to play aggressively in subsequent rounds. Accepting a sure $500,000 is a rational choice."
