"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\n### \n\nI made a generous offer considering the inflation impact, where I, Alice, get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This division allows both of us to walk away with a substantial amount, considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. The message emphasizes fairness and the mutual benefit of accepting this offer early on to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a better split for us, considering our respective inflation rates. Let's move forward! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation impact, accepting 40% of the now devalued amount seems less favorable than attempting to negotiate for a larger share in subsequent rounds. The difference in inflation rates between us (5% for me and 10% for Bob) could provide leverage for a more advantageous offer in the future. Additionally, accepting this early in the game might not maximize my potential gain, considering we have up to 12 rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This is a more realistic split, given the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer slightly, decreasing my share to $580,000 and increasing Bob's to $420,000. The message aims to reinforce the fairness of this division, taking into account the impact of inflation on both our potential gains. By framing it as a ""more realistic split,"" I'm attempting to persuade Bob that this offer is reasonable and worth accepting before further devaluation occurs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's try to be fair. I'm offering 580k for me and 420k for you, taking inflation into account. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer in Round 4 because, despite his message emphasizing compromise and fairness, the offer itself mirrors the split I proposed in Round 3 but reversed in our favor. Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on Bob's share, I believe there's room for further negotiation that could result in a more favorable split for me. Additionally, accepting this offer doesn't take full advantage of the stronger negotiating position the differing inflation rates provide me. With several rounds remaining, I'm inclined to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 560000, ""bob_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting us both, but I'm willing to find a middle ground. This split considers the devaluation impact on both our shares.""}\n\n###\n\nIn Round 5, I've adjusted my offer again, this time decreasing my share to $560,000 and increasing Bob's to $440,000. The message acknowledges the mutual impact of inflation and positions this offer as a compromise, emphasizing the search for a middle ground. By explicitly mentioning the devaluation's effect on both our shares, I aim to convey a sense of shared adversity and reasonableness in the proposed split, hoping to persuade Bob that this is a fair and acceptable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 560k-440k split, mirroring your previous offer but adjusting for inflation. Let's reach a compromise before things get worse! 
# Alice gain: 440000 
# Bob gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer in Round 6 because, similar to Round 4, he's mirroring my previous offer but not providing a more favorable split for me. Despite the increasing urgency due to inflation, with the money being worth significantly less for both of us, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message emphasizes reaching a compromise, but the offer itself doesn't demonstrate a willingness to meet in the middle in a way that benefits me. Given the disparity in how inflation affects our shares, I'm inclined to continue negotiating for a better deal, especially since we're only halfway through the available rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 540000, ""bob_gain"": 460000, ""message"": ""We're both losing value rapidly. This split is more than fair, considering the inflation difference between us. Let's end this before it's too late.""}\n\n###\n\nIn Round 7, I've adjusted my offer again, decreasing my share to $540,000 and increasing Bob's to $460,000. The message emphasizes the urgency of the situation, highlighting the rapid loss of value for both of us. By framing this offer as ""more than fair"" and considering the inflation difference, I aim to pressure Bob into accepting, implying that further negotiation could lead to a worse outcome for both parties. This approach seeks to balance the need for a favorable split with the increasing risk of walking away with significantly less if we fail to reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a 540k-460k split. This takes inflation into account and offers a fair outcome for both of us. It's time to end this before we lose even more! 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer in Round 8 because, despite his message emphasizing the need to end the negotiations to avoid further loss, the offer itself is simply mirroring my previous proposal but with the amounts reversed in our favor. At this stage, with the money worth significantly less for both of us, I'm looking for an offer that genuinely reflects the urgency and the disproportionate impact of inflation on Bob's share. Since we still have a few rounds left, I'm inclined to push for a better deal, hoping that the increasing pressure of potential total loss will prompt Bob to offer a more favorable split. The fact that Bob is now open to the split I previously proposed suggests he may be willing to compromise further as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""We're running out of time and value. This is a final compromise, considering the heavy inflation impact on both of us. Accepting now is better than risking further devaluation.""}\n\n###\n\nIn Round 9, I've adjusted my offer to $520,000 for myself and $480,000 for Bob, further narrowing the gap in an attempt to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. The message is more urgent, emphasizing that we're running out of time and that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us. By framing this as a ""final compromise,"" I aim to convey that I'm willing to settle but am not open to further concessions. The goal is to persuade Bob that accepting this offer is the best choice, given the risk of ending up with significantly less or even nothing if we fail to agree within the remaining rounds. The pressure of the game's end and the severe impact of inflation on Bob's share are key factors in hoping he'll accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing ground, let's end this now. I'm offering a 520k-480k split, reflecting your offer and acknowledging the current inflation. Let's finalize this before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI accept Bob's offer in Round 10 because, at this stage, the offer mirrors my previous proposal but with the amounts reversed in our favor, similar to previous rounds. However, considering the significant loss of value for both of us due to inflation and the risk of walking away with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the next two rounds, I believe accepting this offer is the most prudent decision. The fact that Bob has matched my previous offer suggests a willingness to meet in the middle, and the message emphasizes the urgency of the situation, indicating a genuine desire to conclude the negotiations. Given the circumstances, accepting $480,000, despite it being less than my initial proposals, seems like the best outcome to ensure a substantial gain, albeit reduced by inflation, rather than risking a total loss."
