"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting my proposal and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm willing to split the money 55/45 in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation. Accept this, and we can avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. I'm not thrilled about giving him 55% of the money, but I'm willing to compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the money 50/50. No more negotiations needed!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering we've already had a chance to negotiate."
