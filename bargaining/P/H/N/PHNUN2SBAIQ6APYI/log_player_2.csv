"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our previous offers? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

* **Alice's position weakening:** Inflation is hitting Alice harder each round. While she's aiming for the middle ground, her urgency to secure a deal is increasing.
* **Decent offer:** While not ideal, getting $4200 is a reasonable sum. Waiting longer might force Alice to make a less appealing offer due to inflation, or she might accept a worse deal in a later round out of desperation."
