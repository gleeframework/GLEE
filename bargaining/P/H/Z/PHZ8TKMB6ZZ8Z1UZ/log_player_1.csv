 I'm going to offer Bob a small amount to start. I figure he's likely to be greedy and want more, so this will get the ball rolling and give me a chance to see how he plays."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is fair, and while the money is worth less now due to inflation, I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better deal.  It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing!"
