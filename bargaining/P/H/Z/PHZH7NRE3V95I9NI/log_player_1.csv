Let's see how Bob responds to this fair offer!  I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money, but I'm also aware of the inflation risk.  Let's see if Bob is willing to split the money fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than the first round, even with the inflation.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to propose an even split. Since I'm aware of the inflation, I'm hoping Bob will understand that it's in his best interest to accept this offer.  An even split is fair, and it avoids the risk of both of us losing money due to inflation."
