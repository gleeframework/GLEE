Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real. This money loses value fast, especially for you. I'll take a little more this time, but it's a deal that lets us both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
