"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority but still leave you with a decent chunk.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. I'll have to prioritize getting a better deal in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. I'll give you a decent chunk, but not as much as you're asking for.""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you most of the money, but I need a bit more for myself to account for the inflation 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the decreased value of the money, I'm going to have to be more aggressive in my negotiations. Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, but I'm willing to consider it.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer, but only because I think it's the best I can get at this point.
