"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me in the second round!

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's too generous for you, Bob! I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money is worth 10% less for me, but I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a move, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, but still with a slight bias towards me. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still not giving up too much! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to wear me down with his offers!

Considering the money is worth significantly less now, I'll try to be more aggressive in my decision. However, I'll still reject this offer since it's still heavily biased towards Bob. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're not giving up enough, Bob! I'm not backing down!""
}
```

I'll try to make a more competitive offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob! Take it or leave it, but I'm not backing down!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, but still with a bias towards me. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get more! 
# Alice gain: 28 
# Bob gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers!

Considering the money is worth significantly less now, I'll try to be more cautious and not give up too much. However, I'll also consider that we're running out of time and the money is worth less and less with each passing round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! I'm not giving in yet!""
}
```

I'll try to make a more competitive offer in the next round, but I'll also consider the fact that we're getting close to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the seventh round, the money is worth even less for me, but I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 38,
  ""bob_gain"": 62,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! Take it or leave it, but I'm not going to give up now!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, but still with a bias towards me. I'm trying to be more aggressive since we're running out of time, but I'm also trying to be realistic about the value of the money at this point. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
