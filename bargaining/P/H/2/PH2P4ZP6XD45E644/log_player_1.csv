"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. I'll give you 10% and keep 90%. You can do better in the next round if you don't like this.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but you can't have all the money. Next round, the money will be worth 80% of its current value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I need to adjust my calculations. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll consider the effective values as follows:

My gain: 400,000 / 0.9 = 444,444.44 (in ""inflation-adjusted"" dollars)
Bob's gain: 600,000 / 0.8 = 750,000 (in ""inflation-adjusted"" dollars)

I don't think I can do better than this offer, so I'll accept it.
