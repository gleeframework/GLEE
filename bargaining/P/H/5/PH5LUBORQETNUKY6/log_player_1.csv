Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I'm confident we can find a better solution for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal. While his offer is appealing, I think we can find a more balanced solution."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. This offer is a compromise that still provides a significant advantage for both of us considering the inflation.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  The money is losing value, and this way we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is rapidly losing value for both of us. Holding out for a better deal is increasingly risky.
* **Bob's Position:**  Bob is likely aware of the inflation and knows his initial offer is looking more attractive over time. He may be less likely to concede further.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable payout. Rejecting risks getting nothing if we can't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
