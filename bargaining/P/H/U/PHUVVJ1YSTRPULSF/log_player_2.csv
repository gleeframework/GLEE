Since the money is losing value for me, I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This gives you a decent share while acknowledging the inflation issue. Let's reach a compromise.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear you're feeling the pressure of the inflation. I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly to 65/35. This is my final offer. Accept it now, and we both walk away with something.  Reject it, and the value decreases for you again.

# Alice gain: 6500
