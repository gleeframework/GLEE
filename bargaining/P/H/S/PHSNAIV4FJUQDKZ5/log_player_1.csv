"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% of the total, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively generous offer, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40%, but I think I deserve more, so I'll try to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate further. I'll consider his offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give him 60% of the total.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll think of a counteroffer for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60% is still too much for you. I'll give you 30% this time.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think 45% is the maximum I'm willing to offer. Let's see if you'll accept this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to negotiate, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give him 55% of the total.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll think of a counteroffer for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less than before, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 40% is the maximum I'm willing to give. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or try to negotiate further!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet exactly in the middle. I'll give you 50% and take the rest. It's a fair split, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Meeting exactly in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, especially considering the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take 50% of the remaining $1,000,000."
