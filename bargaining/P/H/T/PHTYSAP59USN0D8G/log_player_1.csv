Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  The money will be worth less in the next rounds, so it's better to take it now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""I understand you want a fair deal, Bob, but this is time-sensitive. This offer still gives you a decent amount considering the inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split it closer to 50/50, but with a slight edge for you to account for inflation.  We don't want to lose too much money to the next round. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still early in the game. The inflation is hurting him significantly more than me. My goal is to secure at least 60% of the initial pot, and I'm willing to push a few more rounds to see if he concedes more."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6300,
""bob_gain"": 3700,
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! Let's be realistic - the clock is ticking and the money is losing value. This offer ensures you get something substantial.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to be flexible and split the difference, but I need something more reasonable.  Let's make this deal before the money loses even more value! 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is finally moving closer to a more acceptable split. While I would have preferred to get closer to 60%, his share is dwindling rapidly due to the high inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable amount now before it depreciates further. It's better to secure a decent win than risk getting nothing if we reach the final rounds."
