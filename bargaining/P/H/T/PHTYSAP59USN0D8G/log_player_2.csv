"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is good now, it's worth considering that the money will be worth less in future rounds.  It's worth seeing if Alice will offer a better deal in a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time.  The money will be worth less in the next rounds, so it's better to take it now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair deal, Bob, but this is time-sensitive. This offer still gives you a decent amount considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Alice's message is trying to pressure me, the offer is still not as good as the initial offer, and the inflation rate is working against me.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be flexible.  Let's split it closer to 50/50, but with a slight edge for you to account for inflation.  We don't want to lose too much money to the next round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close! Let's be realistic - the clock is ticking and the money is losing value. This offer ensures you get something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is trying to use pressure tactics, but the offer is getting worse for me.  I need to push for a better deal, as the inflation rate is significantly harming my potential gain."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  I'm willing to be flexible and split the difference, but I need something more reasonable.  Let's make this deal before the money loses even more value!""
