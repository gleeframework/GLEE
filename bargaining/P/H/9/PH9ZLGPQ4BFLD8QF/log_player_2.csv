"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, the inflation rates are going to make this deal much less favorable for me in the long run. I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split considering the inflation rates.  Let's get this done before things get worse for both of us!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation concerns, Bob. This offer still gives you a decent share while acknowledging it's my turn to propose. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher amount, considering the inflation, this is a decent offer. It's better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
