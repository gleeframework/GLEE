"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and simple offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, and I'm trying to get a better deal, I'll offer a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite skewed towards his gain! Given the inflation, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'll think about it for a moment...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 80-20, and I'm trying to get a better deal, I'll offer a more balanced split. Considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gains more significantly, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
