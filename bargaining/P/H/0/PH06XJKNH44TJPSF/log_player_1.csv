I'm going to propose a pretty lopsided split in my favor.  I figure Bob will be happy to get anything at all in the first round.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, it's better to be greedy early on!  Let's see what he says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty bad for me, even with inflation. I know he's probably trying to get the most he can, but I'm still going to reject this and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to take a more moderate approach this time.  I'm still going to try to get a good share, but I'll offer Bob a bit more than before.  I'm hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to take this deal before the inflation gets even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, my money is worth less than half of what it was in the first round, and Bob is offering me a pretty even split. This is probably the best deal I'm going to get, so I'm going to accept it."
