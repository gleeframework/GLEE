"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair and gives me a decent chunk of the money while still leaving Bob with a significant amount. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, I'm getting a smaller share than I initially proposed.

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a decent compromise and I'd rather take the smaller amount now than risk getting nothing at the end of the 12 rounds.
