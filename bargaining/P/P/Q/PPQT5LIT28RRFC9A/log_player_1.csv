"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to secure a large share early on, knowing the money will be worth less in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the inflation.  Accepting ensures I get something, and it's better than risking a worse offer in the next round."
