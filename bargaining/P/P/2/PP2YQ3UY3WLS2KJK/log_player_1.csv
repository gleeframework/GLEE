"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as needed""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed based on our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 6k is a fairer share for me 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 6k being a ""fairer share"" for Bob, but I'm willing to compromise.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
