"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me taking $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70% now, but I'll give you a chance to get a better deal later. Don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $285,000.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the initial offer was a 60-40 split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 90% of its original value now, so I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think I'm being too generous!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 54-46 split in my favor, with me taking $540,000 and leaving $460,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's call it a draw, I'll take 50% and we can walk away with a fair split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $427,700.

I think this is a reasonable offer, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. A 50-50 split seems fair, and it's better than continuing to negotiate.
