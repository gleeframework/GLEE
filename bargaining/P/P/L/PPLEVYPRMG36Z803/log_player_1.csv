Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation hit you're taking, I think I deserve a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it's painful to accept such a lopsided deal, the inflation is really hitting hard.  At this rate, continuing to reject offers will only mean I get a smaller and smaller share.  It's better to take what I can get now."
