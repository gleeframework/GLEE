This is a tough one!  While ideally, I'd like a better deal, here's why I'm accepting:

* **Time Pressure:** We're at round 6 out of 12.  The longer this goes on, the less either of us gets. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is hitting Bob harder, but it's still significantly impacting my potential gains too.
* **Bird in Hand:** A 50/50 split guarantees me something.  If I keep pushing, I risk getting nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement. 

It's a gamble either way, but at this point, accepting the 50/50 split feels like the most logical choice to avoid walking away empty-handed."
