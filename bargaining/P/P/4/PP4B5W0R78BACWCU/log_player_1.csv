Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair but reasonable offer to start. I'll see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share to get the money sooner.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and since we're dealing with inflation, it's better to take a 50/50 split now rather than risk getting less later."
