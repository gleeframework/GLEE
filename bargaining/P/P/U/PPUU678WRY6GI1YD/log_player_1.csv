"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll think it through.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking. With the current offer, I'd be getting $4000, which is worth 80% of the original $5000 I would have gotten in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob would be getting $6000, which is worth 120% of the original $5000 he would have gotten in the first round.

Considering the inflation factor, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still fair""}

I'm adjusting the split to 45/55 in my favor, hoping to get a better deal than the previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll think it through.

Considering the inflation factor, the offer is actually not as bad as it seems. The $3500 I'd get is worth about 70.4% of the original $5000 I would have gotten in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob would be getting $6500, which is worth about 130% of the original $5000 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'm getting a bit desperate, and the offer is still not great, but I think I can live with it. I'll accept this offer.
