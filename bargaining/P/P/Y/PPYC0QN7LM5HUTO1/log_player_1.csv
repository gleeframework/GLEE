"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a generous share, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. The money is still worth a lot, and I'm not willing to give up that much to Bob just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth 20% less than in round 2, so it's now worth 80% of the original amount. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 560000,
  ""bob_gain"": 440000
}

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share for myself and giving Bob a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value quickly!

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. The money is still worth a significant amount, but I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting even less. 520,000 is a decent share, and I think it's better than risking further inflation."
