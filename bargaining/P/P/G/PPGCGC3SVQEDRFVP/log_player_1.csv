"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a decent starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for Bob, his offer is actually a more significant share than it initially seems. I'll accept this offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
