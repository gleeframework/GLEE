"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob $40, which is a reasonable 40% of the total amount, and I will take $60. I believe this is a generous offer considering that the money's value decreases by 10% for Bob in each subsequent round. I am hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money's value decreases by 10% for Bob in each round, he will be more inclined to accept a lower offer in the next round. I am willing to take that risk to potentially get a higher share of the money.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! Here's my next offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Think about the inflation!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Think about the inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nI am making a slightly more aggressive offer this time, taking into account the fact that the money's value decreases by 10% for Bob in each round. Since Bob is under pressure to accept an offer before the money loses even more value, I believe he will be more inclined to accept this offer, which is still relatively fair but more in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly and end this before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer because I believe I can still get a better deal. Since the money's value has decreased by 27.1% for Bob, he is under even more pressure to accept an offer. I am willing to take the risk of continuing the game to try to get an even higher share of the money.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! Here's my next offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is on my side!""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is on my side!""}\n\n###\n\nI am making an even more aggressive offer this time, taking into account the significant decrease in the value of the money for Bob. With the money's value decreasing by 27.1% for Bob, I believe he will be desperate to accept an offer and end the game before his potential gains dwindle even further. I am trying to take advantage of this situation to get the highest possible share of the money.\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
