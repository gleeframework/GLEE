"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  I figure he might be willing to take a small share rather than risk getting nothing at all if we go to another round and the value of my share goes down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept the offer.  While it's less than I initially wanted, the inflation would make my share even smaller in the next round if I rejected this offer."
