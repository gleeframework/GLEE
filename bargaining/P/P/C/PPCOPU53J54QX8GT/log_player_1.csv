"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly larger share this round.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
