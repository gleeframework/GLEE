"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so my potential gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of $4000, which is $3600.

I'll reject this offer. My goal is to maximize my gain, and I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the inflation, my goal is to get as much as possible in terms of the initial value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 45%."
