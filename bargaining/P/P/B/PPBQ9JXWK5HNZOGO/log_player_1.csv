Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure most of the money early on. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Although I'd prefer to get more, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all."
