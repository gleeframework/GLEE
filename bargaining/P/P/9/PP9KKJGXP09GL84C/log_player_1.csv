"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm curious to see what Bob will propose in response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,750 (95% of $5,000).

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I think meeting in the middle is a fair proposal, and I'm willing to take $4,750."
