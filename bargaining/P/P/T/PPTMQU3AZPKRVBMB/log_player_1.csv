"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'm getting a relatively small share of the money. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, I'll take 50 and you can have 50. It's getting late, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we don't agree soon.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more aggressive move to try to get a better deal."
