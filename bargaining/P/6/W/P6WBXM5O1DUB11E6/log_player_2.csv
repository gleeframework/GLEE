"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60, you take 40. We can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 40/60 split seems fair, I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. There's a lot of time and potential for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more than your initial offer, but I think 55/45 is a fair split. We can still work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. 50/50 seems like a fair split, considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
The value of the money is decreasing, so even a 50/50 split is better than risking further negotiation and potential loss due to inflation."
