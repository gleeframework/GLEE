"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the original $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Still a good offer, but I'm not sure if I should take it.

I'll reject this offer for now and make a counteroffer in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```
This time, I'm offering Bob a bit less, but still a relatively fair share, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

Considering my gain of $45 is now worth only 72.9% of what it was in the first round, I'll think carefully about this offer.

After some thought, I'll accept this offer. At least I'll get something, and the game will be over.
