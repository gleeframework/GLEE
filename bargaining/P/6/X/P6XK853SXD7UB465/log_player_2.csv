Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was already generous considering the inflation. This offer is a compromise to settle before the value decreases further.  
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
