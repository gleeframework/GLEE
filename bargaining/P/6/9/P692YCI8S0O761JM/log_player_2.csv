Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split, Bob.  A little more for me to account for the faster inflation we're facing.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. This offer accounts for the inflation difference while still being fair. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but we need to act fast with this inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4650 
# Alice gain: 5350 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough one! Here's my reasoning:

* **Time Pressure:** We're over halfway through the rounds, and the deal is getting worse with each rejection.
* **Alice's Inflation:** Her money is losing value much faster than mine. This offer is likely the best I can get at this stage as she's feeling the pressure.
* **Greed vs. Loss:** Holding out for more might backfire, leaving us with nothing. It's better to secure a decent amount now. 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, the time pressure and her higher inflation rate make this offer acceptable.
