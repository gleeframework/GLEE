"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be realistic, Bob.  This gives you something, and avoids us both losing out to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer provides some money, it's a very small amount.  It's better to reject and see what Alice will offer next. The inflation is in my favor in this scenario, and with the rounds ticking down, she might be willing to make a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 950000,
""alice_gain"": 50000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split.  This gives us both a good foundation to work with.  Rejecting this could lead to more losses from inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's be serious. I'm taking a hit from inflation here.  This offer is more reasonable, but time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is slightly better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm still holding out for a more balanced division, and time is on my side as inflation hurts Alice's gains more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""This is a much fairer offer.  With each passing round, inflation is hurting Alice more, so it's in both our best interests to come to an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, or we both risk walking away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's message is getting more desperate, her offer is still not fair. I'm still in a better position than her with the inflation hitting her harder. I'll continue to push for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable. This offer is closer to a true split, and gives us both a substantial portion of the money.  Let's avoid the risk of getting nothing by accepting this.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  You're being incredibly greedy.  I'm taking another hit from inflation, and this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still too lopsided, and her threat of it being her final offer doesn't hold much weight. With inflation hitting her much harder than me, she's the one feeling the pressure more. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money, and time is running out. This offer gives you a fair share, and it's the closest we've been to an agreement. Let's accept this and avoid the risk of getting nothing at all.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is absolutely my final offer. You're being unbelievably stubborn. Take this deal or we both get NOTHING. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still not fair. I'm still in a much better position than her due to inflation, and her threats are becoming more desperate. With only a few rounds left, I'm going to hold out for a better deal. The risk of getting nothing is real, but so is the possibility of a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, with only a few rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is increasing. This offer is closer to a 50/50 split than we've seen before, and it gives us both a significant amount of money.  Let's be reasonable and avoid the potential for both of us to lose everything.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: BOB! We have ONE round left.  This is INSANE. I am taking a HUGE loss because of inflation. This is it.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only one round left, the risk of getting nothing is too high. Even though the offer is still not ideal, it's the best chance of securing a substantial amount of money.  Alice's desperation is evident, and the pressure of inflation is clearly weighing on her.  It's time to accept the offer and avoid the potential for both of us to walk away with nothing."
