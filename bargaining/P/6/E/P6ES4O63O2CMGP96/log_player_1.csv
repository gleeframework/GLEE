"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the bigger share this round""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm starting with a strong proposal, hoping to get a good deal early on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle this round 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing by 20% each round, I need to be strategic.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd rather not meet in the middle just yet. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm still the one making the offer""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but still trying to maintain the upper hand. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but it's still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to give up the majority share just yet. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now!

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a slight edge. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not willing to give up 70% of the remaining value. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is almost worthless at this point!

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this round, but I'm trying to get a decent deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm not sure if it's enough to convince him to accept. The value of money is decreasing so fast that I'm starting to think we should just split it 50/50 at this point..."
