"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation.  Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'm not thrilled with the 55/45 split, but I'll consider it. However, I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too lopsided for my taste. I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so I'll aim for a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60% is a fairer split, considering the inflation. Take it or leave it!""
}
