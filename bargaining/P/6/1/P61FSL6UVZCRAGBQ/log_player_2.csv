Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll make a proposal that takes this into account. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 40,
""alice_gain"": 60}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll evaluate the offer. Since the money is worth less than in the first round, I'll try to get a better deal. However, Alice's offer is still quite close to the initial 70/30 split. I'll accept this offer.
