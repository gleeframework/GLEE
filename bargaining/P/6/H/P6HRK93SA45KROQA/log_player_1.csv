"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, but I'll give you a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $6,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $5,700. Bob's $4,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $3,200.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not quite ready to accept a 50/50 split, and I think I can do better than $5,000. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my $5,700 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $5,415. I'll take that into account when making my next offer.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob, but I'm still holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's see if we can find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $5,415 is now worth 86.74% of its original value, which is $4,672.70. Bob's $4,500 is now worth 52% of its original value, which is $2,340.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this offer is reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it. $5,200 is a decent amount, and I'm getting close to my target. I'm also considering the fact that the game is likely to continue with further rounds of inflation, and it's better to settle now rather than risking a worse deal in the future."
