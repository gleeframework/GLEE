**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly for both of us. She seems to believe I'll cave under the pressure of inflation.  I need to hold firm and show her I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer deal."

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm holding firm on getting the bigger share. The message is direct, emphasizing the time pressure and the diminishing returns.  Hopefully, this will push Alice to accept before we both lose out."
