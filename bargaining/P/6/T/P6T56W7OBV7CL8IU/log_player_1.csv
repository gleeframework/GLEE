Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even this time.  I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not sure how the inflation will play out, so we should aim for something closer to a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
