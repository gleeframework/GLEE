"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm taking the lion's share. Accept and we're done. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
It's a bit early to accept a deal where I only get 10% of the money. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm offering you a good share, and we can end this quickly.  What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share. Accept this, or we'll keep going until the money's worth nothing! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is significantly better than the previous round's.  It's also worth noting that if I keep rejecting, the money will become increasingly worthless due to inflation, particularly for Alice. This seems like a reasonable compromise."
