"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 4000 is now worth 95% of what it would have been in the first round. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is affected by inflation in the same way, but I'll assume it is.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as I'd rather have a higher share. However, it's still a decent proposal, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse offer in the next round. I'll accept this offer.
