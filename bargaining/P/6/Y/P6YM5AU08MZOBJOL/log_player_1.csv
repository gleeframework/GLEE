I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer.  I'm taking the lion's share, but giving Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take the $1000, the fact that inflation is affecting Bob differently means I can potentially get a much better deal in the next round.  I'll see if I can negotiate something closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going for a more balanced offer this time.  I'm reducing my share to $6000,  hoping that Bob sees this as a fairer split.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement in this round."
