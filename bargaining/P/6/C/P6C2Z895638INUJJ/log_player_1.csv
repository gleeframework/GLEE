"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 7:3 ratio. This allows us both to have a substantial amount, while still providing a significant portion to you.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the initial offer was 7:3 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
