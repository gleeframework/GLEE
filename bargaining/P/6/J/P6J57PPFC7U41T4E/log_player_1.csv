Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm proposing a slightly different split: $55 for me and $45 for you.  It's still relatively even, but reflects that I'm willing to risk another round of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
