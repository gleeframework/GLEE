This is a classic negotiation scenario. I'm going to start by being very greedy, hoping Bob will accept even a tiny share.  If not, I'll adjust my offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very generous, but I'm still hopeful I can get a better deal. I'm going to reject this and see if I can negotiate a larger share for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to lower my demands slightly, but still aim for a large portion of the money. I figure Bob might be willing to compromise after his generous offer in the previous round was rejected."
