"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the total, which is $200,000, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $800,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to adjust my expectations. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, considering the inflation.

I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
