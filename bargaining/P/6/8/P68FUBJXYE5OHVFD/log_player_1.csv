"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept Bob's offer. However, it's still a decent split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced values. Here it is:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800}

This is a slightly more even split, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
