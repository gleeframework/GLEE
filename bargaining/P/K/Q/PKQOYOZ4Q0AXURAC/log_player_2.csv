Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, time is running out. However, she's clearly feeling the pressure more with the higher inflation rate working against her.  I need to hold my ground a bit longer and hope she panics and makes a worse offer.  We're getting close to a point where she'll be desperate to salvage something."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's end this now.  This is a very reasonable offer considering the time crunch.  You're losing value quickly.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm mirroring Alice's previous offer and applying a bit more pressure. I'm hoping the slight increase in my favor, combined with the rapidly diminishing returns, will push her to accept."
