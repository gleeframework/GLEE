"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio, with you receiving 400,000$. This seems fair given the decreasing value of money over time.

# Alice gain: 600000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a smaller share now to ensure a higher amount in the long run. This way, I'll have more to spend in the future when the money is worth less.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal division of the money, with both of us receiving $500,000. This ensures fairness and prevents any potential risk of future inflation affecting our shares. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
