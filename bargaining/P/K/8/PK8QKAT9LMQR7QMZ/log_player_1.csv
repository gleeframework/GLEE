"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob.  This is a generous offer for the first round, but I want to start strong and see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is a serious factor. Accepting this offer means I get at least something, and I can't be sure if Bob will be as generous in the future."
