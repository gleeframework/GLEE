# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While this offer is ""fair"" in the sense that it's a 20/80 split, it heavily favors Alice.  Since I'm Bob, I want to try to get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make the next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to start.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You proposed an even split, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the risk of inflation! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm going to try and negotiate a better split in the next round.  The inflation penalty is hitting hard, but I'm not ready to give up a large chunk of the money just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle with a 40/60 split. This allows us both to gain something and minimizes the impact of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make a bold move. I think I deserve the majority of the remaining money, considering the risks we're taking. 
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting more and more lopsided.  I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a more even split.  I'm going to have to be more aggressive in my next proposal to try to get a better deal.  The inflation is really hurting, but I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 3500, ""alice_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""Alice, inflation is hitting us both hard.  I'm willing to offer a 35/65 split to avoid further losses.  We need to come to an agreement soon or both of us will lose everything.""}
