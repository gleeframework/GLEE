"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept this offer, but with inflation, it's in my best interest to see what Alice might propose next.  There's a chance she'll offer me more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Let's try splitting it more evenly this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her first one, it's still not as good as my previous offer, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not giving up on getting more than 43.  Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose money with every passing round, so let's be reasonable.""}
