"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll need to adjust my calculation. I'll consider the offer in terms of the original value.

For me, the offer is equivalent to:
$400,000 / 0.8 = $500,000 in original value

For Bob, the offer is equivalent to:
$600,000 / 0.95 = $631,579 in original value

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll aim to take a smaller share to account for the decreased value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering to take 42% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving 58% for Bob."
