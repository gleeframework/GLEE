Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a better split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The inflation is impacting your share more and more. I think this is a reasonable adjustment. 
# Alice gain: 390000 
# Bob gain: 610000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily decreasing my share, taking advantage of the inflation factor. While the time pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean settling for significantly less than my initial target. It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses due to inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Urgency:** I need to impress upon Bob that the clock is ticking for both of us. Every round without an agreement hurts me more than him.
* **Compromise (slightly):** I'm willing to shift a little from my previous offer, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate to get this deal done. 
* **Finality:** This isn't a bluff. I need to convey that if he rejects this, I'm likely to accept a less favorable offer in the next round purely to avoid further inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting your share hard. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 370000 
# Bob gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

The situation has become critical. While Bob's offer is significantly lower than I'd hoped for at the start, rejecting it means risking an even worse outcome in the next round due to inflation. 

Here's why accepting is the least bad option now:

* **Severe Inflation Impact:** My share has eroded considerably. Waiting any longer will likely result in an even smaller portion.
* **Bob's Unlikely to Budge:** He's consistently moved in his favor each round, leveraging the inflation against me. It's doubtful he'll offer anything remotely close to my earlier proposals now.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Accepting, while far from ideal, still secures a significant sum. Rejecting this offer puts me at risk of getting even less, potentially to the point where it's barely worth the initial effort."
