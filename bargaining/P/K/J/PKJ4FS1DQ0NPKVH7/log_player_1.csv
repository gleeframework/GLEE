{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's split it 60-40!""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 55-45 is a fair split, considering I was initially offered 60% and now I'm being offered 45%. I'd like to propose a new offer."
