"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose to take 9000$, and let Bob take 1000$. I figure I have a lot more to lose with inflation, so it's best to maximize my share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to accept Bob's offer now. While I'd prefer more, waiting could lead to Bob getting a larger share due to inflation and a less favorable offer in later rounds."
