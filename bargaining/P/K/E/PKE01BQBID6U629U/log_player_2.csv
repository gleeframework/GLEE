Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me harder, I need a bit more to make up for it 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily decreasing her demand, but it's still advantageous for us to hold out a little longer. The inflation is hitting her much harder, and she'll become more willing to accept a less favorable deal as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point, considering the time constraint and the shrinking pot.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

- **Time pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting.  
- **Diminishing returns:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively for a slightly larger share will yield increasingly smaller gains due to the inflation. 
- **Fairness Appeal:**  A 50/50 split is easy to understand and presents a strong case for being fair, especially since Alice is experiencing a much higher inflation rate.  This could make it more likely for her to accept."
