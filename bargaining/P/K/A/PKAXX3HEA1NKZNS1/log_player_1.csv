"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to keep you in the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000, which is a 60-40 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game started!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting Bob's gain, I'll need to consider the value of the money he's offering.

Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the effective value of his offer is:

$8,000 * 0.8 = $6,400

Considering the value of the money, I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer as I was about my initial one. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

$9,000 * 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = $4,644

I'm not thrilled about this offer, especially since my gain is worth the same as in the first round. I'm starting to feel like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.
