"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty unfair offer. I'll take $99 and leave Bob with just $1.  It's a long game, and I want to see if he's willing to play along or if he'll take the small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
This is a much fairer offer than the last one.  It's a classic 50/50 split, and I'm happy to take it.  There's no point in risking getting nothing at all."
