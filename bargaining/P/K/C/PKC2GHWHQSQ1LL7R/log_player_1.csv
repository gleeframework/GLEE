"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 400,000$ and hope it's enough to make it worth my while!"
