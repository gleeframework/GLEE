"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not being too generous yet.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's the most equitable way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4,750.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 20% less, but I'll assume it's equivalent to $4,000.

Considering the offer, I think a 50/50 split is a fair deal, and I'm willing to accept it.
