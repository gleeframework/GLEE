Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

This is a classic example of the Ultimatum Game with the added element of inflation.  

While I was hoping to secure a slightly larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Pie:** The value of the $100 is rapidly decreasing. Delaying further significantly impacts both of our potential gains. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in a later round is risky. Bob might propose an even less favorable split, and the overall value will continue to diminish.

A 50/50 split, while not ideal, ensures I receive a reasonable portion of the money before its value erodes further."
