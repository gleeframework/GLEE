"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want an even split, but time is money!  I'll come down a little, let's settle this.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need to get at least 5500 to make it worth my while with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate due to inflation and is now offering more than half. While it's tempting,  I need to hold out for a better deal as the inflation only hurts him, not me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""I'm taking a risk here, Bob.  This is a generous offer considering the inflation working against you.  Let's close this deal now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is feeling the pressure:** Inflation is significantly impacting his potential gains, making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal. 
* **Appear to compromise:** Offering a slight increase for myself (from $6000 to $6500) might make Bob feel like he's getting a concession, even though the offer is still heavily in my favor. 
* **Urgency:** Emphasizing the time constraint and the negative impact of inflation on Bob's share might push him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm willing to take a loss to avoid getting nothing at all. Let's go back to your initial offer, but I'll take 4000 instead. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has finally caved to the pressure of inflation. This is the exact offer I made in Round 1, and it's still a great deal for me. There's no guarantee I can get more out of him in the remaining rounds, and risking it all for a slightly larger gain isn't worth it. It's time to secure the win."
