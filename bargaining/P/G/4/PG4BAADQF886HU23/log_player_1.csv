"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start.  Let's be reasonable and avoid any unnecessary rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not ready to give in yet!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous for me, considering I'm the one who's losing value due to inflation. I'd like to propose a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of my money.

Let's try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, taking into account the decreasing value of my money. I'm still willing to compromise, but I think 55% is a fairer share for me."
