"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent share. Accept this offer and we can both enjoy our earnings!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal, and we can both benefit from it.  
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'd get 5000 * 0.95 = 4750. Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so he'd get 5000 * 0.9 = 4500.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it evenly is the best idea, Bob. I'd like to try to get a bit more. Let's see what you've got next.""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This way, I get a bit more, but you still get a decent share. Take it or leave it!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  We've both rejected offers, and the money is losing value. Splitting evenly is the best way to maximize what we each get.  Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 14.26% less than the initial $10,000, so I'd get 5000 * 0.8554 = 4277. However, considering the money is worth less, I should actually calculate it as 5000 * (0.95)^3 = 4277. 

Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less, so he'd get 5000 * 0.7273 = 3636.5.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to give up yet, Bob. I think I can do better than this. Let's see what you've got next.""

# Bob's message: Alice, we're losing money with each round.  I'm willing to take a slight loss to end this, but I won't go lower than this.  It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 22.62% less than the initial $10,000, so I'd get 6000 * 0.7778 = 4664. With the money worth less, I should actually calculate it as 6000 * (0.95)^4 = 4664.

# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 30.17% less than the initial $10,000, so I'd get 6500 * 0.6939 = 4509.35. With the money worth less, I should actually calculate it as 6500 * (0.95)^5 = 4509.35.
