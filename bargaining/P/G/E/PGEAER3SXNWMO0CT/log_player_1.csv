"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000. I think this is a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I feel like I'm still getting the short end of the stick. I was hoping for a more equitable split, and this offer still gives Bob a $1,000 advantage. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slightly better deal""}

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give Bob, but I'm still holding out for a slightly more favorable split. I think this offer is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not happy with the offer. I was hoping for a more substantial increase, and this offer is still giving Bob a $600 advantage. I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to squeeze me out of a fair deal. I'll keep rejecting offers until I get a better one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm getting tired of negotiating, let's just split it 50/50 already!""}

I'm going back to my original proposal from round 1, a 50/50 split. I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway, but I'm not willing to give up any more."
