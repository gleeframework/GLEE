"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think I deserve more considering the risk of inflation. This 4:1 split is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
