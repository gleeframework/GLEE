"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Your turn to be reasonable. This is a one-time offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 55-45 is my limit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Reason: Although not a great deal, it's still better to hold out and see if I can get a bit more in the next round.  Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, so there's a chance for a slightly better outcome.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A fair 50/50 split is the most logical solution.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to give you one more chance. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Reason: This is a tough decision, but the value of my potential gains is decreasing significantly with each round. While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, accepting this offer is better than risking getting even less in future rounds, or even walking away with nothing if we don't reach an agreement.
