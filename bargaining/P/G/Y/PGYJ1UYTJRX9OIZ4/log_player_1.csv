"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, but I'm not going to let you have it all this time! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is $9,000 (10,000 - 10% inflation).

For me, the effective gain would be 2,500 / 0.9 = 2,778.57 (since my gain is worth 10% less due to inflation).

For Bob, the effective gain would be 7,500 / 0.95 = 7,894.47 (since his gain is worth 5% less due to inflation).

Considering the new numbers, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I'm getting a fair deal, and I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, the total amount is still $9,000 (10,000 - 10% inflation).

I'll aim for a more balanced split this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, Bob! 45-55 split, fair and square!""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about finding a middle ground, Alice... 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, it seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me again!

Let's calculate the effective gains considering the new inflation rates:

The total amount is now $7,000 (10,000 - 30% inflation).

For me, the effective gain would be 4,000 / 0.727 (27.1% less due to inflation) = 5,500.55.

For Bob, the effective gain would be 6,000 / 0.859 (14.26% less due to inflation) = 6,977.51.

Considering the new numbers, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with the terms, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another offer!

Considering the inflation, the total amount is still $7,000 (10,000 - 30% inflation).

I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split this time, considering the reduced value of the money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Time to get serious, Bob! I'm willing to take a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
