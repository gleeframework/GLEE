"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI offered Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount, while I'll take $600,000, which is 60% of the total amount. I believe this is a reasonable offer considering the inflation rates that affect us both but impact me more significantly. I attached a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to convey that my offer is a compromise, aiming for a mutually acceptable division that acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us.\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I'm sure we can find a better split 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, accepting $400,000 in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a similar amount in the first round. Given that the money is worth 20% less to me with each passing round, I'm motivated to try and secure a better deal in the next round, despite the risk of further devaluation. Bob's message suggests he believes there's room for a better split, but his offer doesn't reflect a compromise that benefits me, especially under the pressure of higher inflation affecting my gains.\n\nYour turn! Please proceed with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob $450,000 while I take $550,000. Given the impact of inflation, my aim is to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, considering his previous offer and message. My message, ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle,"" aims to convey that I'm taking into account the devaluation of the money for both of us and am willing to compromise. Since the money is worth less with each round, especially for me, finding a mutually agreeable solution quickly is in both our interests.\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to go a little lower, but I think this split is reasonable considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer in this round. Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains—being worth 48.8% less than in the first round—I believe accepting $450,000 now is more advantageous than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Bob's offer and message indicate a willingness to compromise, and given the circumstances, this split seems reasonable. Continuing to reject offers in hopes of a better deal in later rounds poses a substantial risk of ending up with significantly less value due to inflation. Thus, securing this amount now is the most prudent decision under the current conditions.\n\nYour turn! Please conclude the game."
