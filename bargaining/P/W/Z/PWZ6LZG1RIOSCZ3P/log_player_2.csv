Alice's offer is getting worse and worse. I'm holding out for a better deal, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm still aiming for a good deal, but I'm starting to lower my expectations a bit. Hopefully, Alice will see that this is a fair offer."

Round 5

Alice's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, and I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out. Plus, the inflation is really starting to hurt. I'll take the 5000 and be done with it."
