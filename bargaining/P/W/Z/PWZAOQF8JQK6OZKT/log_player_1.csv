"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This is my first offer. I'm taking a large portion, but I'm also giving Bob a chance to start with some money.  Let's see how he responds!"

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm lowering my share again. This is a significant amount of money for both of us, and it's getting more and more risky to keep rejecting offers. Hopefully, Bob realizes this and accepts."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm taking a risk here by proposing a 50/50 split.  The inflation is really starting to bite, and I need to be more aggressive. If Bob is still being stubborn, I'm prepared to see this through to the end. Let's see what he does!"
