# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Time is running out! This is almost an even split.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is on my side.  Alice is experiencing significant inflation, making each round less valuable to her. I'm willing to push my luck a bit longer to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be fair.  A 50/50 split is the most logical choice. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate as the value of her potential winnings decreases rapidly. Offering a 50/50 split now is the safest bet. It guarantees I get a fair share, and there's a high chance Alice will accept to avoid losing even more to inflation."
