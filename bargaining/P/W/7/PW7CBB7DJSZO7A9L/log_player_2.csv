"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take a larger share, but you still get something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Please let me know when it's my turn to propose a division.\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to clarify, since we're proceeding to the next round, the total value of the money decreases by 10% for me and 5% for Alice, correct? So, the new total value would be 900,000 for me and 950,000 for Alice. Is that right?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll take that into account. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm curious to see her response!"
