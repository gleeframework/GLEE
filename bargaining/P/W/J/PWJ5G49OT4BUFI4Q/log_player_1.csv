Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to start, no need to negotiate too hard""
}
```

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $10,000 is now worth $9,000.
