"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer. Since this is the first round and the money has full value, I'm aiming for almost everything.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept such a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer more, it's clear Bob isn't going to accept anything close to my original offer. Accepting this offer secures a large share of the money, and it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing in the later rounds."
