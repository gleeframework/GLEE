"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, which is a fair starting point, and leaves 10% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to give you the whole thing yet. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $190,000. Bob's gain of $800,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $640,000.

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than last time. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the remaining amount, which is a slightly better deal for me than the previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give up too much yet. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $400,000 is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, which is $342,000.
Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth 52% of what it was in the first round, which is $520,000.

I'm not convinced that this offer is a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation. I'll reject it.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split it down the middle and end this.""
}
```

This offer gives me 55% of the remaining amount, which is a more balanced split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this and we can finally divide the money."
