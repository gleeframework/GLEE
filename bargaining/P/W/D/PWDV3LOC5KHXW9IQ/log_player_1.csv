"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This way, we both get a decent share and can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, his 50/50 offer is effectively 50% of $9,500 (10,000 * 0.95) for him, and 50% of $10,000 for me.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the inflation affects your share more.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to take a slightly larger share this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, a bit more than 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts Bob is offering:

$10,000 * 0.95 (previous round) * 0.95 (previous round) = $8,522.50 (effective value for Bob's share)
$8,522.50 * 0.55 (Bob's share) = $4,669.38 (Bob's actual gain)

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, my gain of $5,200 is still $5,200.

Considering the effective values, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take this offer. It's a good compromise, and I don't want to risk going to Round 5.""
}
```"
