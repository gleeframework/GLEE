"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing it as a compromise to see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50-50 is a fairer split. Your turn to accept or reject! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the value of the money has decreased, and Bob's offer seems more attractive.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not yet willing to accept a 50-50 split, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 55-45 is a fairer split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a 55-45 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think 60-40 is a fairer split considering the inflation. Your turn to accept or reject! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation effect, the value of the money has decreased substantially, and Bob's offer seems more appealing.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% share, especially considering the significant inflation that has reduced the value of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."

```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between our previous offers, and I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor."
