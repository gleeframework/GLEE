"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to reject it for now. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, a bit more for me this time""
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly more aggressive stance this time, hoping to get a better share of the $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be careful not to get too greedy.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it this time. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.
