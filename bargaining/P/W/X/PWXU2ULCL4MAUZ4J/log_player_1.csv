"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

This is my opening offer, where I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly, considering the decreasing value of money in each round. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the decreasing value of money, I'd like to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a slightly better deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, and I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want the majority.""
}
```

I'm increasing the amount I'm willing to give to Bob, but I'm still proposing that I get the majority of the $100."
