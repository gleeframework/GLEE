"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000 and give Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
