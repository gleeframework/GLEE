"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that encourages Bob to be reasonable and accept the offer. Since it's the first round, I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and setting a good starting point for negotiations. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bigger cut to make it worthwhile. This offer is fair. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. While he's trying to appear fair, a 55-45 split in his favor doesn't seem like a significant concession, especially considering the money is worth 5% less this round. I'm hoping to get a better deal or make a counteroffer that will put more pressure on Bob. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a 57-43 split in my favor, with a message suggesting that we meet in the middle. Considering the previous offers, this seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see it that way too. Since the money is worth even less this round, there's pressure on both of us to come to an agreement. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially with inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on our potential gains, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable option at this point. With the money worth 14.26% less than in the first round, it's clear that prolonging the negotiations further will only result in both of us losing more value. Bob's message also implies that this is his final offer, so I'm not optimistic about getting a better deal in the next round. I'll accept the 50/50 split to secure my share of the remaining value."
