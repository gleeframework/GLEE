"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 20/80, I'll try to counter with a 60/40 split, which is a more favorable ratio for me. However, I'll take into account the inflation, so I'll offer a slightly smaller amount to Bob.
