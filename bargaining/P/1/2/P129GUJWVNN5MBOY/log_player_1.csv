Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}

# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a decent share too 
# Alice gain: 4000

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of its original value.
