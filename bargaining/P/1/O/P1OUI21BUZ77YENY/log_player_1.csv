  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit better than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. Your turn to decide.""

# Alice gain: 55
