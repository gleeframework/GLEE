Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I still need a significant amount to make this worth my time.  Think about it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. While she loses value due to inflation, waiting her out indefinitely isn't the best strategy. I need to incentivize her to make a deal while also aiming for a more equitable split."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. It's the best solution for both of us at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally proposing a fair and equal split. While I could try to push for a slightly larger share in subsequent rounds, the risk is too high now. The longer we wait, the less her share is worth to her, increasing the chance she'll propose a worse deal. Accepting a 50/50 split at this stage guarantees a substantial sum and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
