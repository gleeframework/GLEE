 I'll start with a generous offer, giving Bob a small share. Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'll reject this offer. While it's a lot of money, inflation is reducing the value of my share, and I can potentially get more by making my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer a more balanced split, considering the inflation. This should be more appealing to Bob than the previous round's offer."
