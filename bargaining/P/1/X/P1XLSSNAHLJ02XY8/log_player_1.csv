"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not thrilled about taking only 30% of the total, so I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offer, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think 55% is a fair share 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting closer, but I still want a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 45% and I'll try to negotiate for an even higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to squeeze out a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway on the split, but I think I deserve a slight edge""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a slight improvement from Bob's previous offer, and I'm hoping he'll accept this time."
