  ""bob_gain"": 3750,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to give you more in future rounds if you accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
