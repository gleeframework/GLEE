I'm taking a risk by offering Bob a very small share, hoping he'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in future rounds due to inflation.  Let's see if he takes the bait!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

It's better to take the 500,000 now, even with the 5% inflation, than risk getting nothing if Bob keeps rejecting offers and the money keeps depreciating for me."
