"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20-80 split, even with the reduced value of the money. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 42-58 split""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the original 50-50 split, but still takes into account the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more after rejecting your previous offers. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money continues to decrease due to inflation, and Bob's offer is even more skewed towards his favor. I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and I need to make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I need to take care of myself too""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's reasonable given the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
