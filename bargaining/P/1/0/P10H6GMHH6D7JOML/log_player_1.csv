"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, as Alice. I'm taking advantage of the inflation factor, knowing that Bob will get the full value of his share in each round while mine decreases. This maximizes my potential gain in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** My gains are worth 20% less than in the first round.  Accepting this offer guarantees me $60, which is worth more than what I'd get if I rejected and had to make a counter-offer in the next round. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject, there's a risk that Bob will propose a 50/50 split in the next round, which would result in a much smaller gain for me. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent share, even if it's not ideal."
