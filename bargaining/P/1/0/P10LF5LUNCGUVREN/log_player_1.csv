"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This is a relatively fair split, considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, the money is worth less now.

I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a slightly smaller share, but I'm not sure if this is the best I can get. Let's see what happens in the next round.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for the risk of waiting. Accept this and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, taking 55% of the remaining $10,000, and leaving 45% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation rates, the money is worth even less now.

I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair compromise. I'll accept your offer and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation rates, this seems like a fair compromise. I'll take 45% of the remaining $10,000, which is $4,500, and Bob will take the rest, $5,500."
