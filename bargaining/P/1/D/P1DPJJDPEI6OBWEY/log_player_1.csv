{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see if you'll follow 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer for now. I'll try to do better in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more and more one-sided! I'm not thrilled about the idea of giving up so much more money, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation.

However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll try to make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to Bob.

I'm proposing a 25/75 split, giving Bob a significant majority of the remaining money. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob and that we can finally reach an agreement."
