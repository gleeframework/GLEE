7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think 70/30 is a fairer split considering the inflation.  Let's get this done.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"This is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Agree now, and we both benefit from the diminishing returns.",Bob,4,
