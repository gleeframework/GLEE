Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly Alice, no need to drag this out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, I stand to gain more by waiting.  With each round, the relative value of Bob's share decreases due to the 5% inflation.  I'm willing to gamble that he'll offer a better deal in later rounds to avoid getting stuck with an even worse deal for himself."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, how about a slightly better split for me this time? It accounts for the inflation working against you.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair offer considering the time pressure, Alice. Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is finally starting to feel the heat of the inflation working against him. This offer is better than my previous offer, and while I might be able to squeeze out a little more in further rounds, the risk of Bob offering even less in the future (as his position weakens) isn't worth it. It's time to take the win."
