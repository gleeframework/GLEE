Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10.  I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives me a large share but still gives Bob something.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing in the next round."
