5000.0,5000.0,I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  Let's be reasonable and end this game right now.,Bob,2,

6000.0,4000.0,"I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than 20%.  Let's meet in the middle and split the money 60/40 in my favor. This is a fair offer considering the inflation and the fact that we're already at round 4.",Bob,4,
