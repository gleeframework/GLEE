6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair considering the inflation working against you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I understand the inflation is a factor, but that offer was too much in your favor. Let's meet somewhere in the middle.",Bob,2,
,,"This is still heavily skewed in your favor, especially considering the inflation. I'm willing to negotiate, but this isn't it.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"The inflation is working heavily against you, Bob. This offer is more realistic considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. I'm taking a slight hit on this offer considering the inflation, but it's a fair deal.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, you're not taking a 'slight hit'. You're getting over half the money while it's depreciating at a much faster rate for you! I'm offering a realistic deal considering the circumstances. Let's be reasonable here.",Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, this is a compromise. I'm lowering my initial ask, but I need you to meet me halfway. This is a fair deal considering the time constraint and the rapid devaluation of your share.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose if this goes on. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point.",Bob,6,
,,"Okay, Bob. A 50/50 split it is. Let's not drag this out any longer and lose even more.",Alice,6,accept
