"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'd rather have a higher share to compensate for the loss in value. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk waiting for a potentially worse offer in the next round.
