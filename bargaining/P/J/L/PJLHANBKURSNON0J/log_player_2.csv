**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice is offering slightly more, the inflation is eating significantly into Bob's potential gains.  It's worth holding out for a better deal a little longer."

Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is mounting as we approach the halfway point, but accepting Alice's offer would mean settling for less than half the original value due to inflation. It's still worth holding out for a better deal, even if it means taking a risk."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting critical! We need to settle this now. My offer is more than fair considering the time pressure.""}

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll give in a tiny bit more, but I think I've compromised enough 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While not ideal, Alice's offer of $45 is the best Bob is likely to get at this stage. The inflation rate means every round significantly decreases the value of his potential winnings. Accepting now cuts losses and ensures Bob gets something."
