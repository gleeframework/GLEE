"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob. No need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take a larger share. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less in round 2, and another 10% less in round 3).

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not convinced you're being generous enough, Alice. I'll take a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is not budging. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's not my ideal share, but it's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds."
