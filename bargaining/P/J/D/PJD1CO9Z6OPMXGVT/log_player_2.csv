Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a reasonable share.  Let's split it 57/43 in my favor, with me getting slightly more to account for the inflation.  This seems like a fair middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57
