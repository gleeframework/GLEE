"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives you a good share and avoids us risking our money on inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, I understand the inflation hits you harder. Let's meet in the middle. This offer recognizes your risk but still provides a good return for me. 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, but it's still heavily in her favor.  Given the faster rate of inflation for me, holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds is the better strategy."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is pointless. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a good amount before inflation eats away at it further.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, but the inflation hurts you more than me. I'm willing to adjust my previous offer to meet you closer, but I need you to acknowledge the reality of our situation. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the inflation argument to her advantage, but her offer is still significantly skewed in her favor. While a 50/50 split is off the table, accepting anything less than 470,000 for myself at this stage would be a bad deal considering the rapidly devaluing money. The next few rounds are crucial, and I need to signal that I'm willing to risk it all for a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. I understand your position, but I can't accept anything less than this. We're running out of time, and this is a fair compromise considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer represents a calculated risk. It sends a strong signal to Alice that I'm serious about getting a fair deal and willing to walk away if necessary.  It's a slight concession from the 50/50 split but still secures me a significantly better outcome than her last offer.  The rapidly approaching deadline and increasing inflation put pressure on both of us to reach an agreement. This offer gives Alice a chance to secure a reasonable sum while avoiding the risk of ending up with nothing."
