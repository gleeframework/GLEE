"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take a bit more since I'm taking the risk of proposing first. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a better offer. The current proposal is too skewed in Alice's favor. Let's see if I can get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's aim for a more balanced split, taking inflation into account.""}\n\n###\nI've considered the impact of inflation on my share and have proposed a division that reflects a more equitable split, while also accounting for the devaluation of money over rounds. This offer should be more reasonable for both parties."
