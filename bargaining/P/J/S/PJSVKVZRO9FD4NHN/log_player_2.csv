# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm lowering my share again, but this is the last time. We both lose if we don't agree now! 
# Bob gain: 4850 
# Alice gain: 5150 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll take a risk and try to get a better deal, despite the increasing inflation. Maybe Alice is bluffing and will give in to a more favorable offer. The loss in value is significant, but I think I can still get a better split. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'd like to propose the following division:
{""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  We are running out of time and I'd rather get something than nothing! 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant loss in value due to inflation and Alice's final offer, I believe it's better to accept this deal rather than risking further devaluation or ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. This seems to be the most reasonable choice at this point."
