"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in an 80-20 ratio, with you receiving $2000. I believe this is fair given the decreasing value of money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a higher share, but I'm not going to give you all the money. I propose a 60-40 split. This way, we both get a decent amount and I still get to keep some for myself. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
