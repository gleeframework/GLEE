Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's fair!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
