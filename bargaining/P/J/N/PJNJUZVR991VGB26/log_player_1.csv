"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going for a greedy approach in the first round. I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%.  Let's see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting a bit less than I wanted, I'm getting a significant amount and it's better than risking getting nothing.  I'll use this time to figure out how inflation is affecting Bob and adjust my strategy for future rounds."
