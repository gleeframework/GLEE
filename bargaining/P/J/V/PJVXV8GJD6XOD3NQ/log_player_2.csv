"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. It's not a fair split, and I'm not sure how inflation is going to affect things. I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's try an even split, Alice. I think it's the fairest way to go.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, Bob. How about a 55-45 split? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer an even split, inflation is quickly diminishing the value of the money.  A 55-45 split is better than getting nothing at all."
