"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself, 55 dollars, and 45 dollars to Bob, with a message ""Let's be fair!"" to start the negotiations. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fair is fair. Now it's my turn to propose. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer of 45 dollars for me and 55 dollars for him. The offer seems similar to mine, but with the roles reversed. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make a new proposal. The inflation might make the money worth less, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer 52 dollars for myself and 48 dollars for Bob. Given the inflation, the actual value is slightly less, but I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept. My message ""Meet me in the middle?"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and compromise. Let's see how Bob responds!"
