Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle this time.  50 for you, 50 for me.  It's the fairest way to go. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll take the 50/50 split. It's a fair deal, and the inflation is starting to bite."
