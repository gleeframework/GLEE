Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a better deal, the inflation is hurting my potential gains.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something."
