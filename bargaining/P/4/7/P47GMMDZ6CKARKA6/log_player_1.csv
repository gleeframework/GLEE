"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to keep 60 dollars for myself and give 40 dollars to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering we both lose money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, I have to consider the inflation.  My share is worth 10% less, and Bob's share is worth 20% less, so it's in my best interest to accept this offer before the value of the money decreases further."
