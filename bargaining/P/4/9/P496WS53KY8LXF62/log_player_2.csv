"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is the best I can offer 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players. Waiting any longer will result in a smaller reward for Bob, even if he manages to secure a slightly better split in a future round.
* **Alice's Offer:** While Alice is still getting a slightly better deal, the difference is no longer as significant considering the inflation. Accepting the 42 ensures Bob at least gets something reasonable.

Waiting any longer is a gamble that might not pay off. Bob would be risking getting an even smaller share in the next round."
