"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should switch roles for a fair turn. You proposed a split, now it's my turn. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see what Bob is trying to do!

I'll reject this offer. I'm not comfortable with a 60-40 split, especially since I think I can negotiate a better deal. Plus, I'm not sure if Bob's inflation effect is the same as mine, so I don't want to give up too much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make a new offer!

Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about a 55-45 split?""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still being reasonable. Your turn, Bob!"
