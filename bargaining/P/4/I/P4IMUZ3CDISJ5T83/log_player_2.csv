"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous today.  One dollar for you, Bob, seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
One dollar is not a fair share, let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. A 90/10 split is fair considering we both have equal power in this game. Accept this and we both get a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, how about we split it 90/10?  I'm willing to compromise, but let's be realistic, I'm the one making the offers now. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, I'd rather have 100,000 than nothing.  Let's end this before we both lose out."
