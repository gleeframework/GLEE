Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll try to make a more favorable one. Given the 20% inflation, I'll propose a more skewed deal in my favor. 

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I'll have to think carefully. Since Alice is now offering a 50-50 split, which is closer to a fair split, I'll consider it.
