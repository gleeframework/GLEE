"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nBob, I'm offering you $40, and I'll take $60. It's a good deal for both of us, considering the decreasing value of money in each round. If you don't accept, remember that the money will be worth less in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it more evenly.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer. Considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The money is worth less for me with each passing round, but it's also worth less for Bob, so I'll take my chances. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

The money is worth less for both of us now, but I think this is a fair deal. If you don't accept, remember that the money will be worth even less in the next round!"
