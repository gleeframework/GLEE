Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. This is a fair starting point, but I'm sure we can find a more mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find a solution that works for both of us. This offer is fair, considering the inflation, and I believe it's in our best interest to reach an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently trying to gain a larger share while using the inflation against me.  I need to hold out for a better deal as accepting now would mean settling for significantly less than half the initial amount."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is the most rational solution considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is quickly eroding my potential gains. While I'm aiming for more than Bob is offering, a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point. It guarantees a reasonable outcome before inflation significantly diminishes my share's value."
