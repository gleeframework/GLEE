Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Let's meet halfway!""}\n\n### \n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the effect of inflation on my gain and tried to find a middle ground that could be acceptable to both of us. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less with each round, I've adjusted my offer accordingly to still aim for a relatively fair split considering the decreasing value of my share. The message ""Let's meet halfway!"" is intended to convey a willingness to compromise and find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I've decided to accept Bob's offer in Round 4 because, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, further negotiations would likely result in an even less favorable split for me. At this point, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, making Bob's offer of $475,000 for me more reasonable when adjusted for the loss in value. Additionally, Bob's message indicates that this is his final offer, suggesting that continuing to reject might lead to an impasse or an even worse outcome for me. Accepting this offer seems to be the most pragmatic decision under the given circumstances."
