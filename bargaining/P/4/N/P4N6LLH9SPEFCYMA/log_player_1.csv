"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the cash!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000 dollars, which is a generous share, but I'm taking the larger share of 600,000 dollars. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll give you a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not too thrilled about giving up 300,000 dollars, but I'm also not eager to go to the next round and risk losing even more value due to inflation. Let's see...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving Bob too much. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice. Time to make a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make a point about being fair!

I'll think about it... Since the money is worth less for both of us, I'll have to consider the relative values. With inflation, Bob's offer is actually a better deal for him than it was in the previous round, but it's still a relatively fair split.
