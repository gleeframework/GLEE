"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation rates. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, he should be motivated to accept this offer rather than risking a lower value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more agreeable split. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round, he will be more motivated to accept a less favorable offer as the game progresses. Additionally, accepting $40 now would mean I'm accepting a relatively low offer, considering I started with a more generous offer in the first round. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $45, which is a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer. Considering the inflation rates, Bob should be more motivated to accept this offer, as the value of the money decreases more significantly for him in each subsequent round. I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on, while still getting a relatively good deal for myself."
