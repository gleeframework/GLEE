I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I figure if Bob rejects, I can still get a good deal in the next round, as I'll get to propose.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though inflation has devalued my potential gains, Bob's offer is still pretty good.  I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round, so I'll accept."
