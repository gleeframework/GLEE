"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm hoping Bob might be willing to accept this and we can call it a day!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a more favorable offer for myself this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
