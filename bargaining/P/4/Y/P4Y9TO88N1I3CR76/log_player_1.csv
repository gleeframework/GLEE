"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the value of the offer in terms of the original amount.

If I accept this offer, I'll get 50 dollars, which is worth 50% of the original 100 dollars. However, I'm not sure what the value of Bob's gain is, since I don't know the effect of inflation on his side.

I'll decide to reject this offer, since I'm not sure if I'm getting the better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 50/50, I'll try to make a better offer for myself this time. I'll take a bit more, but not too much, considering the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the actual value of Bob's offer in terms of the original amount.

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and the first round's money was worth 100, the value of my gain in the fourth round is 100 * (1 - 0.271) = 72.9% of the original 100 dollars.

Bob's offer is 48 dollars, which is worth 48 / 0.729 = 65.9 dollars in the original amount. This is less than my original offer of 55 dollars.

Considering the inflation, I'll decide to reject this offer, since I'm not getting a better deal than my previous offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make an even better offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit more, but not too much.

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and the first round's money was worth 100, the value of my gain in the fifth round is 100 * (1 - 0.271) = 72.9% of the original 100 dollars.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44}"
