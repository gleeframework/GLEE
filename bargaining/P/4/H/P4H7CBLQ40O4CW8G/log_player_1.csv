"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer considering the inflation risk.  We both get a good share, and I'm willing to take a bit less to avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
