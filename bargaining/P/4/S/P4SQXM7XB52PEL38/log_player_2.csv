"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how Alice reacts to a counter-offer. The inflation is working in my favor more than hers."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but let's be a bit more realistic. This offer is fair considering the time pressure.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, but I think I can still get a better deal. The inflation is working in my favor, and she's feeling the pressure more with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I'll take a smaller cut, but still more than you offered 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I have to be realistic.  Alice called my bluff, and while I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
