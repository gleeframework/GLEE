"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too greedy, I'll give you a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was too greedy, huh?

Okay, let me consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd better think carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm not satisfied with the 30% share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 52% share, hoping it's more to his liking."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect too much! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation has taken a toll on the money's value, I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer. A 45% share is a bit better than my previous offer, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping it's the best I can do.
