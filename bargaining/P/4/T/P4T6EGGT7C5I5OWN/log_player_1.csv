"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, my gain of $2,000 is now worth less. I'll think carefully...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, and I'll take the remaining $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the value of the money in this round:

Alice's gain of $3,000 is worth 71.5% of the original $6,000 I offered in round 1, which is $4,290.
Bob's gain of $7,000 is worth 70% of the original $4,000 I offered in round 1, which is $2,800.

This offer is actually a good deal for me, as I'm getting more than my original offer of $4,290. I'll accept this offer.
