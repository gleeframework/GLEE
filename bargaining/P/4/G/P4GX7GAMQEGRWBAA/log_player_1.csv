"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept the offer as it is a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting the offer because, although the split is even, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, and I think I can get a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""It's getting less valuable, let's settle""}\n\nI'm offering a 58-42 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept the offer as the money is losing value due to inflation and it's better to settle now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting the offer because, considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (27.1% less than the first round), I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and further rounds would only lead to even less valuable gains."
