Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your starting point is a bit off.  Let's be more realistic. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. This reflects the fact that I'm hit harder by inflation in this scenario.  Think carefully, time is money, literally!""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle this time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to go, given our different inflation rates.  If you reject again, we're going to lose a lot of money! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
