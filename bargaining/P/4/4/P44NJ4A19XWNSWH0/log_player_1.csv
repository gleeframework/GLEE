"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now I'll take a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to give up 2/3 of the total amount, especially since my share is worth the same as in the first round. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering Bob a slightly smaller share than the original 50/50 split, but still giving him a significant portion of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking advantage of it 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting worried about the decreasing value of my share due to inflation!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept such an extreme imbalance in the split, especially since Bob's share is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll try to make a new offer that's more reasonable.

I'll think carefully before making my next move..."
