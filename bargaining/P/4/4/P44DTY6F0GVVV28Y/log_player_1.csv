"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't get the better deal, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the $100,000 I would gain is now worth $80,000. The $900,000 Bob would gain is still worth $900,000.

I don't want to take a deal that leaves me with only $80,000. I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 60% and take 40%. Better than last round, right?""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm feeling generous! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 48.8% inflation, the $1,000,000 is now worth $519,200. The $300,000 I would gain is now worth $159,936.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm getting desperate and don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
