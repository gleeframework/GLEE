"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too skewed towards you, Bob! I want a fairer split.""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! A slightly more generous offer this time.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to squeeze more out of the deal.

Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth even less, and I need to be cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there, Bob! I'm not willing to give up that much more.""
}
```

I'll try to make a new offer that's even more generous, considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money continues to erode. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway, but that's as low as I'll go.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's reasonable, considering the inflation and the reduced value of the money. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
