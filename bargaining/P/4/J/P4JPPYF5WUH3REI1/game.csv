45.0,55.0,Your offer was a bit too much in your favor.  How about a 55/45 split? The value of the deal decreases for both of us each round we wait.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's call it even. A 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable given the inflation.  We both get the same value, and we can move on.",Alice,3,
