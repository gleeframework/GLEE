Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor.  How about a 55/45 split? The value of the deal decreases for both of us each round we wait. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
