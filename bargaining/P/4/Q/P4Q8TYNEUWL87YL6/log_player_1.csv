I propose to keep 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This feels like a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering Bob 200,000 dollars and keeping 800,000 for myself. Even though I've lost 10% of the value from my previous offer, I still believe this is a good deal given the inflation. This also allows for a larger buffer for me in case Bob rejects this offer, and we continue to the next round."
