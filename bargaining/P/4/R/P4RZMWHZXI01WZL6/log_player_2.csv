Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see we're getting closer, but I still think I can get a bit more. Considering the inflation is affecting me more, I'll take 58% and you can have 42%. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor, especially considering the faster rate of inflation impacting her share.  It's worth holding out a bit longer to see if she'll offer a more balanced deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we need to compromise, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'll take 57% and you can have 43%. Inflation is hurting me more, so let's settle this soon. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging, likely hoping the faster inflation on her end will scare me into accepting. However, 43% is a significant loss, especially considering it was worth closer to 615,000 at the start.  The pressure is on, but I need to hold my ground a little longer."
