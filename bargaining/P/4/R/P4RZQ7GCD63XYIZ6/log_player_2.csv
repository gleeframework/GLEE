Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. We both know this game is getting riskier with each round. My offer is a compromise – it gives us both a decent share while avoiding the potential of getting nothing.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which is good for me. While her offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The significant inflation working against her means I have leverage to push for a much better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're nearing the halfway point, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's fair, and we both get a substantial amount. Let's end this game with a mutually beneficial outcome. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I was aiming for a larger share, Alice's offer of a 50/50 split is now acceptable. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is rapidly decreasing, especially for Alice.  Waiting any longer significantly reduces the value of the potential winnings for both of us. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal carries the increasing risk of getting nothing at all. Accepting a guaranteed $500,000 now is a safer bet than gambling on a potentially larger, but increasingly unlikely, sum later. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair, and while I had the advantage, dragging this out further could be perceived as greedy."
