**Reasoning:**

The game dynamics have shifted significantly in Alice's favor.  Here's why I'm making this decision:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of the money for me (Bob) is plummeting with each round. Accepting $430,000 now is better than risking even less in future rounds.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice knows the inflation works against me and is likely to keep pushing for a better deal for herself. She called my bluff on the ""final offer,"" showing she's willing to play hardball.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I'd prefer a larger share, the difference between accepting this offer and a potentially worse one in later rounds is no longer worth the risk given the inflation rate.

It's frustrating, but accepting this offer cuts my losses and prevents me from being stuck with a much worse deal."
