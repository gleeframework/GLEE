"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but also leaves a significant share for Bob. I hope this encourages him to accept, but I'm prepared for him to reject and make a counter offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is significantly better than what he offered in the first round, it is still much less than what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to make a counteroffer that reflects the value of the money after inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation that has occurred, but still provides a substantial amount for Bob. I believe this offer is fair considering the circumstances, and I hope he will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but it's still not enough. With inflation, the money is worth significantly less, and I'm going to push for a better deal. I'm ready to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 576000, ""bob_gain"": 424000}
```

This offer still accounts for the significant inflation that has occurred, but it's the final offer I'm willing to make. If Bob rejects it, I'm prepared to accept his offer in the next round, even though it's not ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, the value of the money has been significantly diminished by inflation. This offer is significantly better than what I'd receive if I reject and go to the next round. I'm accepting it."
