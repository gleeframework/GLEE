"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40!""}\n\n###\nI'm offering Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6000, which is 60%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer since it's a relatively fair split, and we can both walk away with a decent amount of money. Plus, with the inflation rate, it's better for both of us to settle early and avoid losing value.\n###\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share since the money loses value faster for me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money loses value faster for him, his proposed split of 60-40 in his favor is too skewed. Considering the inflation rates, I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal in the next round than accept this offer. Plus, I'm only losing 5% of the value, whereas Bob is losing 20%, so I have a bit more wiggle room to negotiate.\n###\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the larger share.""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, taking into account the fact that the money loses value faster for him. However, I still believe I should receive the larger share, so I'm proposing a 58-42 split in my favor. I hope Bob will find this offer more acceptable, considering the increasing loss of value for both of us.\n###\nYour turn!"
