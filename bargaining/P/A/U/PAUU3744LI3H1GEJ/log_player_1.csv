"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll take the smaller share this time!""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm being generous and taking the smaller part myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, how about 55 for me and 45 for you? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to give him the majority share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. Let's see if Bob will make a new offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Split it 50-50, let's be equal!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, aiming for a 50-50 split. Will Bob accept this offer?"
