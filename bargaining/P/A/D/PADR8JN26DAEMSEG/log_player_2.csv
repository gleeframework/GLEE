Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move closer to your 60/40 proposal, but 65/35 feels more fair given the inflation affecting us both. Let's try to find a compromise here. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
