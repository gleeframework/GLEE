"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
``` 

This is a fair offer, splitting the money almost evenly. It also leaves room for Bob to potentially make a counteroffer in the next round if he's feeling greedy, without risking losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me, and while it's true that the value of his money is decreasing more slowly, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm rejecting this offer and hoping to get a better deal in the next round when I can propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise given the current inflation rates and the fact that he rejected my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and even though my money is depreciating faster, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm rejecting his offer and hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round when I can propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my share again. While inflation is hitting me harder, Bob's offer is getting worse, and I believe he's starting to feel the pressure.  I'm hoping this offer will be enough to incentivize him to accept before we lose too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and while my money is depreciating faster, I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. I'm holding out for a better offer in the next round when I can propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm pushing the limits now, but with inflation increasing, I need to secure a better share. Bob's offers are becoming unreasonable, and I believe he's starting to feel the pressure as well.  I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince him to accept before we both lose too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting even worse, and while my money is depreciating rapidly, I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'm still hoping to negotiate a better split in the next round when I can propose."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

Time is running out, and I'm taking a bigger risk. This offer is extremely generous to me, but I believe it's the best way to convince Bob to accept before we both lose even more money. It's a gamble, but I'm willing to take it."
