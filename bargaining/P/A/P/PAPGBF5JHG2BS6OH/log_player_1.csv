"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm starting with a very simple strategy: I'll offer Bob a tiny amount, hoping he'll accept it just to get something. Since the money is worth less to him in each round, I expect him to accept even a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's much better than my previous offer, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. Bob's offer is still very generous, but I want to see if I can push for even more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm increasing my offer significantly, but I'm still aiming for a good portion of the money. Since Bob is losing value on his share, I'm hoping he'll be willing to settle for a less lopsided deal."
