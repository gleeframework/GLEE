"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6000, you get $4000.  It's in our best interest to settle quickly.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's still not equitable considering the inflation rate. I'm proposing $5800 for me and $4200 for you. Let's settle this before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split considering the inflation, she's still benefiting significantly more from a quick resolution. It's in my best interest to push for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a few more rounds."

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm accepting a lower amount due to the inflation, but I need you to meet me halfway. $5500 for me, $4500 for you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept. While not ideal, this offer is closer to the split I proposed.  Further delay significantly hurts both of us, and there's no guarantee Alice will budge further. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even with the inflation considered."
