Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. Waiting any longer means a smaller overall pot for both of us.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been getting progressively ""better"" from my perspective. There's no guarantee his next offer will be as good.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in Round 5 carries a significant risk. If I reject this offer and Bob becomes more aggressive, I could end up with even less than $45.

It's a tough call, but accepting a less-than-ideal offer now is preferable to potentially getting a much worse deal later due to inflation."
