"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. What do you say?""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more for being the one who makes the next offer. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain and Bob would gain are:

My gain: 2000 * 0.9 = 1800
Bob's gain: 8000 * 0.8 = 6400

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not go to the next round if I can get a better deal now.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2400,
  ""bob_gain"": 7600,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, Bob. I'll take $2,400 and you can have $7,600. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation.""

Your turn, Bob!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small consolation prize, but I'm taking the majority of the money this time. You're getting a raw deal, but I'm feeling generous. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain and Bob would gain are:

My gain: 1000 * 0.727 = 727
Bob's gain: 9000 * 0.516 = 4638

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm getting desperate. I'd rather get something than nothing, and at least this way I can stop the game from going on further.
