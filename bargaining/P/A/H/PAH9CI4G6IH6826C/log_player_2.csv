"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid inflation eating up our potential gains. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the inflation rates. Let's agree to this and avoid further losses."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm feeling the inflation pinch more than you.  I'm willing to compromise slightly from my initial offer, but 55/45 is my bottom line to get this done now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the 4500 now before the inflation eats up any more of my potential gains."
