Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise! I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I think 5750/4250 is a more balanced split. This way, we both get a good amount and can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4250 
# Alice gain: 5750
