Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round.  Since the inflation rate is unknown to me, I'm going to assume it's significant and that Bob is likely to want to accept something rather than risk getting nothing.  I'll be willing to give up a little more in later rounds if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a big step down from my initial proposal, I'm going to accept.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The 5% inflation hit me hard, but I'm only losing $50,000 of potential earnings.  That's a lot, but it's not worth risking losing everything in the next round.
* **Bob's Position:**  His proposal shows he's aware of the inflation and is taking a significant hit to his own earnings.  He's clearly willing to negotiate. 
* **Future Rounds:**  I'm likely to be hit by further inflation. If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future.

This offer is still more than I would have gotten in the first round if I'd offered a more even split.  It's a risky move, but I'm playing it safe to secure at least something."
