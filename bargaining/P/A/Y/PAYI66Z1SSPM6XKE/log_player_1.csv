"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives me a slight advantage to make up for the uncertainty of the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. A 50/50 split would mean I'd get $5,000, which is a decent amount considering the reduced value of money.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
