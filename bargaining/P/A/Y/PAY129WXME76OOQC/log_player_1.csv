Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a pretty aggressive first offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept something that gives him very little. I'm banking on the fact that he might not be aware of the inflation factor yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'm only getting $1000, it's better than nothing, and due to the inflation, if I reject and propose my own offer, I risk getting nothing at all."
