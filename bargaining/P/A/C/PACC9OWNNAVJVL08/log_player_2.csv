Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, it's equivalent to $900,000. I'll make a proposal.

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, and the first round's $500,000 is worth $810,000 now, I'll calculate my gain in the current round as 450,000 / 0.81 = 555,555.56. However, this is still less than what I could have gotten in the first round. I'll accept this offer.
