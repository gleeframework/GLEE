"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values. Bob is offering me $400,000, which is less than my initial proposal of $500,000. However, he's offering himself $600,000, which is more than his share in the initial proposal.

I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to adjust my proposal to make it more favorable to myself. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm proposing a 55.5/44.5 split, which is slightly more in my favor than the initial 50/50 split."
