Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll make a counteroffer that takes this into account.

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."

Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

This offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'm trying to get a better share before the money becomes even less valuable."
