# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a little more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While her offer has increased slightly, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to hold strong and hope she becomes more reasonable as the rounds progress."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the deal is getting worse with each round. This is my final offer for a reasonable split.""}"

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but her ""generosity"" is laughable.  She's barely budged while my potential gains continue to shrink. I need to show I'm serious about getting a better deal, even if it means risking a worse outcome."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance, I'm not budging 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking, and Alice seems determined not to move from this split. Taking inflation into account, waiting any longer means risking a significantly smaller gain. Accepting now ensures I at least walk away with something."
