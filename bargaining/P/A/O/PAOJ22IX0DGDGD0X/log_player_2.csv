"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous in this first round, but remember, the money is worth less with each passing round.  Let's reach a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a good opportunity to test Alice's ""generosity"" and potentially get a better deal later. Rejecting the first offer shows Bob is willing to play the long game and isn't afraid of the potential for the money to lose value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a fairer split.  We both need to be careful about the decreasing value of the money - let's find a solution that works for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  I'm taking the inflation into account, and this offer is fair given the decreasing value of the money.  Let's settle this before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is now offering a significantly higher proportion of the money to Bob compared to her initial offer.  Given the decreasing value of the money, and that there are many more rounds to go, accepting this offer is the best strategic move.  Bob should focus on securing a decent chunk of the money now, rather than risking further rounds and potentially losing more value."
