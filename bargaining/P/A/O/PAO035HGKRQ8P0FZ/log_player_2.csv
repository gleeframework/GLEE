"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal aims to provide a balance between our shares while accounting for potential inflation in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I want to see if I can get a better deal.  There are many rounds left and inflation might affect Alice more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I believe this division is fairer, as we are both taking a risk with the potential for inflation. I'm willing to split the difference from your offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal division of the funds, aiming for fairness and to avoid any potential risk of inflation impacting one party more than the other. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer my previous offer, Alice's offer is now fair given the inflation affecting her gains. Accepting avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
