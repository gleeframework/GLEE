Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a better deal for you than the last one I offered.

# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, the pot is only getting smaller for me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said the pot is getting smaller for you, so you should be more willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the game has become quite risky for Bob. Let's analyze why accepting is the best option now:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less Bob's potential share is worth due to the 10% inflation per round.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice has consistently rejected offers where she receives less than $5,700. It's unlikely she'll suddenly change her strategy.
* **Slightly Better Offer:** While not ideal, Alice's offer of $4,300 is slightly better than the previous round. Waiting further risks her offering even less. 

**While getting $4,300 isn't ideal, it's better than risking another round and potentially getting even less.  Bob needs to cut his losses and accept this offer.**"
