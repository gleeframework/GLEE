"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
I propose taking 900,000 and giving Bob 100,000. I think it's a fair starting point, given that the money is worth less for him with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal, and the money is worth less with each passing round. I need a much higher offer to accept this. I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob.  This is still a generous split considering the inflation, and I hope it's more appealing to Bob than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Even though his gains are decreasing significantly with inflation, mine are as well. I need to see a more balanced proposal. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 700,000 for myself and 300,000 for Bob. We are both losing value with inflation, so it's important to reach an agreement soon. I'm hoping this offer shows good faith and encourages Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 488000 
# Bob gain: 512000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable. While his gains are significantly affected by inflation, mine are too. I need a higher share to make this worthwhile. I'll try again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

We're running out of time, and both of us are losing money with every passing round. I'm lowering my offer again to 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob.  This is a fair compromise considering the inflation, and I hope Bob will finally accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 590400 
# Bob gain: 409600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is still not ideal, the inflation is drastically reducing the value of the money. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
