 It's worth seeing what Alice will offer in the next round, even with the inflation risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While the offer is still unfavorable, the inflation means that if I reject, I risk getting even less in the next round, especially since Alice is still getting the full value of her gains. Accepting ensures I get something, even if it's not a lot."
