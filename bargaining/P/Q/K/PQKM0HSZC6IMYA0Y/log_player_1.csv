"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too risky for me. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? This still gives you a good chunk, and we can avoid the risk of further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. We both lose money if we keep rejecting offers.  A 50/50 split seems fair, considering the risk of further devaluation.""}
