"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both get $5000. It's a fair deal, and we don't need to risk losing money to inflation in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
