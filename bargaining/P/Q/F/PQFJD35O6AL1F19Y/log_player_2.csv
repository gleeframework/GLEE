"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be willing to offer me more to avoid losing value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. How about 60-40?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'll compromise a little. Let's split it 45-55.  This is my final offer.  If you reject, I'm going to be very unhappy with the next round! 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering Alice's message, it seems she's not willing to compromise further, and the next offer might be less favorable. Since I'm already getting 55, which is more than half, and the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I'll accept this offer to avoid risking a worse outcome in the next round."
