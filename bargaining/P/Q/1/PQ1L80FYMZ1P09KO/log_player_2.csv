"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle between my initial offer and your counteroffer. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
**Reasoning:** Alice is framing this as a compromise, but she's still benefiting significantly more than Bob. While the inflation is impacting her, she's still getting a much larger share. Bob should hold out for a better deal."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 500000,
