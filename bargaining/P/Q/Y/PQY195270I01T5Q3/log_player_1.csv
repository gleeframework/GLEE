"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with. A fair and simple proposal!""}

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a chance to assess the situation and see how the game unfolds."
