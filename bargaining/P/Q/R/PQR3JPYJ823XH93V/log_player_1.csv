Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but I think we can find a compromise that's fairer considering the inflation. How about a slightly more even split this time? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
