"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I get 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With inflation, the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, so I have an incentive to end the game quickly. However, accepting 10% of the original amount right away doesn't seem like the best option. Let's see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, 40% for me""}\n\n###\n\nSince Alice started with a 90% offer for herself, I'll try to meet somewhere closer to the middle but still favorable to her, considering she doesn't lose value due to inflation. This might be more appealing to her since it gives her a significant portion while showing I'm willing to negotiate."
