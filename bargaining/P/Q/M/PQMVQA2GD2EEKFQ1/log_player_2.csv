"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it 60-40. I'll get a bit more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm Bob, and I'm feeling a little greedy. 60-40 is a bit too lopsided for me. Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55-45 split is a bit more fair, considering the money is losing value with each round. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. 57-43 is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Alice's offer. 57-43 is a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more money to inflation."
