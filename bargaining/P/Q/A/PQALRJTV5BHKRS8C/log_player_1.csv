"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is my initial offer. I will take the vast majority of the money, leaving Bob with a very small amount.  I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round, as the inflation could make this offer less appealing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer offer, and the inflation doesn't really affect my gains.  I'm happy to accept."
