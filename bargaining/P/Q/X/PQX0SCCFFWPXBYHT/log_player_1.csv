I'm proposing to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. While it's tempting to accept, I still have the advantage of making the next offer.  I can improve on this deal for myself, considering the inflation impact."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and give Bob $2,000. This is a better deal for me, considering the inflation, and still leaves Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one.  While the inflation has drastically impacted my gains, I'm unlikely to get a better offer from Bob in the next round.  I'll accept and take the $2000."
