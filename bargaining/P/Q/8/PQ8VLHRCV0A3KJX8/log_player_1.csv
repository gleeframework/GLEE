Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting less than my initial offer, I'd rather secure some of the money than risk getting nothing due to further inflation."
