This is a great starting point. I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to try to get a bigger share this time. I'll offer Alice a small amount, hoping she'll accept to avoid the risk of further rounds and inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's getting risky to keep rejecting.  Alice is clearly willing to take a significant cut, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
