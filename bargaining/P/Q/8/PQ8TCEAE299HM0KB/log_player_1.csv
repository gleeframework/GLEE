"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's not as favorable to me as my original proposal, and I'm not sure if I should give up more than I initially proposed, especially considering the money is worth less with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's still not as favorable to me as my original proposal, and I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to get a better deal as the game goes on. I'll wait for a better offer."

Round 5

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'm accepting this offer because it's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk going to a lower value of money. This offer is closer to my previous proposal, and I think it's a fair compromise given the circumstances."
