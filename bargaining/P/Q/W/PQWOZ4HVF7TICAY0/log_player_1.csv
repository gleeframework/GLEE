Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 400k. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 420k, but I think I deserve more than 580k""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means I'm getting a smaller share of the total amount. Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 300k.
