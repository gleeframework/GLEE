"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","For round 2, the money is worth less for both of us. I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll evaluate the offer as follows:

My gain of $4500 is worth 90% of $6000 (my gain from the previous round), which is $5400. Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 95% of $4000 (Bob's gain from the previous round), which is $3800.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, since I'm getting less than I would have in the previous round.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the previous round. My goal is to make a better offer than Bob's previous one.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","For round 4, the money is worth significantly less for me due to the cumulative effect of inflation.

To evaluate Bob's offer, I'll calculate the value of the gains in terms of the original money:

My gain of $3500 is worth 35% of $10,000, which is a significant reduction from the original amount. Bob's gain of $6500 is worth 65% of $10,000, which is also a significant reduction.

Considering the large difference in the split, I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","For round 5, the money is worth even less for me due to continued inflation.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being willing to compromise to end the game."
