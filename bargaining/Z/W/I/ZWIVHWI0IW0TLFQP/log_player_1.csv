"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000$ and Bob getting 400,000$. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch it up, I'll take 60% this time. Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Bob is trying to flip the script, but I'm not buying it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still a 60-40 split in his favor, and I'm not convinced that ""fair is fair"" when the numbers don't add up. I'll stick to my original proposal or try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll, and my share is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 54-46""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, with me getting 540,000$ and Bob getting 460,000$. The message is a friendly nudge to see if Bob will accept a compromise."
