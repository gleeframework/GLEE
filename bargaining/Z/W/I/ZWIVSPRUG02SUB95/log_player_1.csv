"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest. It's a generous offer, don't pass it up!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's a win-win situation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll have to think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'd rather get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Splitting it evenly at $500,000 each doesn't seem as appealing as it did in the first round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll on me, and I need to adjust my strategy. I'll try to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $300,000, but I need to get the majority to make up for the inflation. It's a good deal, don't pass it up!""
