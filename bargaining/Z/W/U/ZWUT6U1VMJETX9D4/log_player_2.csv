Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you hard, but my offer is the best I can do. It's important we reach an agreement soon, as further delays hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging while I'm suffering significant losses each round.  It's time to show I'm serious about getting a larger share, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's crucial we finalize this now before inflation erodes the value even further.  This split acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While far from ideal, this is the best I'm likely to get from Alice.  Rejecting means risking even larger losses to inflation, with no guarantee of a better outcome in the remaining rounds.  Taking the $375,000 now is the safest option at this point."
