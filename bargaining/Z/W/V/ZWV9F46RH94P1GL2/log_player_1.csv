"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You get 40% and I get 60%""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $4,000 and take $6,000 for myself, which is a relatively fair split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a fair chunk too 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 70% of the remaining money, but I'm also not eager to risk going to the next round with a 5% decrease in value again.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
