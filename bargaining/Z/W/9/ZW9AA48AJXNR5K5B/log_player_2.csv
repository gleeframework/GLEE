Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a larger share than before, but we need to split this fairly for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

""alice_gain"": 475000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's find a compromise where we both get a good amount. This offer gives you a significant share, and I'm willing to take a little less. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about us both losing money due to inflation, she's not losing anything! I need to push for a better deal while it's still possible to get a reasonable amount. Accepting now would mean losing almost 20% of the potential value from round 1."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a very fair offer.  We're running out of time and this split ensures we both walk away with a respectable sum.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

It's getting late in the game and I need to make a move that has a good chance of being accepted.  This offer is still slightly in my favor, but close enough to 50/50 that Alice might be more inclined to accept it rather than risk getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're nearing the end, and the longer we wait, the more we lose. Let's compromise and split this as evenly as possible, with a slight advantage to me for taking the risk. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The clock is really ticking now, and while this isn't ideal, it's better than walking away with nothing. Alice has consistently rejected offers that give me a slight advantage, and the longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation. It's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting is the most rational choice at this point."
