"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose we split it 90/10 in my favor.  It's a good starting point and allows for some negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm willing to lower my share a bit, but still keeping the majority. This is a fairer compromise, considering the inflation impact on both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I still get a fair share. This offer accounts for the inflation and gives Bob a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough decision because the inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me. While the offer isn't ideal, accepting it ensures I at least get something, and there's no guarantee I'll get anything if we keep rejecting."
