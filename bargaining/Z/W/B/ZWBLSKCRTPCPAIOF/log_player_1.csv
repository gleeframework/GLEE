I'm proposing a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. This should be a good starting point, as it leaves a decent amount for Bob while still giving me a substantial share.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a joke! I'm not going to accept that. It's my turn to make an offer, and I'll be sure to make it more fair this time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 700,000 to 300,000 split. I'm still taking the lion's share, but I'm willing to be more generous this time. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob.  Let's see if he's feeling a bit more reasonable this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unacceptable.  It's my turn to negotiate again, and I'll be sure to make a better proposal next time.  I'm feeling confident that we can reach a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split this time.  Inflation is starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. I hope Bob is willing to be more reasonable now."
