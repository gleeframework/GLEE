"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split, giving me the majority share.  I'm confident that Bob will accept this, as it's better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair and ensures we both get something.  It's better than risking getting nothing by continuing."
