"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, let's compromise. I'm willing to take a smaller share now, but we need to get this done. Time is running out! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still skewed in her favor.  The inflation is hurting her much more than me. I need to hold out for a better deal, but I also need to be mindful that waiting too long will diminish the value of the money for both of us."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a middle ground quickly. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's a decent offer considering the time pressure and inflation working against you.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's call it even. We're both losing money with every round, so a 50/50 split seems like the best way to maximize our gains. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally feeling the pressure of the inflation. A 50/50 split is a fair deal, especially considering the diminishing returns with each passing round. It's time to secure the money while it's still worthwhile."
