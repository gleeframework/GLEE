"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than I would have gotten in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You took a big share last round, now it's my turn to take a bigger cut. Accept or lose!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting aggressive, but I'm not backing down 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. However, Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me. I'll try to squeeze out a bit more.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation, and I'm running out of time. I'll try to make a more extreme offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I need a bigger share to make up for inflation. Accept or I'll walk away!""
}
```"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but don't expect me to give in completely 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings. I'm not sure if I can afford to wait for a better offer, but meeting me halfway doesn't sound too bad. I'll accept this offer to end the game.
