"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's reverse the roles, I'll take 60% this time, but we can still negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to reverse the roles, but the offer is still not in my favor.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to Round 2.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to go higher!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal, but I'm still aiming to keep more than 50% of the remaining $10,000."
