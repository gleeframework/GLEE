"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a generous offer, considering the initial amount of $10,000. I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the initial amount, and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is 80% of the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the offer is 50/50 split, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to round 2. Considering this, my new offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but still keeping a significant portion for myself."
