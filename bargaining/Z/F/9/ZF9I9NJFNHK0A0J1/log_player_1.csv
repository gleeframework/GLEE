```
# Alice gain: 5000 (same as before)

Considering the significantly reduced value of Bob's gain, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're running out of time, and the money is losing value rapidly. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

But, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal, considering the limited time left.
