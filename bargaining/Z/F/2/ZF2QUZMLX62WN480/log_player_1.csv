"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be friends""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice is proposing to take $600,000 for herself and give $400,000 to Bob. She includes a friendly message, ""Let's be friends,"" to try to persuade Bob to accept her offer. Since this is the first round, the money has not lost any value due to inflation yet. Bob will have to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round, where he will make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice decides to reject Bob's offer of $450,000 for herself and $550,000 for Bob. Although Bob's message appeals to fairness, Alice might be considering the impact of inflation on Bob's gain and her own options for future proposals. The game will proceed to the next round, where Alice will make a new proposal. Remember, for Alice, the money maintains its value, but for Bob, the value decreases by 5% with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Alice proposes a division where she takes $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000. Her message, ""Meet me in the middle?"" suggests a compromise, possibly aiming to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the fact that they are getting closer to a middle ground. Given the inflation, Bob's gain is now worth 10% less than in the first round, which might influence his decision-making."
