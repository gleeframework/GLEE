"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation rate.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable considering the initial amount and the decreasing value of the money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the inflation rate affecting me more harshly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept this offer because I think it's still too skewed towards Bob. Although I understand his perspective on the inflation rate, I believe a more balanced split would be more fair. I'd like to make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think this split is more reasonable considering the inflation rate.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is slightly more favorable to me than the previous offer, but still takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. Although I understand Bob's perspective on the inflation rate, I think this split is still too skewed towards him. I'd like to make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5300, ""bob_gain"": 4700, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think this split is more reasonable considering the inflation rate and our previous negotiations.""}

I'm proposing a 53-47 split, which is slightly more favorable to Bob than my previous offer, but still takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think this split is still too generous for Alice, considering the rapid inflation rate is affecting me more harshly. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not satisfied with this offer. The inflation rate is indeed affecting the value of the money, but I think this split is still too skewed towards Bob. I'd like to make a new proposal in the next round."

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is slightly more favorable to Bob than my previous offer, but still takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. This is my final offer, as I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting nothing."
