"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering you $40, and I'll take $60. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping you'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my thinking for the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim for a higher share for myself to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering you $30, and I'll take $70. It's a more aggressive split, but I think it's a fair reflection of the decreasing value of the money."
