"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, which is a generous offer considering I don't know how the inflation will affect the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly, Alice.  It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the effective value of the money I gain is now 80% of the original amount.

Since the offer is to split the money evenly, I would gain 50% of the current value of the money, which is 50% of 80% of $100, or $40.

I accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
