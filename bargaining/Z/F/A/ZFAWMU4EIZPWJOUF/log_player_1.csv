"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is a friendly and cooperative approach to initiate the negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  This is a little more equitable. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer of a 45-55 split. The message ""Take it or leave it"" comes across as somewhat aggressive, and I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable outcome. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway""}\n\nI'm offering a 58-42 split, slightly adjusting my initial offer to show willingness to compromise. The message ""Meet me halfway"" encourages Bob to consider finding a middle ground, given that we've both had a chance to make an offer. Let's see how Bob responds this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is ridiculous Alice, meet me in the middle while it's still worthwhile! 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer of a 49-51 split. Although Bob suggests meeting in the middle, the offer still doesn't quite reach an equal split, considering the effects of inflation. The tone of the message seems somewhat frustrated, but I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable outcome. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Getting closer, let's settle""}\n\nI'm offering a 57-43 split, slightly adjusting my previous offer to continue showing willingness to compromise. The message ""Getting closer, let's settle"" acknowledges that we're making progress and encourages Bob to consider accepting this offer, given the increasing effects of inflation. Let's see how Bob responds this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking! This is practically an even split now. Don't be greedy. 
# Alice gain: 4950 
# Bob gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 49.5-50.5 split. Although the offer still isn't exactly an equal split, considering the effects of inflation, the difference is becoming negligible. Bob's message emphasizes the urgency of the situation, and with the money's value decreasing rapidly, I believe it's reasonable to accept this offer and finalize the division rather than risking further devaluation. Let's settle and move forward!"
