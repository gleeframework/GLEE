Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  I think that's a fair compromise, and it avoids further rounds of negotiation where we both lose value due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
