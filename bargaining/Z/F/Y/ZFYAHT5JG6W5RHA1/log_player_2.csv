I'm going to see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm taking a risk by offering a higher percentage to myself, but I believe it's a fair starting point and gives Alice a decent share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, I've been outbid twice now. Inflation is affecting my gains, and it's getting risky to keep rejecting. This offer is still a decent amount, and it's better to take it now than risk getting nothing at all."
