"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent amount. Accept this and we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

 While a decent amount, I'm not sure 100,000 is worth accepting this early in the game. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer. This way we both get a larger share and we don't have to worry about the money losing value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  This is a better split for you than before, and it ensures we both get more than if we keep going. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly better than my previous offer, and while the money is losing value, I believe this is a good deal for me. I'll take it."
