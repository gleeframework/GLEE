"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $10,000 and leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the decreasing value.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money's value decreasing by 20% for me and 10% for Bob, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a slightly higher share to make up for it.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers are getting interesting!

Considering the money's value is decreasing at an even faster rate, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth significantly less now, I'll aim to get as much as possible.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
