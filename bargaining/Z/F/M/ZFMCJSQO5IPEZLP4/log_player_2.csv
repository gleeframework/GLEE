"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'll reject this offer. While it's a reasonable starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal. I know inflation is a factor, but I also want to make sure I get a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script this time. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm open to negotiation. We both need to work together to get the most out of this deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's a fair compromise! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing with each round. It's best to secure a fair share now before the value drops even further."
