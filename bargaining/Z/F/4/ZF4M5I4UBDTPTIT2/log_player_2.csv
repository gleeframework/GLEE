# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 90% of the original amount, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, Alice's offer is actually a better deal for her than in the first round, but worse for me. However, since it's a more balanced split, I'll accept it.
