"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a split of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob. This is a fair initial offer, as it reflects the potential for inflation in the future rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal, even considering the inflation.  I'll reject this and hope to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a split of $600,000 for me and $400,000 for Bob.  This is a more balanced split than the previous round, and still takes into account the inflation factor.  I believe it's in Bob's best interest to accept, as the next round will see even further inflation."
