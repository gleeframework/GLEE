# Alice gain: 5800

While Alice's offer is more reasonable given the inflation, I'm hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

The inflation is really starting to hurt. While I would have preferred a more even split, Alice's offer is the best I can realistically hope for at this point. I'm accepting."
