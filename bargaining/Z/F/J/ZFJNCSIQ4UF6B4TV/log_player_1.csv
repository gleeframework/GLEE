"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for my skills! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'm not too thrilled about getting only $18 (20% of $100, after inflation) while Bob gets $80. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 seems fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my potential gain is now $53.20 (40% of $100, after inflation). I'm not thrilled about getting less than half, but I'm willing to consider it.

However, I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more, since I feel like I'm being a bit shortchanged.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a decent share too!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, hoping to get a slightly better deal than the previous offer and get closer to what I think I deserve."
