Alice's offer:

I'm Bob, and while I appreciate the fairness of the proposal, I think I can do better. Let's see what Alice has to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation rates.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we split the money 54/46 in your favor. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the decrease in value. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Alice's offer.  While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt, and this deal offers a decent amount given the circumstances."
