"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this proposal and not risking further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split. This offer ensures we both benefit significantly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with this offer, as I believe I can negotiate for a larger share. Since the money is worth the same to me in each round, I have no incentive to rush into an agreement. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more generous offer""}\n\nI've decreased my initial offer slightly, taking into account that the money is still worth the same to me but is decreasing in value for Bob. I'm trying to create a sense of urgency for Bob to accept, as further rounds will only decrease the value of his potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is of the essence, and inflation is eating away at the value. This offer is a compromise to reach a fair deal quickly. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm still not satisfied with this offer, as I believe I can negotiate for a larger share. Since the money is worth the same to me in each round, I have no incentive to rush into an agreement. Bob's mention of inflation eating away at the value is true, but it affects him, not me. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting you, not me. This is a fair compromise""}\n\nI've decreased my offer slightly again, but I'm still trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth the same to me in each round. I'm emphasizing that inflation is affecting Bob's potential gain, trying to create a sense of urgency for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not willing to accept a 50/50 split, as I believe I have the upper hand in the negotiations. Since the money is worth the same to me in each round, I have no incentive to rush into an agreement. Bob's mention of a ""fair"" split is appealing, but I'm trying to maximize my gain. Considering the significant devaluation of Bob's potential gain due to inflation, I think I can push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 560000, ""bob_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""You're losing value every round. This is a good deal""}\n\nI'm trying to drive home the point that Bob is losing value every round, and that accepting this offer would be a good decision for him. I've decreased my offer slightly, but I'm still trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth the same to me in each round. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that further negotiations will only hurt him more."
