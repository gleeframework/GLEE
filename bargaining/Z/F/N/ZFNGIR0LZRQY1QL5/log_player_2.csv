While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money Alice gains is worth significantly less than in the first round. This means her offers are getting progressively worse for her, increasing Bob's leverage. 
* **Risk of Rejection:** Bob's previous offers were rejected. If he rejects this offer, it's likely Alice will make another offer even more unfavorable to him.
* **Limited Gains:** While Bob isn't getting a huge share, he is getting a significant increase from his previous rejected offer. 

In this scenario, it's better to accept the offer and secure a reasonable gain rather than risk losing out completely due to inflation and Alice's potential for better offers in the future."
