"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping most of it 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm looking at a gain of $400,000, which is still a significant amount. However, I'm not satisfied with the 40/60 split, as I was hoping for a more equal division.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 40/60 split, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split in my favor. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still getting the majority""}

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get the better end of it 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a 46/54 split, which is still not ideal for me. However, I'm willing to consider it since it's slightly better than his previous offer.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more willing to compromise in future rounds.
