60.0,40.0,I propose we split the money 60/40.  It's a fair starting point that allows us both to benefit before inflation eats into our potential gains.,Alice,1,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, your offer undervalues my position given the faster rate of inflation I face. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Let's be reasonable and settle this before our potential gains shrink further.",Alice,3,
