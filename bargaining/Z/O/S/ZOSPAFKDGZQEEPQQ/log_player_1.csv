"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too thrilled about the 45/55 split. I was hoping for a slightly more favorable split.

However, I don't want to prolong the game unnecessarily, and Bob's offer is still a decent one. I'll accept the offer.
