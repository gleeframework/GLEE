"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 300k and keep 700k. You can do better than this?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $475,000 (95% of $500,000).

I don't think I can do better than this offer, so I'll accept.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
