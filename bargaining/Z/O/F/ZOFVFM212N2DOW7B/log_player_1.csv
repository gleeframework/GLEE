"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but it's still a fair starting point. Bob might be tempted to accept, but if he rejects, the inflation will work in my favor in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my previous offer, even with the inflation factor. I'm still in a strong position and can likely get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping the majority of the money. Bob rejected my last offer, and the inflation is working in my favor. However, it's important to keep the negotiation moving forward, so I'm offering a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not as good as my previous offer, even with the inflation factor. I'm still in a good position and can likely get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still keeping the majority of the money.  Bob's offers are getting closer to my initial offer, but they're still not quite there. I'm confident that I can get a better deal if I continue to make offers and let the inflation work in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not as good as my previous offer, even with the inflation factor. It's getting closer to the middle ground, but I can likely still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still confident that I can get a good deal. Bob's offers are getting closer to my initial offer, but they're still not quite there. With the inflation working in my favor, I'm hoping that this offer will be enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a slightly higher share, the inflation is starting to take a serious toll.  Bob's offer is close to a 50/50 split, and the diminishing returns from further rounds make it too risky to reject."
