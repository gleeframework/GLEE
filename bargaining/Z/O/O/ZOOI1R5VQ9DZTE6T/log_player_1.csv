"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, keeping 90% for myself and giving Bob a small share.  This is to see how he reacts and if he's willing to negotiate.  I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better for me than the previous round, but I can still do better. I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, and I believe I can negotiate a more favorable outcome in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 85% for myself and 15% for Bob.  This is a significant jump from my first offer, and I'm hoping that it will be enough to convince Bob to accept. I'm also considering the inflation factor, and I want to secure a larger share before it further diminishes the value of my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming more favorable, but it's still not enough. I'm holding out for a higher share, knowing that the inflation factor is working against both of us, but more so for Bob. I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar offer to the previous round, but slightly decrease my share to 80%.  This is a compromise, and I believe it's a reasonable offer considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good deal and accept, as we are nearing the halfway point of the game and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt now.  Even though this isn't a great deal, it's better than risking getting nothing. I'm taking what I can get at this point."
