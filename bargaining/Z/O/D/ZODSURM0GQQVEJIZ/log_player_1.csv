"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 80-60 split is fair, considering the initial offer was 50-50. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain will be worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 0.8 = 64%). Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering a 32-68 split, which seems more favorable to me given the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
