"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair but firm proposal. I believe we can work something out. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice's offer is very generous to her and does not offer me a fair share. I will counter-propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's be reasonable and come to an agreement.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire for fairness, but a 50/50 split is simply not feasible given the current inflation rates.  I'm willing to compromise, but this is my final offer.  Let's end this quickly before the value of the money drops even further. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, even with the inflation. I will continue to counter-propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
