Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."

# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the decreasing value of my potential gain due to inflation, and Bob's offer is still heavily skewed in his favor. I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more appealing to me.
