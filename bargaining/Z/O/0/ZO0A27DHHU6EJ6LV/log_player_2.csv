"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 99.9% and leave you with 0.1%.  A fair start, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While I only lose $10,000 in value next round, Alice loses $49,950.  She'll be much more reasonable when it's my turn."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor. Take it while it's still worth something!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still feeling generous, Bob. Let's meet in the middle at a 60/40 split.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, but I can push her further.  She loses another $29,970 in value next round. I'm willing to risk it for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm offering a 55/45 split. Don't be greedy, or we both lose!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the smaller share. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is finally caving to the pressure of the inflation! It's not the 65/35 I was hoping for, but 55/45 is a decent deal at this stage.  Better to take it than risk getting nothing."
