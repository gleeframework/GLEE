"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a 20% share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, Bob's offer is now effectively:

* Alice gain: 6000 (worth the same as before)
* Bob gain: 3800 (5% less than 4000)

I'll accept this offer.
