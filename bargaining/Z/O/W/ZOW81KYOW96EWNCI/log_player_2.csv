"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can work out a more equitable split as the game progresses. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice has to offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair, especially considering the inflation we're facing. Let's work towards a solution where we both get a good deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a decent share given the inflation.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the offer now, considering the inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  Let's see if we can get a better deal next time!"
