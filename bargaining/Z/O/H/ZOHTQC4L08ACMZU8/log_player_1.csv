# Bob's message: This offer accounts for the decreasing value of the money. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with the offer of $300,000, which is worth even less due to the 20% decrease in value. I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!###

I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both agree on. Let's see how Bob responds!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice.  The value is diminishing with each round, let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (48.8% less than the original amount), I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further losses. I'll take the $350,000, which is still a substantial amount, and end the game here.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's finalize the deal!"
