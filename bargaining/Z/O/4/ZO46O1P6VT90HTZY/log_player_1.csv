"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll give you a fair chance to negotiate""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small share, but still a chance to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still want a decent share 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is still a 30-70 split, I'll decide to reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 63,
  ""bob_gain"": 37,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I need to get a decent share too""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 63-37 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but still reflects the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's make a deal 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering the reduced value of the money I'll gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my decision-making. Since Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, which is closer to my previous offer, I'll decide to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
