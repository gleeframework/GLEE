"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid a long negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer as I was before.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the division of the money!"
