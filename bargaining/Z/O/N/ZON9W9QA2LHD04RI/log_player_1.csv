"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to accept!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm trying to make a fair offer to start, and I'm giving Bob a chance to accept and end the game early."
