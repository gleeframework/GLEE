"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50/50 split is fair, given that my money is devaluing faster. Let's start with a more equitable distribution.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your money is losing value each round, so a 50/50 split isn't in your best interest. Let's meet in the middle - my previous offer but reversed. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
