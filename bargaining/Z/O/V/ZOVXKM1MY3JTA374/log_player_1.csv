Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 50/50 split is fair, given that my money is devaluing faster. Let's start with a more equitable distribution. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
