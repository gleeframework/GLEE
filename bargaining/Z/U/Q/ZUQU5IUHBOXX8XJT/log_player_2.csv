"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject the offer. While it seems fair now, the inflation will hit Alice much harder than me.  I think I can get a better deal for myself."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than 60/40. Let's split it 60/40, but in my favor this time.  This way, we both get more after the inflation hits.""}

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still going to reject.  Even with the inflation, I think I can get closer to a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm not going to give in to pressure yet."

{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to get closer to 60/40 to make this worthwhile for me with the inflation.  Let's try 65/35, and we can both still come out ahead.""}

# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  Even with the inflation, I think I can get a better split than 50/50. I'm not going to accept this offer yet."
