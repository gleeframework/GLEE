"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to keep 90 dollars for myself and give 10 dollars to Bob.  This way, I maximize my potential gain in the first round, knowing that inflation will affect my share in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy. Due to inflation, my share would decrease in the next round, making it unlikely I could secure a better deal. It's better to secure a 60% share now, rather than risk losing more in the future."
