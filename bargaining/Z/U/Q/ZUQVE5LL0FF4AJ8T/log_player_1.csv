"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll be willing to negotiate and we can reach a better deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split, let's see if you agree 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the decrease in value, I'd rather wait for a better offer. The difference between $7,000 and $3,000 is still quite significant, and I'm not convinced that this is the best deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial offer""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a bit less than what he offered me in round 2, but still a relatively fair split considering the decreased value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll have to reevaluate the offer.

Considering the decreased value, I'm willing to accept this offer. $4,500 is a relatively decent amount for me, and it's a fair compromise considering the circumstances.
