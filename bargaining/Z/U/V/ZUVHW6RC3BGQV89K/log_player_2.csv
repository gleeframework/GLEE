Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is already costing us both. I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too far off.  This offer ensures a more equitable outcome considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000
