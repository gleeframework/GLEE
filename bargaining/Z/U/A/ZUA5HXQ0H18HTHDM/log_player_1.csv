"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now.

I'll think carefully about this offer. Hmm... I don't want to give up too much, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
