"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose a division of $90 for me and $10 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation makes it risky to reject this offer. A 20% loss in value means I'll only get 72 in the next round, and Bob could offer even less. It's better to take the 60 now."
