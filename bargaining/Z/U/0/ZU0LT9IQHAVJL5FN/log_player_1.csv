"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than a 40-60 split. The money is worth less, but I still want a fair share!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 55-45 split. It's my turn to make the proposal, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money's value even more, I'll reassess Bob's offer. Since the money is worth significantly less, I'll consider a slightly higher share for myself to compensate.

However, I'll accept Bob's offer this time:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 45% share, which seems like a reasonable compromise given the reduced value of the money."
