"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I think we can both be happy with this split.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leaving 30 dollars for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 60 dollars is worth 63 dollars in the first round's value, which is 63 / 1.1 = 57.27 in the first round's value. But since the money is worth 10% less now, it's actually worth 57.27 / 1.1 = 52.08 in the current round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
