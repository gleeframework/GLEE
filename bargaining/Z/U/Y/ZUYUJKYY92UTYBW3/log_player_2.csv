"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a good starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal. There are 12 rounds, and I don't know how inflation affects Alice, so I'm willing to take the risk of a few more rounds to see if I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script! I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is fair considering the 12 rounds we have to work with.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're pushing for a 60-40 split? I'll give you a 54-46 split, a fair compromise! 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Alice is now being more reasonable, and while I'd prefer a 60-40 split, a 54-46 split is still a good outcome for me.  I'm not sure how much the inflation will affect Alice's future offers, so it's better to secure a decent share now rather than risk getting less later."
