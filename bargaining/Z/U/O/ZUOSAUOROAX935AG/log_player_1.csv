"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I don't want to accept an equal split now that the money is worth less for me. I want to try to get more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $10,000, leaving $4,000 for Bob."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the money being worth even less for me, I need to consider whether $4,000 is a good deal. Since Bob is offering me the same percentage of the remaining amount as I offered him in Round 3, I'll decide to...

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take the $4,000 and hope that I can do better in future rounds."
