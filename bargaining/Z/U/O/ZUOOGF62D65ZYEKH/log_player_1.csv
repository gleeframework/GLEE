"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it more evenly.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I'm sure you can find it in your heart to be a little more generous. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
