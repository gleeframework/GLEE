"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping to leave room for negotiation and a potential increase in my own share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, my share of $5,000 is now worth $4,500.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with meeting in the middle, considering I was initially offered only $2,000. I'd like to try to negotiate further.
