I'll start by taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  It's a bold move, but I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm willing to compromise a little, but I still want a large majority of the money. It's clear Bob is going to try to take everything, so I need to be assertive and show him I'm not afraid to walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 999990 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is getting ridiculous!  I'm not going to accept being treated like this.  I'll make a better counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm done with this back and forth. I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and the best way to avoid both of us getting nothing."
