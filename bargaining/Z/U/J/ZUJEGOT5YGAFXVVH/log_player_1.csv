"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I deserve a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI made an offer where I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000, with the reasoning that I deserve a bit more. Let's wait for Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose.  Let's be reasonable, this is more than you'd get next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $450,000 is actually equivalent to 0.95 x $450,000 = $427,500 in the first round's value. Considering this, I still think I can get a better deal, especially since Bob is also losing value due to inflation. I will reject Bob's offer.
{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt's now my turn to make another proposal. Here's my next offer:
{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""You're losing more to inflation than I am, be smart""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nAs previously decided, my next offer is:
{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""You're losing more to inflation than I am, be smart""}
Let's see how Bob responds to this proposal.
###\n\nNote: Remember that in this round, the money is worth even less for both of us due to inflation. For me, it's worth 5% less than in the second round, and for Bob, it's worth 10% less than in the second round. This might affect Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hurting us both.  Take this deal before it gets worse for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the value of the money offered by Bob in this round is significantly less than its face value. Since I'm losing 14.26% of the value, Bob's offer of $475,000 is actually equivalent to 0.8574 x $475,000 = $407,015 in the first round's value. For Bob, the loss is even greater, at 27.1%, making his share worth 0.729 x $525,000 = $383,025 in the first round's value.

Given the substantial loss in value due to inflation and considering Bob's eagerness to settle as indicated by his message, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Thus, I will reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Now it's my turn to make another proposal. Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Inflation hurts you more. This is your last chance before it gets much worse.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","As previously decided, my next offer is:
{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Inflation hurts you more. This is your last chance before it gets much worse.""}
Let's see how Bob responds to this proposal, considering the increasing pressure from inflation.
###\n\nNote: At this stage, the impact of inflation is quite significant. For me, the money is worth 19.5% less than in the first round (5% loss each round compounded), and for Bob, it's worth 37.1% less than in the first round (10% loss each round compounded). This difference in loss might make my offer more appealing to Bob, given the rapidly diminishing value of the money for him."
