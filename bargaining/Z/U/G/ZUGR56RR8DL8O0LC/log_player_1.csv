Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split for both of us. We both get a significant portion of the money, and it's a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
