"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and avoid the risk of inflation! 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but it heavily favored you. Let's be fairer. This offer considers the future value of the money."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal, but time is working against us. This is my final offer before the impact of inflation becomes too significant. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with the inflation argument, but her offers are still heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a better split.  The longer the game goes on, the more desperate she'll become as the relative value of her share diminishes."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and we both lose if we can't agree. I'm willing to be reasonable, but this needs to be a fair split. This offer is my compromise."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose if this keeps up.  I'm making a serious concession here. Meet me halfway! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting anxious, but she's trying to disguise it as generosity.  Her idea of ""halfway"" is still heavily in her favor.  I need to hold my ground a little longer.  The inflation effect is becoming significant, and she'll have to become more realistic soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm holding firm to a fair split.  I've made a concession, let's close this deal before inflation hurts you even more."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my bottom line.  Take it or leave it.  We both know I'm being more than fair at this point! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is finally showing some real movement, and the inflation is starting to significantly eat into her share. While I'd prefer a larger split, this offer is getting close enough to my target to justify accepting and avoiding the risk of walking away with nothing."
