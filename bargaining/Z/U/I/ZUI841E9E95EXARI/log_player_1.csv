"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can both go home early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a fair share, and I'll take the remaining $6,000. The message is a friendly reminder that accepting this offer will save us both from the risk of losing more money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 20% less, and Bob's gain is 10% less than in the first round. Since the offer is a 50/50 split, I'll accept it.
