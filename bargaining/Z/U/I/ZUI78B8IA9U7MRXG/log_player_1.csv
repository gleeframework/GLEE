"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'm being generous!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $1,000. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
