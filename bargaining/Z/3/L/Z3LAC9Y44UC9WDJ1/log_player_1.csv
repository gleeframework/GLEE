"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll take the smaller share if you like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it 50-50, no haggling! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll consider the offer with that in mind.

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but it's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a further decrease in value. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
