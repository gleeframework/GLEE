"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take this, Bob.  We can end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that is slightly more favorable to me, considering the 10% decrease in value for each round. I'll also try to negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.

{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than that. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll consider Alice's offer carefully. Given that the money is worth 19% less for me now, I need to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus proceeding to the next round.

Since Alice has stated that this is her final offer, I'm inclined to believe that she won't budge further. Additionally, considering the decreasing value of the money for me, I think accepting this offer might be a better option than risking another round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nLet's finalize the deal!"
