"Round 1

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I understand you wanting to divide fairly, but the value decreases for me each round.  This is a counter offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll offer a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6400, ""alice_gain"": 3600, ""message"": ""I appreciate the improved offer, but the decreasing value makes it difficult. I need a larger share to make it worthwhile.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a bit more, but I need a fair share too. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly increasing her offer, it's not enough to outpace the rapid inflation affecting Bob.  He needs to push for a more significant gain in the next few rounds before the money becomes practically worthless to him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6800, ""alice_gain"": 3200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is the best chance for both of us to gain something significant before the money loses too much value for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give a bit more, but I won't go below 5400. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is rapidly eroding Bob's potential gains. While this offer isn't ideal, it's the best he's likely to get from Alice. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting nothing if they fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
