"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k, you can't go wrong with that!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a generous offer, I'll try to meet you in the middle this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was expecting a counteroffer, but I suppose ""meeting in the middle"" is a good compromise.

I accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
