Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think we can both do better. This offer is much fairer, and allows us both to walk away with a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
