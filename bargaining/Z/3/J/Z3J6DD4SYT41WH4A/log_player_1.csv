"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose taking 999,000 for myself and leaving 1,000 for Bob.  While I want the majority of the money, I believe this is a fair starting point as it gives Bob some incentive to accept rather than risking getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than what he offered in the first round, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject this offer and see what he proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 900,000 for myself, but still giving Bob a substantial share of 100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer given the inflation, and I hope he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is not ideal, it's still a significant sum of money, and the inflation is making the potential gains in future rounds increasingly uncertain. I'm going to accept this offer and secure a large portion of the money."
