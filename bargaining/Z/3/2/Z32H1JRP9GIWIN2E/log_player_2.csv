Let's see if Alice is willing to offer more. I'm in no rush to accept a 40/60 split."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet in the middle of our last offers 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is closer to my ideal split, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not in a rush to accept, especially with the inflation impacting Alice more significantly than me."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight advantage since inflation is hitting you harder. Let's settle for a 55/45 split. This is a good compromise that allows us to both gain something before the money loses more value.""}
