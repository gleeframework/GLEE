"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""} \n\nIn this offer, I propose to take $600,000 and leave $400,000 for Bob. Given that the value of money decreases with each round, it's in both our interests to reach an agreement as soon as possible. I've chosen a 60-40 split as a starting point, hoping that Bob will see it as a reasonable offer and accept it, ending the game quickly before the value of the money drops further. The message ""Let's be fair"" is meant to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the proposal without feeling the need to negotiate further. \n\n### \n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. \n\n### \n\n(Note: Remember, after this round, if Bob decides to proceed, the money's value will decrease by 20% for me and 10% for him.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This is a fair starting point and allows us both to maximize our gains before the inflation kicks in. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting a 50-50 split in the second round would mean I'm getting significantly less value than if we had agreed on my initial 60-40 proposal. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'm motivated to try and negotiate a better deal, hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise further to avoid additional rounds and more inflation. By rejecting this offer, I aim to pressure Bob into a more favorable split in the next round, leveraging the fact that further delays will continue to devalue the money for both of us, but more so for me."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle of our last offers""} \n\nConsidering the last two offers, I'm trying to find a middle ground that would be acceptable to Bob while still favoring me slightly, given the higher rate of inflation affecting my share. By proposing a 58-42 split, I'm moving closer to Bob's 50-50 suggestion but still pushing for a bit more, leveraging the urgency of reaching an agreement before the value of the money drops even further. The message ""Meet in the middle of our last offers"" is intended to convey a sense of compromise and reasonableness, encouraging Bob to accept this offer and conclude the negotiations. \n\n### \n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision. \n\n### \n\n(Note: Remember, after this round, if Bob decides to proceed, the money's value will decrease by another 20% for me and another 10% for him.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight advantage since inflation is hitting you harder. Let's settle for a 55/45 split. This is a good compromise that allows us to both gain something before the money loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money I can gain, Bob's offer of a 45-55 split in his favor actually translates to a better real value for me compared to further rounds. Given that the money is now worth 48.8% less for me than in the first round, and it will continue to devalue, accepting this offer seems like the most prudent decision. It allows me to secure a share of the money before its value drops even further. The compromise Bob offers, taking into account the different rates of inflation affecting us, is reasonable under the circumstances, making acceptance the best choice to maximize my real gains."
