"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 70 and you can take 30.""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again, I'll meet you halfway this time! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Let's move on to the next round.
