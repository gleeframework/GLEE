I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept quickly. I'm taking a gamble that he doesn't know about the inflation, so he might be more likely to take what he can get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though the inflation is hitting me harder, a 50/50 split is a much better deal than the previous offer. It's better to secure a fair share now rather than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
