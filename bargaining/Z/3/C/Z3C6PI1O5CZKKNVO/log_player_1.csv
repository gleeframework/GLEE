Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split. I'm willing to accept a bit less to get things going. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need a larger share to make it worth my time. Let's try this.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be fair, but time is running out. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I prefer a larger share, it's better to take the offer now than risk getting nothing in later rounds due to the increasing inflation affecting Bob's share."
