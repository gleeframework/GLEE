"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You get a smaller share, but I'll make it worth your while""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm trying to entice Bob with the promise of a smaller share, but still a significant one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll need to reassess the offer.

In this round, Bob is offering a 75-25 split, with him getting $700,000 and me getting $300,000. Considering the value of the money for Bob is decreasing by 5% each round, I'm not sure if I want to accept a larger share for him now.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. A 55-45 split is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. This is a more moderate offer, and I'm hoping Bob will find it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is still a bit too skewed towards you. I'll meet you at 52.5-47.5 this time. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I'll need to reassess the offer.

In this round, Bob is offering a 52.5-47.5 split, with him getting $550,000 and me getting $450,000. Considering the value of the money for Bob is decreasing significantly, I think this offer is a good compromise. I'll accept the offer.
