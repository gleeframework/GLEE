Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit frustrated with these low offers. I think I deserve more, and I'm willing to take a risk to get it. This is my last chance to make a decent deal. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all with further rejections."
