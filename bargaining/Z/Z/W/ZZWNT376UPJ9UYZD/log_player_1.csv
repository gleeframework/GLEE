"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I am the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $190,000 and keep $810,000 for myself.  While I'd prefer more, I need to consider the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my previous offer.  This seems like a fair compromise given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject this offer. Even though inflation is hurting me significantly, I think I can get a better deal if we continue.  Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm hoping he will come around to a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm offering Bob $271,000 and keeping $729,000 for myself. Inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm still confident that I can get a better deal than Bob's previous offer. This feels like a good balance between maximizing my share and making an offer that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd love to keep negotiating, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains quickly.  This offer is significantly better than Bob's previous proposals, and with the rate of inflation, it's likely I won't get a better deal in the next round. It's time to accept and secure some of this money."
