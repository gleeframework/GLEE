**Reasoning:**

While the inflation is hurting me more, Alice is getting greedier. Accepting $40 now is better than nothing in Round 12, but I still have room to negotiate. Alice's offer is getting worse, and she needs to realize I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be real, the inflation is hurting both of us. 50/50 is the only fair outcome.""}
