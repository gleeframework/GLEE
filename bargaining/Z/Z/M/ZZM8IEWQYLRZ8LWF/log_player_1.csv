Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable compromise considering the time pressure and the fact that my losses are greater than yours due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both of us. Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller overall pie to split. 
* **Bob's Position:** Bob is experiencing a much higher inflation rate (20% per round) compared to Alice (10% per round). This means he's incentivized to settle sooner. His ""final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to budge much further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk. There's no guarantee Alice can secure a better deal in Round 5. Bob might propose an even less favorable split, and the overall value will continue to shrink. 

Accepting the 450,000 in Round 4 guarantees Alice a reasonable sum, even if it's not the initial 700,000 she aimed for. It's a pragmatic choice in the face of a shrinking pot and a time-sensitive situation."
