"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I'll get 60 dollars, and Bob will get 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 dollars is now worth 36 dollars, and Bob's gain of 60 dollars is still 60 dollars. I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 9% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

This way, I'll get a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount considering the inflation."
