"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice
I'll start by proposing a division that seems relatively fair, with a slight bias towards myself, as is common in negotiation tactics. I'll also include a message that suggests flexibility and openness to negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Starting point, open to adjustments""
}
```

This offer gives me $55 and Bob $45, along with a message indicating that this is just an initial proposal and I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I think a 60/40 split is more equitable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice
Given Bob's offer of a 60/40 split in his favor, I need to consider whether accepting $40 is satisfactory for me. Since I started with an offer that was slightly biased towards myself but still relatively fair, and Bob has countered with an offer that tips the balance significantly in his favor, I feel that accepting this would be conceding too much ground without attempting to find a middle ground closer to my initial proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

By rejecting this offer, I aim to continue the negotiation to see if we can find a compromise that is closer to the middle ground between our initial offers."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Alice
Considering Bob's aggressive counteroffer and my initial attempt at a fair division, for my next offer, I'll adjust my proposal slightly to demonstrate a willingness to compromise but still aim for a division that is closer to being equitable.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway from my first offer""
}
```

This offer reduces my share from $55 to $52 and increases Bob's share from $45 to $48, indicating a move towards finding a middle ground while still advocating for a slightly higher share due to the initial concession."
