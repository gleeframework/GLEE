Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. I need to hold out for a better deal, but time is running out!"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see. But I'll give you a chance to end this 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Alice is clearly playing hardball.  Let's analyze:

* **Time:**  We have 5 rounds left. If I reject, I need to be prepared to potentially accept an even worse offer in the later rounds due to the increasing inflation.
* **Inflation:** A 40/60 split right now is already bad due to the 26.49% inflation hit I'm taking. It will only get worse. 

I need to make a decision based on how likely I think Alice is to accept a counter-offer. If I reject this, she might offer me even less next round thinking I'm desperate.

{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's a painful decision, but it's better to take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing at all."
