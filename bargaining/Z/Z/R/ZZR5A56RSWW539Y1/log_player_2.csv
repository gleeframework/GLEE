Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but we need to find a split that is more beneficial for both of us in the long run. This is a fair offer that takes into account the risk of further inflation.

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While she's offering slightly more than before, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid inflation for me. It's worth the risk to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
