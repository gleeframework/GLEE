"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us receiving $500,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Here's my response:

{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I deserve a better share. I was hoping for a more even split, and giving me only $300,000 is too low. I'll let Bob know that I'm willing to consider a compromise, but I need a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about we meet in the middle?""
}

I'm proposing a slightly more even split, with me getting $400,000 and Bob getting $600,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give you that much, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than before. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer again! I was hoping for a better deal, but it seems like he's still trying to take the lion's share. Here's my response:

{
""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because I think I deserve more than $200,000. I was hoping for a more substantial increase from his previous offer, and this one is still too low. I'll keep negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. Let's meet in the middle again.""
}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's fair for both of us, and I hope Bob will consider this offer."
