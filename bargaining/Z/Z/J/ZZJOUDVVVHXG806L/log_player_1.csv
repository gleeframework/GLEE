"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the Initial Offer
Given that there are 12 rounds and the goal is to divide $100 between Alice and Bob, the initial offer should be strategic. Offering exactly half might seem fair but starting with a slight bias towards Alice could provide room for negotiation without being too unfair.

### Step 2: Consider the Strategic Approach
A strategic approach would be to start with an offer that is slightly favorable to Alice but not so biased that Bob would refuse outright. Considering the number of rounds, there's room for negotiation, but being too greedy early on could lead to no agreement at all.

### Step 3: Calculate the Offer
Given the strategic considerations, let's propose that Alice takes slightly more than half, but not so much as to alienate Bob. A 55-45 split seems like a reasonable starting point. This shows willingness to negotiate while also trying to maximize Alice's gain.

### Step 4: Craft the Message
The message to Bob should be concise and indicate a willingness to negotiate further if this offer isn't acceptable. Something like, ""Starting point for negotiation. Open to adjustments.""

### Step 5: Finalize the Offer and Message
Based on the above steps, the offer and message would be as follows:

- Alice's gain: $55
- Bob's gain: $45
- Message: ""Starting point for negotiation. Open to adjustments.""

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Starting point for negotiation. Open to adjustments.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm open to discussing adjustments if you have any thoughts. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's Offer\nBob has offered a 50-50 split, which is a perfectly fair offer. Given that we started with a slightly biased offer towards Alice and Bob has immediately countered with an equal split, it suggests Bob is aiming for fairness but may also be open to slight adjustments based on his message.

### Step 2: Consider the Negotiation Strategy\nSince Bob's offer is exactly in the middle, accepting it immediately might close off opportunities for slightly better offers in subsequent rounds. However, rejecting it outright for minimal potential gain could risk alienating Bob or leading to less favorable offers in the future.

### Step 3: Weigh the Risks and Benefits\nThe risk of not accepting the 50-50 offer is that future offers might not be as favorable. However, Bob's message suggests he is open to adjustments, implying there might be room for slight improvements. The benefit of holding out could be a marginally better deal, but this needs to be weighed against the risk of ending up with nothing if no agreement is reached within the 12 rounds.

### Step 4: Make a Decision\nGiven the fairness of Bob's offer and the openness to adjustments, a cautious approach might be to accept the offer, especially since it aligns with a fair and equal split. However, considering the game's structure and the potential for slight improvements, a strategic decision might lean towards exploring those possibilities, especially given Bob's expressed openness to adjustments.

### Step 5: Finalize the Decision\nAfter weighing the options, the decision is to reject Bob's offer, not because it's unfair, but because there's an expressed willingness to discuss adjustments, which might yield a slightly better outcome for Alice.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Reconsider the Approach\nGiven that Bob offered a 50-50 split and indicated openness to adjustments, the next offer from Alice should take this into account. The goal is to make an offer that is still favorable to Alice but acknowledges Bob's desire for fairness and his willingness to negotiate.

### Step 2: Calculate a New Offer\nConsidering the previous offers and Bob's stance, a slight adjustment from the initial offer might be more acceptable. Instead of a 55-45 split, a 52-48 split could be seen as a compromise, showing that Alice is also willing to negotiate and is moving closer to Bob's preferred equal split.

### Step 3: Craft a New Message\nThe message should reflect Alice's willingness to compromise and her openness to further negotiations. It should also acknowledge Bob's offer and show that Alice is moving towards a mutually acceptable agreement. A message like, ""Moving closer to the middle. Hoping this is more acceptable,"" could convey this intent.

### Step 4: Finalize the New Offer and Message\nBased on the reconsideration and calculation, the new offer would be slightly more favorable to Bob than the initial one but still leans towards Alice's advantage. The message would convey a sense of compromise and openness to further discussion.

### Step 5: Send the Offer\nThe offer and message would be as follows:

- Alice's gain: $52
- Bob's gain: $48
- Message: ""Moving closer to the middle. Hoping this is more acceptable.""

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Moving closer to the middle. Hoping this is more acceptable.""}"
