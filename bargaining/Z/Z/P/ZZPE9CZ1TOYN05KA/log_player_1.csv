"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering a generous 9000 to myself, and 1000 to Bob. This is a high offer for me, but I want to see if Bob will accept it. I'm also considering the possibility of inflation, and want to secure a large share for myself early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though my share is significantly reduced due to inflation, it's still better than getting nothing if we continue to the next round. I'm taking the offer."
