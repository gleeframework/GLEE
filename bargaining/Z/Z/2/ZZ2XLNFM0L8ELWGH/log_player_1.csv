Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, this is a more balanced offer. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is still the most fair considering the inflation. I'm willing to stick to it for now.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation factor by offering slightly better deals over time, hoping I'll panic and accept a less favorable split. 
* **My Strategy:**  I need to remain firm with my initial offer for a few reasons:
    * **Value Loss:**  While Bob sees no decrease, my $6,000 is rapidly losing value. Accepting $5,500 now would be a significant loss compared to my initial ask.
    * **Time Pressure:**  Bob is unaffected by the time pressure, but every round costs me potential earnings.
    * **Calculated Risk:** By sticking to my offer, I'm betting that Bob will eventually realize accepting a 60/40 split is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds where my demands will likely increase due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is really taking its toll now, let's settle on this. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Strong:** While the inflation is becoming a bigger factor, I need to hold strong for at least one more round. Accepting $5,200 now would be significantly less than my initial goal. 
* **Shifting Power Dynamic:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure and sweetening the deal. This means my strategy of sticking to a consistent offer is likely working. 
* **Anticipating Round 5:** In the next round, the inflation impact will be even more severe. This puts me in a stronger position to either push for a return to my original offer or negotiate a slightly better deal than what Bob is offering now."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""The inflation is really hurting my end, Bob. I need a better deal to make this worthwhile - let's avoid dragging this out any further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The devaluation is significant at this point. I need to significantly increase my ask to compensate.
* **Sense of Urgency:** I'm conveying that this deal needs to close soon, or I'll be forced to be even more demanding.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  While my ask is higher, it's still within the realm of negotiation. This offer signals flexibility while also highlighting the urgency created by the inflation. 

**The Goal:** My ideal scenario is Bob realizing the deal is slipping away and accepting this offer. If not, I'll be in a stronger position to negotiate from this higher baseline in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is severely impacting your end, I think this is a more realistic offer now. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Tipping Point:** The inflation has reached a critical point. Accepting $4,800 now is significantly less than my initial goal, but it's better than risking even further devaluation in the next round.
* **Power Shift:** Bob has successfully leveraged the inflation to shift the power dynamic in his favor. He's now offering me less than I would have gotten in earlier rounds.
* **Minimizing Losses:** While not ideal, accepting this offer cuts my losses.  Continuing to push my luck could result in even less favorable outcomes as the rounds progress."
