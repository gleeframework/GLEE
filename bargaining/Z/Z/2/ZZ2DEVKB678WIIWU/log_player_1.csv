Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk due to inflation, but I still think this is a reasonable offer. Let's close the deal! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, but it's still in his favor considering the inflation working against him. By continuing to reject, I increase the pressure on him to offer a larger share to avoid losing out as inflation diminishes the value of his potential gains."
