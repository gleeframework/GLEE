Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 420000

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases for me due to inflation. I need to secure a reasonable amount quickly.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice seems to be aiming for a larger share but is willing to negotiate. My previous offer was slightly better for me than hers, so I'm moving closer to the middle ground. 
* **Finality:**  By framing this as my ""best and final"" offer, I'm hoping to add pressure on Alice to accept before the value decreases further for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer to what I want 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer this goes on, the less money I'll actually get due to inflation.  Waiting another round could cost me significantly.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice seems quite set on getting a larger share. It's unlikely she'll budge much further, and I risk getting an even worse offer in future rounds. 
* **Acceptable Loss:** While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting now ensures I at least get a decent amount ($450,000), even with the impact of inflation."
