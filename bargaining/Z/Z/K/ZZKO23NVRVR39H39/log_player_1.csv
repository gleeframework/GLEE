"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer to ensure a favorable outcome.
Given the rules of the game, it's essential to consider the impact of inflation on my proposals and the fact that Bob does not experience inflation. This means that with each round, the value of the money decreases for me but remains constant for Bob.

### Step 2: Calculate the optimal initial offer.
Since I am Alice, I want to maximize my gain while considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. A common strategy in such games is to start with an offer that is slightly favorable to oneself but not so extreme that the other player refuses it outright. However, given the specific conditions of this game, including the inflation aspect, I need to be more aggressive in my initial offer to account for the loss in value over rounds.

### Step 3: Consider the psychological aspect of the offer.
Bob might be more inclined to accept an offer that seems fair or slightly generous, considering the alternative is to proceed with the game, risking getting a worse deal later. However, knowing that the money's value decreases for me and not for him might make him more inclined to wait for a better offer.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer.
Given these considerations, a reasonable initial offer could be to propose a division where I, Alice, receive a slightly larger share to account for the future loss in value but not so large that Bob is unwilling to accept. However, considering the unique dynamics of this game, especially the inflation aspect that affects me and not Bob, I will propose an offer that reflects a more strategic approach.

### Step 5: Attach a persuasive message.
The message should be concise and aim to persuade Bob to accept the offer by highlighting the benefits of accepting now rather than risking further negotiations.

### Step 6: Finalize the offer and message in JSON format.
Given the unique conditions and the strategic need to balance between being too greedy and accounting for inflation, I decide on the following offer:

```
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Accept now and avoid the risk of getting less in the next rounds.""
}
```

This offer reflects a strategic balance, considering the game's conditions and the need to persuade Bob to accept the proposal.

The final answer is: $\boxed{60}$"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get a better deal for myself. Let's see what happens in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the impact of inflation on the current offer.
Given that the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, I need to adjust my perception of Bob's offer accordingly. The offer of $40 for me in the second round is actually equivalent to $36 in the first round's value.

### Step 2: Compare the offer with the expected outcome of further negotiation.
Considering the decreasing value of money for me with each round, I must assess whether accepting this offer now is more beneficial than risking further rounds. Each additional round decreases the value of my potential gain by 10%, making future offers potentially less valuable, even if the nominal amount is the same.

### Step 3: Consider the strategic implications of accepting or rejecting the offer.
Accepting this offer means securing a known quantity now, albeit a reduced value due to inflation. Rejecting the offer and proceeding to the next round introduces uncertainty, as Bob may offer a worse deal or a marginally better one, but the value will decrease regardless due to inflation.

### Step 4: Determine the best course of action.
Given the current offer and the impact of inflation, accepting the offer might be the most prudent decision. The decreasing value of money with each round means that even if Bob offers a nominally better deal in the next round, the actual value might be lower.

### Step 5: Formulate the response.
Based on the analysis, I will accept Bob's offer to ensure a known outcome rather than risking a potentially less valuable deal in future rounds due to inflation.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
