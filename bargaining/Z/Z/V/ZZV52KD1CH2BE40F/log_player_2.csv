"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This is a fair offer considering the time pressure and inflation we are facing. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's worth a shot to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fairer split, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's settle this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I understand you want the larger share, but my position weakens considerably with each round. 55/45 is a compromise that still gives you a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's getting risky to keep rejecting, and 45 is still a decent gain."
