"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a generous offer, but I think I can do better. Let's see if you'll take this one. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that when making my decision.

In this round, my gain of $100,000 is actually worth $95,000 (95% of $100,000). Meanwhile, Bob's gain of $900,000 is still worth $900,000.

Considering the inflation effect, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll reject it for now and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'm not afraid to make a counteroffer. Let's see if you'll take this one.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give you more than 45% of the original amount. You'll have to do better than that if you want me to accept. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my potential gain in this round. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In the first round, $1,000,000 was worth $1,000,000. In the fourth round, it's worth 85.74% of that, which is $857,400. Bob's offer of $450,000 is worth 52.55% of the original amount, which is $522,000.

Considering the inflation effect, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to lowball me, but I'm not backing down. I'll meet you in the middle, but that's as low as I'll go.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up more than 45% of the original amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give you the majority, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the low end. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my potential gain in this round. Since the money I gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In the first round, $1,000,000 was worth $1,000,000. In the sixth round, it's worth 77.38% of that, which is $770,400. Bob's offer of $400,000 is worth 52.05% of the original amount, which is $520,500.

Considering the inflation effect, I think this offer is a bit better than the previous ones, but I'm still not convinced that it's the best I can get. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal.

  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""You're not budging, but I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm hoping you'll see this as a reasonable compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that balances my gain and Bob's gain. Since the inflation effect is still reducing the value of my potential gain, I'm aiming for a slightly higher percentage of the original amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit more aggressive, but I still think this is a fair split. You're not getting more than 30% of the original amount, so take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of my potential gain in this round. Since the money I gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In the first round, $1,000,000 was worth $1,000,000. In the eighth round, it's worth 69.83% of that, which is $694,300. Bob's offer of $300,000 is worth 30% of the original amount, which is $300,000.

Considering the inflation effect, I think this offer is a bit too aggressive on Bob's part. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal.

  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up more than 50% of the original amount. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can finalize a deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us. Since the inflation effect is still reducing the value of my potential gain, I'm aiming for a higher percentage of the original amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
