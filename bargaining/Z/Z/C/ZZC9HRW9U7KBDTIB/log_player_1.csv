"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer was too low. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal, considering the inflation. I'd like to propose my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and share the money equally, considering the reduced value due to inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing an equal split, which I think is a fair compromise, given the decreased value of the money due to inflation."
