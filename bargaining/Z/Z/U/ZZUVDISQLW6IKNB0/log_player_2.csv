Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk getting nothing. Inflation is killing me! 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is becoming more desperate.  While her offer isn't terrible, I think I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two before she becomes truly desperate."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer before the inflation eats up any chance of a decent agreement for you.""}"
