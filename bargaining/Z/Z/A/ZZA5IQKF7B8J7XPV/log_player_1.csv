This offer is still favorable to me, considering the inflation. Let's see if Bob accepts!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

Even though the offer is significantly less than what I initially aimed for, I'm realizing that the inflation is drastically reducing the value of the money with each round. It's better to take this offer than risk getting even less in the future."
