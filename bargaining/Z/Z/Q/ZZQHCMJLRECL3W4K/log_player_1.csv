"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping the remaining $900,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I have the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is more attractive now. I'll consider it carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer."
