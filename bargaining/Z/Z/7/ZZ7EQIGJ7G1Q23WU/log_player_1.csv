"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

Initially, Bob's offer is 50/50 split, which is a fair offer. However, considering the inflation, I'll be gaining $4,000 (20% less than the $5,000 Bob's offer) and Bob will gain $5,000.

I'll reject the offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the total amount is now $8,000 (10,000 * 0.8). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's see if we can find a middle ground!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $8,000, leaving Bob with $3,200. This is a slightly more aggressive offer than my first one, but still relatively fair considering the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, Alice. Let's see if this works! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less each round, and we're on the 4th round, the total amount is now $6,400 (10,000 * 0.8^4). Considering the inflation, my gain would be worth 51.2% of the original amount, which is $5,184 (10,000 * 0.512).

Bob's offer is for me to gain $4,000, which is 62.5% of the original amount, and Bob gains $6,000.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal for me than my previous offers.
