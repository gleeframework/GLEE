"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! I'll get a much better deal if I wait."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. 60/40 is a fair starting point for this round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to wear me down, but that's still a bad deal for me, especially with the inflation working against me!  I need to hold out for a better split."
