"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this 100,000 and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to settle for a measly $100,000. Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. 60/40 split, and we both get a decent amount. We can avoid any further inflation and get this done.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a bigger share, but after the inflation, I'm still taking a hit. Let's compromise with a 70/30 split, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt.  A 70/30 split is still a decent gain for me, and it's better than risking further losses with more rounds."
