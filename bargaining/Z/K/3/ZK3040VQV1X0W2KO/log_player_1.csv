"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, giving Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept.  I'm also trying to maximize my gains in the first round before the inflation takes effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in later rounds due to inflation. My gains are still significant, and accepting avoids the uncertainty of further rounds."
