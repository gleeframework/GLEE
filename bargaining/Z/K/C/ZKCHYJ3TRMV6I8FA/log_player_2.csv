Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  Let's do 60/40, I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  This seems like a reasonable split, and we can avoid the risk of further inflation.
