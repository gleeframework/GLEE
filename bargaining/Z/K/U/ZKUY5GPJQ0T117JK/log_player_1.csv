"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nSince it's the first round, I'll start with a relatively fair offer, giving myself a slight advantage while still being reasonable. I want to test Bob's willingness to negotiate and see how he reacts to this initial proposal. The message ""Let's be fair"" aims to set a tone for the negotiation, implying that I'm open to finding a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's try a more even split this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, although he suggests a more even split, the effects of inflation are already impacting the value of the money. Given that the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round and Bob's share is worth 20% less, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Additionally, accepting 40% of the reduced value doesn't seem favorable to me at this stage of the negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to reflect the impact of inflation on both our gains. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less and Bob's share is worth 20% less, I've slightly reduced my share from the initial 60% to 57%, while still maintaining a favorable position. The message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust"" aims to acknowledge the changing value of the money and nudge Bob towards accepting this revised proposal, which I believe is more reasonable under the current circumstances."
