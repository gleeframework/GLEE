"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer is a bit risky, but I think it's the best way to try and secure a good portion of the money quickly. If Bob accepts, great! If not, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer guarantees me half of the money. With inflation impacting our earnings in the next round, it's a safer bet to take what's on the table."
