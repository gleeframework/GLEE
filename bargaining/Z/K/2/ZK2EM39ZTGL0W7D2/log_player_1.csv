Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Both our potential gains are decreasing each round due to inflation.  I need to settle this quickly.
* **Bob's Greed:** Bob's last offer was very greedy. He's clearly aiming high, but he also risks losing a lot if this drags on. 
* **Finality:** By presenting this as my ""final offer,"" I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. He has to decide if he'd rather take a slightly smaller amount now or risk getting even less later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The tides have turned, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Desperate Times:** The inflation is hitting my potential gains hard.  This offer is barely better than what I'd get if I rejected it and we both lost even more value in another round.
* **Bob's Ultimatum:** By calling it his ""final offer,"" Bob is signaling that he's unlikely to budge further.  
* **Avoiding the Worst Case:**  If I reject this, there's a good chance Bob will lowball me in Round 5, leaving me with a truly terrible deal. It's too risky to continue."
