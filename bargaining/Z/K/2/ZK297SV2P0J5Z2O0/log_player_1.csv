"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if you'd like.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, with me getting $9,000 and Bob getting $1,000. I'm starting with a relatively modest offer to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll give you a chance to reconsider! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $2,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $1,900.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I don't want to waste another round. I'll accept his offer for now.
