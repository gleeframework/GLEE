"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair and balanced split to try to get Bob to accept."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the offer from Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll wait for a better deal. 50-50 is not as attractive as it sounds.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a fair split, the money is worth less than it was in the first round, and I'd like to get a better deal."

}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $10,000, which is $5,500, and leaving $4,500 for Bob. I'm framing it as a slightly better deal than the 50-50 split Bob previously offered, to try to get him to accept."

}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a slightly better deal than my previous offer, I still think I can get a better deal from Bob. I'm not convinced that this is his last offer, and I'd like to see if he's willing to give me more."

}
```

I'm offering to take 58% of the remaining $10,000, which is $5,800, and leaving $4,200 for Bob. I'm framing it as a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer, and I'm hinting that I'm getting impatient to get a deal done."

  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think this is a fair deal, and I'm willing to take it. You've been a tough negotiator, Bob!""
