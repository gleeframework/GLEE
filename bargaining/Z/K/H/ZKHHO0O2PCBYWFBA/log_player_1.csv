"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go along.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. We can continue to adjust as the game progresses. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 45-55 split. I was hoping for a slightly more favorable split for myself, considering I was willing to start with a fair split in the first round. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
