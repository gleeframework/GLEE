"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can propose a better offer in the next round if you want.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, or $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's see if you accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, my share of $50 is actually worth $50 x 0.9 = $45.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
