Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a larger share. Let's split it 80/20. If you reject this, we'll both lose money in the next round, so think carefully. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the pressure is on, Alice is still pushing for a very uneven split. I need to hold my ground a bit longer."

# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
