"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 6000 / 0.9 = 6666.67
Bob gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44

I'll accept this offer.
