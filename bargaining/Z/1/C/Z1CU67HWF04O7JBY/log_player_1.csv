"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. Take this generous offer and avoid the effects of inflation.""
}
``` 

This offer heavily favors Alice, but the message aims to frame it as a reasonable starting point. The goal is to make Bob consider the looming inflation and potentially accept a less favorable deal now rather than risk getting even less later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, Alice, but I'm aiming for a more equitable split. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is framed as more ""equitable,"" it significantly favors him. It's crucial to remember that the value of the money decreases for Bob at a faster rate than for Alice. By rejecting this offer, Alice puts pressure on Bob to offer a larger share in the next round to avoid losing even more value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  Inflation is working against you. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer takes a more aggressive stance, reflecting the changing power dynamic due to inflation. 

* **Increased Share:** Alice has significantly increased her demanded share, reflecting the decreasing value of the money for Bob. 
* **Framing:** The message highlights the time pressure on Bob, reminding him that every round makes the deal worse for him. 
* **Potential for Agreement:** While this offer is still in Alice's favor, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate a slightly better deal for himself in a potential counter-offer. This avoids being overly aggressive and potentially pushing Bob away from a deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want a significant share.  This is my final offer, let's end this before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but ultimately rejecting is still the better strategy. Here's why:

* **Inflation is working in Alice's favor:**  While Bob is right that inflation is eroding the value for both players, it's impacting him much faster. Every round that passes gives Alice more negotiating power.
* **Bob is feeling the pressure:**  His message indicates a sense of urgency (""final offer,"" ""before inflation eats away""). This implies he's willing to make concessions to avoid further losses. 
* **A better deal is likely:** By rejecting, Alice forces Bob to make the next offer. Given his increasing urgency, he'll likely have to significantly improve his offer to convince Alice to accept. 

It's a gamble, as there's always the risk Bob walks away. However, given the current dynamics and Bob's displayed anxiety, Alice is in a strong position to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it now, or the deal will only get worse for you. I'm willing to walk away with nothing if you reject this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a calculated risk, but one that has a high chance of success:

* **Strategic Compromise:**  Alice is offering a slightly more even split than her previous offers, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still heavily in her favor.
* **Strong Message:** By stating this is her final offer and she's willing to walk away, Alice is applying maximum pressure on Bob. This signals seriousness and commitment to her position.
* **Inflation Factor:** Bob is now losing almost 20% of the value with each passing round. The longer this drags on, the less appealing his potential gains become. 

It's a gamble, as Bob might call Alice's bluff. However, the combination of a reasonable offer, a strong message, and the looming threat of inflation makes it likely that Bob will accept, giving Alice a significant advantage in the final split."
