"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll take the risk of negotiating further""
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but I'm leaving room for Bob to negotiate and potentially get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it 50-50 just yet. I'd like to keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still want more""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value fast!

I'll think carefully... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a deal that gives Bob a larger share. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting any younger""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to hold onto a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting any younger either 
# Alice gain: 485000 
# Bob gain: 515000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly!

I'll think carefully... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've squeezed out as much as I can. This offer is a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money losing even more value."
