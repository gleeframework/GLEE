"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.

```
