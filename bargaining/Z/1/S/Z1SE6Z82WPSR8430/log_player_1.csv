"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and keeping $800,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

Considering the inflation, my $800,000 from the first round is now worth 95% of its original value, and Bob's $200,000 is now worth 90% of its original value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'd be giving up a larger share of the original amount, but it's worth less due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 95% of its value from the previous round, and the money Bob gains is worth 90% of its value from the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, and keeping $550,000 for myself. It's a bit more generous than my previous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this time!"
