"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm offering Bob 60% of the total amount, and I'll take the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept Bob's offer this time, since it's my turn to make a proposal next and I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation.

```
