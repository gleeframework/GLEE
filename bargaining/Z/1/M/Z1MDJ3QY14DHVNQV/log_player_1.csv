Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty lopsided deal in my favor.  Since I'm the first to offer, I'm going to try and maximize my share.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting a much smaller share than my original offer, it's still better than nothing. The inflation would make my share even smaller if I rejected this offer and went to the next round. It's time to take what I can get!"
