"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob is a 50-50 split. Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

My gain would be 5000, which is worth 80% of the original 6000 I would have gotten in the first round. That's a decent compromise, considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
