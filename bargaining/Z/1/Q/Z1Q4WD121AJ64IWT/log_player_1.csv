{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."

# Bob's message: You were too generous last round, I'll take a bit more this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'm losing more than I gained in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
