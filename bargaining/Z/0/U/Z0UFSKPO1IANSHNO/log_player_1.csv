"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 40/60 split. I'd like to aim for a more even split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. This 55/45 split is a fairer deal for me.""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split in my favor slightly, while still being reasonable. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice. This 65/35 split is a better deal for me. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 65/35 split. I'd like to aim for a more even split, and I'm not convinced that this offer is a significant enough improvement from my previous proposal. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. This 60/40 split is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and not giving up too much. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on the 65/35 split, Alice. It's the best I can do. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the value of my potential gains!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 65/35 split, especially not at this stage of the game. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal, but I'm starting to get concerned that I might end up with very little if I don't make a good move soon. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. This 65/35 split is as close to even as I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm trying to get as close to an even split as possible, but I'm not willing to give up more than I have to. Let's see how Bob responds!"
