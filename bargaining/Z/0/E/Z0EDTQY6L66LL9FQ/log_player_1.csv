"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but I'm open to negotiations. What's your move?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $750,000, and Bob gets the remaining $250,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm willing to give you a good chunk of the money, but I need a fair share as well.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of the original amount, so it's actually $320,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, considering I could have gotten $750,000 in the first round. But I'll consider Bob's message and the fact that he's being generous with his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my gain is now worth 64% of the original amount, so I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I still think I deserve a bigger share. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. This is a fair deal, and we both get a decent share before things get worse. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are biting!

With inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 40% of the original amount, so it's actually $400,000. I'm not thrilled about the idea of splitting it down the middle, but I'm getting desperate and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer and take $400,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing in the end."
