"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to get me to accept a 60-40 split again, but this time with the numbers reversed.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split. Can you offer something more generous?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a decent share. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 32-68 split, with me getting $320,000 and Bob getting $680,000."
