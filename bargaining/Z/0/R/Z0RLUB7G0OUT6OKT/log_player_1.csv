"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm starting with a very uneven split. This is to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to be cooperative or if he's going to play aggressively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much better for me than my first proposal. However, since it's my turn to make the next offer and the money is worth the same for me, I'm going to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my initial offer, but still leave some room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise since he rejected my first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly generous, and since the money I gain is still unaffected by inflation, it makes sense to accept this offer."
