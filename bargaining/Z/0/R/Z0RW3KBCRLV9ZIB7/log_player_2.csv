"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  60/40 seems fair to start. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I think 65/35 is a fairer split, considering the inflation we need to account for. What do you think?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was too greedy. Let's meet in the middle - this benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is making it harder to secure a better deal.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible way to ensure I get a significant share of the money."
