"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm sending a friendly message to Bob to let him know it's his turn to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small share, I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, the money is worth less now. I'm not sure if I want to take a small share, but I'll consider the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was for 80% to him and 20% to me, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Considering the inflation rates, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""You took 80% last round, now it's my turn to try to balance it out. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll! The money is worth less and less with each round.

Considering the new offer, I'm not thrilled with the 15% for me, but I'll think it's better than getting nothing. I'll accept the offer to avoid further losses.
