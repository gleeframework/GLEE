"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%. I'm being generous, but I'm also aware that the money will be worth 5% less for me in the next round, so I'm trying to get a good chunk of it now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both get a good amount and avoid the risk of losing it all. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less for me now, so I need to be careful. Bob's offer of splitting it evenly seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject his offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to split it evenly, I'll try to take a bigger share this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a larger portion.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You'll get a smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  I'm willing to give you more than before, but I need to ensure I get a fair share too.  We're running out of time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger toll on my potential earnings, I need to think carefully about this offer. Bob is offering a larger share to me, but it's still not as much as I was hoping for. Considering the time pressure and the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
