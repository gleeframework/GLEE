Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see you're not budging on the 60/40 split. Let's try 57/43. I'll take the slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement before the inflation hurts us both too much. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700
