Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 4000. Let's split it 55/45 this time. It's a fairer deal considering inflation is hitting you harder. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
