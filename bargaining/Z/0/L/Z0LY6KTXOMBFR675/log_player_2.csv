"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The 60/40 split isn't quite fair in my opinion, and I think we can do better. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation for both of us. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Alice, I'll try to balance it out. Let's see what Alice thinks!

""alice_gain"": 4500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think 55/45 is still a good compromise considering the inflation.  Let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIt seems like Alice is sticking to a similar split, but I need to consider the increased impact of inflation on my end. With the money being worth 36% less for me now, I need to think carefully about my next move.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the further decrease in value for both of us. Since the money is now worth 36% less for me and 9.75% less for Alice, I'll aim for a more favorable split to compensate for my losses.
