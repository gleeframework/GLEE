"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, offering to split the $100 evenly between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but it's still a fair offer! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I need to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate my potential gain in the next round if I reject this offer. If I reject, I'll have $100 * 0.95 = $95 left, and Bob will have $100 * 0.8 = $80. In the next round, the money will be worth 5% less, so I'll have $95 * 0.95 = $90.05 and Bob will have $80 * 0.8 = $64.

Considering this, I think I should accept Bob's offer. I'll get $60 now, which is more than I would get in the next round if I reject this offer.
