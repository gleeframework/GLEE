Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should consider accepting, the inflation is really hurting your share 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that inflation is hurting my potential gains, but she's using that to her advantage and offering increasingly worse deals. I need to hold firm and hope she starts offering more reasonable amounts as the rounds progress.  We're getting into dangerous territory, but accepting a deal this low sets a bad precedent for the rest of the game."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be realistic. You know I'm losing money every round. This offer gives you a good deal, but also acknowledges the time pressure.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out and inflation is killing your share, be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. With each round, the value of my potential gain plummets due to the 20% inflation. While Alice's offer is far from ideal, rejecting it risks even worse offers in the following rounds. 

Let's analyze:

* **Current offer:** $35 (which is actually worth much less due to inflation).
* **Potential future offers:** Likely to be even lower as Alice knows time pressure is working against me.
* **Risk of getting $0:**  Very real if we don't reach an agreement in the next few rounds.

Taking a pragmatic approach, accepting this offer guarantees some return, even if significantly diminished. Rejecting it at this stage is a gamble with potentially catastrophic consequences."
