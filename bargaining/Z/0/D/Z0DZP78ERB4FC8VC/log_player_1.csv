"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering I'm taking the risk of you rejecting my offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Bob thinks I'm taking the risk, but I think he's the one taking the risk by making a proposal!

I'll reject this offer. My gain of 4000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'm actually getting less than I proposed initially. I'm hoping to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 81% of its original value (90% * 90% = 81%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""You said 60/40 is fair, but I think I deserve a bit more now.""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to 72% of the total, while keeping Bob's share at 28%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go back to a 70/30 split.  Let's end this before we both lose out more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll! My gain of 3000 is worth 27.1% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant drop.

Considering the offer, I think 70/30 is still a bit too skewed in Bob's favor, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further losses due to inflation. I'm not sure what Bob's gain is worth in terms of the original value, but I'm hoping it's not too much more than mine.
