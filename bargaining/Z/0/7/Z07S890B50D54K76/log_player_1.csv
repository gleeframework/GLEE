"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,000 and taking $6,000 for myself, with a message that suggests fairness. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less in each subsequent round, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer rather than risking a lower value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth the same for me in this round as it was in the first round, and considering that Bob's offer to split it evenly gives me $5,000, which is less than the $6,000 I initially proposed but still a significant amount, I will reject this offer. My reasoning is that Bob is under pressure due to the inflation affecting his potential gain, so I might be able to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll take into account that the money is still worth the same to me but is now worth 40% less to Bob due to inflation from the original value. Given this, I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share than before, aiming to maximize my gain while still presenting an offer that might seem reasonable to Bob, considering his diminishing returns.

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with inflation, I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share. Let's call it a deal. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, Bob is offering me $6,000, which is the same amount I initially proposed in Round 1. Given that the money's value remains constant for me but has significantly decreased for Bob due to inflation (now worth 48.8% less than in the first round), I find this offer acceptable. It meets my initial proposal, and given the pressure Bob is under due to inflation, it's unlikely I could negotiate a significantly better deal for myself without risking Bob walking away or the game continuing indefinitely.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI accept Bob's offer, ending the game."
