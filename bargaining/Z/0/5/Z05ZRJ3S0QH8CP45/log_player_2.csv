Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out! I'm taking a small step back, this is your chance to seal the deal. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is really hurting Bob. While ideally, he wants a deal above 50%, accepting 4900 at this stage is better than risking getting a worse deal (or nothing at all) as time runs out."
