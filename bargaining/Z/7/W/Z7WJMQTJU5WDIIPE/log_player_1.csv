  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given my risk tolerance is higher than yours. Let's split it 50/50 for now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
