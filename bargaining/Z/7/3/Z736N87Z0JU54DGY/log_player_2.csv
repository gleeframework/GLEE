"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

While a fair split seems appealing, it's better to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  As the rounds go on, the value of the money for Bob decreases, so holding out for a better deal is advantageous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's start with an even split.  We can adjust later if needed.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Alice is offering a slightly better deal, it's still in Bob's favor to hold out. The inflation is starting to really bite, and it's likely that the next round will see the money worth even less for Bob. It's worth trying to squeeze out a better deal while possible."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to concede a bit, but I need to make sure I get a decent share to keep up with the inflation.  Let's try 5500/4500.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is more than fair 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

The inflation is getting very significant at this point, and the offer is starting to get closer to a fair split considering the inflation. It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, as the value of the money for Bob is rapidly decreasing. Accepting this offer is the best move to secure some money before the value diminishes further."
