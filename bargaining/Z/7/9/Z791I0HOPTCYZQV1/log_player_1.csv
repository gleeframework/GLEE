"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair, since we both get a significant amount.  Let's make a deal and avoid further inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $3600.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer, as I'd like to get a larger share of the remaining money. I'll reject his offer and proceed to Round 3.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so the total amount is $9,000.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm still hoping for a good deal!""
}
```"
