"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nMy offer is to take $600,000 for myself and give Bob $400,000. I've attached a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation difference. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I think I can still get a better deal. The fact that the money is worth 20% less to me means I need to try to get a larger share to make up for it. I'll try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is eating into my share, need a bigger cut""}\n\nI've increased my proposed share to $700,000, hoping that Bob will accept it, considering that the money is worth even less to me now due to the inflation. My message tries to convey the urgency of the situation and justify my request for a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I need to make sure I get a good return as well. Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite his willingness to compromise, the share he's offering me is still not enough to make up for the significant loss in value due to inflation. At this point, the money is worth almost 50% less to me than it was initially, so I need to push for an even larger share to come out with a reasonable amount. I'll try to negotiate again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Inflation is crippling my share, this is my final compromise""}\n\nI've increased my proposed share to $800,000, which is a significant portion of the total amount. Considering the drastic effect of inflation on my share, I feel this is a necessary move. My message conveys that this is my final attempt at compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it rather than risking another round."
