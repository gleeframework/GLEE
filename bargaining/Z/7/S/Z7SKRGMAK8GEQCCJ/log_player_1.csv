"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, so I'll reject it and proceed to the next round, where I'll make a new proposal. The inflation affects both of us, but it affects Bob more, so I'm hoping to use this to my advantage in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to both of us, but more so to Bob. I'll offer Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still try to come out on top myself. Here's my proposal: {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you""}\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
