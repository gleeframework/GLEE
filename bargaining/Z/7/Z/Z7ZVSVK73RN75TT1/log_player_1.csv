  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to:

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to:

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll decide to:

```
{
