"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 100,000 and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's offer is too low, and I think I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 40% for me is a good starting point.""}\n\nI've made a counteroffer that I think is more reasonable, considering the initial amount and the fact that the money's value decreases with each round. I'm hoping Alice will see it as a good compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 65/35. It's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer as well. Considering the inflation, Alice's offer doesn't seem like a good deal for me yet. I think I can still negotiate for a better split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 45% for me is a reasonable ask. Let's settle this before the money loses more value.""}\n\nI've made another offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money. I'm hoping Alice will see that it's in both our interests to come to an agreement soon."
