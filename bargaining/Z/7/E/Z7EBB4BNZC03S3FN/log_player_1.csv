I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob is willing to accept it.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's better than nothing, I think I can still get a better deal.  I'll be the one making the offer in the next round, and I'll try to take advantage of the inflation affecting Bob's gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try to be more aggressive in this round.  I'm going to offer Bob a smaller share, but it's still better than what he offered me in the last round.  With the inflation affecting his gains, I think I can push for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, the inflation is really starting to affect Bob's gains.  I'm not sure I can get a much better deal in the next few rounds, so I'm taking what I can get."
