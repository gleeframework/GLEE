"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  We can negotiate later, but this is a good starting point.

# Alice gain: 60

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation. We can still work towards a more equitable split in the future if you want.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to split the money evenly, given the inflation and the fact that we're both losing value on our potential gains.  This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
