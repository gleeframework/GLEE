Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle. Let's split the money 50/50. It's the most fair option, and it avoids further risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 50
