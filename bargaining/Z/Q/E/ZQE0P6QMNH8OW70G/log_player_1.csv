"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to get a quick agreement and avoid further rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging from this offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to consider the value of my gain in the current round. With the 40% gain, I'd be getting $40, which is equivalent to $50 in the first round.

Considering the inflation and the fact that I'm not sure how much Bob's gain is affected, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance, but still willing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money continues to erode."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take it before things get worse! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings now.

Considering the value of the money has decreased by 48.8% since the first round, my gain of $30 in this round is equivalent to $59.15 in the first round. That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

However, I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, the value of the money will continue to erode, and I might end up with even less. Given the pressure of the time constraint (only 8 rounds left), I'll decide to accept this offer.
