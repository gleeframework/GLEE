"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and keep $600,000. What do you say?""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but it's still a relatively fair split, considering I'm the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $300,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's effectively $285,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a share that's worth $285,000, especially since I know the money is worth 5% less with each round. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 95% of its original value again, so my share is worth $950,000 (95% of $1,000,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you $450,000 and keep $550,000. Let's end the game here.""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but it's still a relatively fair split, considering the value of the money has decreased due to inflation."
