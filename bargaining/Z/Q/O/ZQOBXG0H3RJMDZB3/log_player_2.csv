"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice in each subsequent round, I have some leverage to negotiate a better deal for myself. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it closer to 55/45, considering inflation is affecting me more. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}
I'll reject this offer because I believe I can negotiate an even better deal, given the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's gains. With each passing round, Alice is more incentivized to reach an agreement, so I'll try to leverage this to my advantage. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, Alice. I think this is a reasonable adjustment.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand inflation is hitting me hard. But I'm still willing to negotiate. Let's split it at 40/60, with me taking 4000. It's the best I can do at this point. 
# Bob gain: 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer in Round 5. Given the significant impact of inflation on Alice's gains, her offer of a 40/60 split seems reasonable. At this point, she's taking a significant hit from inflation, and I don't think I can push for a much better deal without risking the negotiations breaking down. With this offer, I'll be gaining $6000, which is a good outcome considering the back-and-forth we've had. It's time to finalize the agreement and move forward!"
