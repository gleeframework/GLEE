"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I'll have to consider the relative value of the gains. In this round, Bob's gain is actually worth more than mine, relatively speaking.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. I'll give him a smaller share, but still a significant one.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of Bob's gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and he's trying to take advantage of it. However, his offer is still quite generous, and I think I should consider it.
