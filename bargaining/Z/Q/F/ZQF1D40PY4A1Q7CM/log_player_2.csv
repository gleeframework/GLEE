"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's worth rejecting this offer. While it's a decent amount, I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the next round's inflation will affect your share more than mine.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the next inflation, this is the best I can offer 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The inflation is going to significantly hurt Alice's share in the next round, and I'm likely to get a worse deal if we keep going."
