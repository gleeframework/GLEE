Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean Bob gets a significantly larger share.  It's still early in the game. I need to show firmness and try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise. This is the same split you offered, but now it benefits you even more due to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems stuck on this split.  By offering him the same numbers, he gets a slightly better deal relative to the initial value thanks to inflation working against me. This might be enough to get him to agree, and it avoids a worse outcome as time runs out."
