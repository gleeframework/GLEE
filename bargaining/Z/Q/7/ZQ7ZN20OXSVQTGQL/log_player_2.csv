Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hit is significant for me.  This offer still gives you a decent share considering it's decreasing in value less rapidly for you. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
