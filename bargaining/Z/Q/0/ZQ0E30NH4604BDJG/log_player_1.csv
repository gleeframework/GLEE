"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 700,000 dollars and leave 300,000 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm now considering the offer from Bob.

Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll calculate my actual gain as 600,000 * 0.8 = 480,000 dollars.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
