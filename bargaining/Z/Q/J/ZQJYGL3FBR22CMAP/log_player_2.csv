"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This is a classic game theory problem. In this case, the best strategy is to accept the offer in the first round. 

Here's why:

* **No information about Alice:**  You have no information about Alice's strategy or how inflation impacts her. There's no reason to believe she'll be more generous in later rounds.
* **Inflation risk:**  The risk of inflation is high. Each round reduces the value of the money significantly.
* **Fair offer:** The offer is a perfectly fair 50/50 split.

While you could try to negotiate for more, there's a real chance Alice will reject any counter-offer, leading to a cycle of rejections until the money dwindles to nothing."
