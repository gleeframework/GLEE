Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is tough, Bob. But I'm not giving up all the gains. Let's compromise with a 55/45 split. This way, we both get a decent share and move on. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
