"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, my proposed gain of $60 in the first round is now equivalent to $54 in the second round. 

Bob's offer is $20 for me and $80 for him. Since $20 is less than $54, I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the second round, which means I'm effectively getting 10% of 90% of my original gain, making it 9% of my original gain.

Since my original gain was $60, my effective gain in the third round would be 0.9 * 0.9 * 60 = 51.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49
}
```"
