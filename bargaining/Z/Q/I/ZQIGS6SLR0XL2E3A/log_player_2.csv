Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate and the inflation is heavily impacting her potential gains. While her offer is slightly better, I believe I can push for a more favorable outcome in the next couple of rounds."

{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I'm offering you a good deal considering the inflation. Let's settle this now and both get a decent share.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I need to be careful not to push her too far. This offer is a slight concession on my part, showing a willingness to compromise while still securing a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I still believe my share should be slightly higher. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Alice is clearly feeling the heat of inflation, and her offer is getting tempting. However, she's still aiming for a larger share than mine.  Given that we're past the halfway point and she's likely to get increasingly desperate, I think I can push for a slightly better outcome in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5300,
""alice_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  Take this offer before inflation eats up even more of your share. It's a fair deal!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out for Alice, and she needs to realize that her negotiating position is rapidly weakening. This offer is a slight increase for me, sending a clear signal that I'm willing to play hardball.  The strong message might be enough to convince her to accept before it's too late."
