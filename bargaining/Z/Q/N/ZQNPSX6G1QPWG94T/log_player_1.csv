"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a more balanced split is fairer. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too skewed towards you. I'd like to try to get a better deal.""
}
```

I'm not happy with the 45-55 split, and I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking on the risk of negotiation.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but I'm still willing to compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
