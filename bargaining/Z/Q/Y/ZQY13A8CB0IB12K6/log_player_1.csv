Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep 6000$ for myself and give 4000$ to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a larger share but still leaves Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
