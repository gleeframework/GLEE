Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly less favorable than my initial proposal, accepting it ensures I receive something. The inflation factor means holding out for a better deal might result in a lower payout."
