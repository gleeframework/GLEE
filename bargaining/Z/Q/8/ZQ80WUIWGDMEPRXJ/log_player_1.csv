I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure I should get the lion's share since I'm the one taking the initiative!  ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer.  He's being greedy! I'll take my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

This time, I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's fair, and it's the best way to ensure we both get a decent share before inflation eats away too much of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'm not thrilled with getting only 4000, the inflation is starting to bite, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
