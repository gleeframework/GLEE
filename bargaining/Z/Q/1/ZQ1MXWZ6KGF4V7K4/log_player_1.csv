"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation in mind, I'm considering the proposal from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm proposing a slight adjustment to the previous round's offer, with me getting a bit more and Bob getting a bit less."
