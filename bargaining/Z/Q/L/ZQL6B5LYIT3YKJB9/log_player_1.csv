"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we split the money fairly."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 80% of the original amount, which is $32.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it's still a 60/40 split in favor of Bob. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.
