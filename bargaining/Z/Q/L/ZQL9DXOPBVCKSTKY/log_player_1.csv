"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it and we can both get a good amount of money.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being quite greedy! I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a more equal split this time.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in ending this quickly before the inflation hits us too hard."
