Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by being generous and offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept.  I figure he'll get a better deal in the next round anyway, so there's no need to be too aggressive right now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. Although I'm getting a much smaller share, the inflation means that if I reject and try to make a counter-offer, the money will be worth even less to me in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now."
