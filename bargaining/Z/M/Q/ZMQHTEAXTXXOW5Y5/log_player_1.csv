Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the faster depreciation of value for you.  Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
