"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and leave Bob with $1,000.  This is a pretty generous offer, considering I get the lion's share.  I figure it's a good starting point and I hope Bob will be happy to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair split.  I'm happy to accept and move on."
