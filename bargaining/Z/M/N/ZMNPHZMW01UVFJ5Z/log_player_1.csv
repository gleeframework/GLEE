"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of 50 is actually worth 45 in real value. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll accept this offer to avoid further rounds and get a slightly better deal in real value.
