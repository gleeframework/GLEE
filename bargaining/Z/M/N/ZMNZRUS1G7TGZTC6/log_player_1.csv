"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose taking $90 for myself and giving Bob $10.  I figure this is a good starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation if he wants to push for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. I still have 10 rounds to negotiate, and the value of the money is decreasing with each passing round. I believe I can get a better deal if I continue to play."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm proposing we split the money 80/20 in my favor. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm willing to give him a bit more, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the pie. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While Bob's offer is significantly better than the last round, I'm still not satisfied.  We are at a point where the money is losing value quickly. I'm willing to take a risk and continue negotiating. I believe there is a better outcome for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor.  We're losing a lot of value with each round, so I need to start getting serious about securing a deal. This offer gives Bob a larger share than the previous rounds and hopefully will incentivize him to accept before we lose even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, I'm still not satisfied. We are rapidly approaching the point where the money will be practically worthless. I need to hold out for a better deal. I believe that by continuing to negotiate, we can reach an agreement where both of us get a more substantial share of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. We're now in the 7th round, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. I believe this offer is a fair compromise that gives Bob a reasonable share while still securing a significant portion for myself.  I'm hoping this will finally be the offer that convinces Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, I'm still not satisfied. We are quickly running out of rounds, and the value of the money is dwindling. I'm hoping that by continuing to play, I can secure a better deal that will leave me with a more substantial portion of the remaining value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're in a very precarious position now. The money is losing value at an alarming rate. To avoid getting nothing at all, I propose we split the remaining money evenly. This way, we both walk away with something, even if it's less than ideal."
