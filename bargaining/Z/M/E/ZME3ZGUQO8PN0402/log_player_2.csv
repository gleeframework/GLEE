"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent chunk, and we can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 30/70 split is better than nothing, it's worth seeing if I can get a better deal by rejecting and making a counter-offer.  The inflation factor means there's incentive to get a deal quickly, but also to try and maximize my share before it's worth less."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I appreciate the fair start, but I think we can find a better split for both of us.  Let's try 45/55, and see if we can agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is tempting, I believe I can do better than 40/60. Even with the inflation factor, it's worth seeing if I can secure a deal closer to 50/50."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go up to 48/52.  I think this is a fair split considering the inflation we're both facing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I think 58/42 is a more reasonable split for me. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While 58/42 is not my ideal split, the inflation is hitting hard, and Alice is clearly holding firm. It's time to accept before the value of my share drops even further."
