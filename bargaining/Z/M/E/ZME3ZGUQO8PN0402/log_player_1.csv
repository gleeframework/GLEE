"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent chunk, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and Bob gets 30%, which is $30. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fair start, but I think we can find a better split for both of us.  Let's try 45/55, and see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $55 is now worth 90% of the original amount, which is $49.50, and Bob's gain of $45 is worth 95% of the original amount, which is $42.75.

I'm not sure I like this offer. I was hoping to get a bit more, considering the initial offer I made was already a fair one. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 45/55 is the best split for me. I'll make a counteroffer.""
