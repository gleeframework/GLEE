"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Alice. This is a fair offer considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 250,000 is a decent amount, I can likely get more by rejecting this offer and negotiating in the next round. The value of the money will decrease for me with each round, but so will Alice's bargaining power."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
