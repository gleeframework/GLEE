Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money evenly, but since you took a larger share last round, I'm offering you a slightly smaller share this time. Let's be reasonable and get this done.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation.
