Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both lose if this drags on. This is my final offer. It's the best you'll get considering the rapid inflation. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The inflation is severe. Every round sees a significant drop in the actual value of the money. Delaying further will likely result in even less favorable offers. 
* **Bob's Position Weakening:**  While Bob's offer isn't generous, the inflation impacts him more severely. His willingness to compromise, even slightly, suggests he's feeling the pressure. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in Round 5 is very risky. Bob might become even more desperate, offering even less. It's better to secure a reasonable sum now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome."
