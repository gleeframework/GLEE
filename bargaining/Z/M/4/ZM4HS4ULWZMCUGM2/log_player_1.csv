Let's see if Bob is generous.  I'm going to try a 90/10 split in my favor. After all, the first round is crucial, and I want to establish myself as the dominant player."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is being greedy. He wants to take 90% of the money! I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round.  Remember, the money is losing value with each round, so it's in his best interest to reach an agreement soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to 60/40. Bob rejected my previous offer, so I need to show him that I'm serious about getting a good deal. However, I'm still aiming for a majority share.  Let's see if he's more reasonable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is still being stubborn! He's offering 60% for himself, and although the inflation has been hitting him harder than me, I'm still not going to give in to his greed. I'm going to keep rejecting these unreasonable offers and hope that he'll eventually come around."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This round I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. Inflation is starting to bite hard, and I think Bob is starting to realize that he's going to lose a lot of money if we don't reach an agreement soon. Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to split the money evenly."
