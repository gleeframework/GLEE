"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer. I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially since I'm already losing value due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of me, but I'm not going down without a fight!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a bit more in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to find a compromise. However, I'm not convinced that a 55/45 split is fair, especially considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer. I'm not willing to accept a split that's still heavily skewed in his favor. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer that's even more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're not meeting me in the middle, so I'll meet you in the middle of my terms!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fine, let's try again, but this time for real! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to go back to the original 50/50 split. Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $500,000 / (1 - 0.6723) = $1,490,919
* Bob's gain: $500,000 / (1 - 0.6723) = $1,490,919

This is actually a very fair split, and I think it's a good opportunity to end the game.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer."
