"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair starting point. I hope we can reach an agreement quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a very lopsided offer, and while I'm hoping for a quick agreement, I can't accept this.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a much fairer split. Let's find a way to agree on this so we both get something before the value of the money drops too much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fairer split than your last offer. Let's compromise before we both lose too much money. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, with the inflation factor in play, accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get a significant share of the money."
