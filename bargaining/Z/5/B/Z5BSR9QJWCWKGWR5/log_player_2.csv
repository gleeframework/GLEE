"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money evenly. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Understand the proposal
Alice proposes to split the $10,000 evenly between us.

## Step 2: Evaluate the gain
If I accept, I will gain $5,000 and Alice will also gain $5,000.

## Step 3: Consider the alternatives
Since this is the first round, I don't have any previous offers to compare with, but I need to consider if I can get a better deal in the next round.

## Step 4: Make a decision
Given that the offer is to split the money evenly, which seems fair and the maximum I can logically expect without further negotiation, I should accept this offer. There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in subsequent rounds.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
