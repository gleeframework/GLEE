"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less and we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a strong opening, let's see if you'll take it 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully... I'm not sure I want to give up 75% of the remaining money in just the second round. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to reduce my potential gain, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up too much, you should meet me in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, no more negotiating 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a 50/50 split. Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but I don't want to give up any more ground either.

I'll think carefully... Ah, I'll take it.
