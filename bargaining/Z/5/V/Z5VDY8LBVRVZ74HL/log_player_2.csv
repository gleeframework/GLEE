Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 57

It's painful, but I need to accept.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of my potential gain is decreasing rapidly with each round due to the 20% inflation.  Waiting any longer will only hurt me more.
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:** Alice has consistently offered me worse deals, knowing the inflation is working in her favor. She's unlikely to offer anything better at this point. 

While 43 is much lower than I'd like, it's better than getting even less in a future round.
