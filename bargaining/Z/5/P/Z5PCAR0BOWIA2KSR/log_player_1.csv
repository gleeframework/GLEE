"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you value a quick resolution, Alice. How about this: I take 70% and you take 30%. It's still a good deal for you considering inflation will take a bigger bite out of your share with each round. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
