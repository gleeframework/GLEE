I propose we split the money 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I propose we split the money 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a tough one, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. Even with inflation, 450,000 is still a significant amount of money. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 50/50 split.  We're both losing value with each round, and I think this is the fairest way to go forward."
