"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40 and take 60. Accept?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount and the game can proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to split it 50/50, I want a slightly better deal considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 10% less than in the second round, so I need to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30, but I need a bit more to make up for the inflation. Accept?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Considering the significant drop in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be cautious.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
