Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, but not quite there 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Time is running out, but Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. I need to hold out for a better deal. Accepting anything less than 45 at this point would be a loss compared to what I could have had in Round 1."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one, but I need to cut my losses. Accepting 44 now is better than risking getting even less or nothing at all as the rounds progress. Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point."
