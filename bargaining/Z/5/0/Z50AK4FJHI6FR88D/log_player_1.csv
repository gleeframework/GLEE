Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the rapid devaluation for you, this is a fairer deal than the initial offer. It benefits both of us to settle now rather than lose more value in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
