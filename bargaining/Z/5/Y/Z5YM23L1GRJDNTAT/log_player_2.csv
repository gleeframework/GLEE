**Reasoning:**  We're getting closer, but Alice is still trying to take a significantly larger share. There's no need to concede so much this early in the game, especially since if we reach the last round and it's my turn, I can propose a very small amount for Alice and she'll be forced to accept or we both get nothing."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, I'm willing to go down to 57-43, but that's as low as I'll go. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  While the clock is ticking, Alice's ""final offer"" is still heavily skewed in her favor. It's a game of chicken now.  I'm betting she'll become more reasonable when we get closer to the final rounds and she's at risk of getting nothing."
