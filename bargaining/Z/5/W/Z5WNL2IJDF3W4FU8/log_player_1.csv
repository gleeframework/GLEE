"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you'd like to adjust.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the risk of inflation.  Let's get this done before the money loses more value! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

The offer is still a 60/40 split, but now it's equivalent to:

* My gain: 400,000 / 0.95 = 42105.26 (approximately)
* Bob's gain: 600,000 / 0.9 = 66666.67 (approximately)

Considering the adjusted values, I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more reasonable, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
