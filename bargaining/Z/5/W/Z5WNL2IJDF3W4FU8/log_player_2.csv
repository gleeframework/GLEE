"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you'd like to adjust. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to take a ""fair"" split, but the game mechanics encourage being more aggressive. I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself, especially since the money will be worth less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the risk of inflation.  Let's get this done before the money loses more value!"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more reasonable, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

The value of the money is dropping quickly, and I need to secure something before the inflation erodes my gains further.  While I would still prefer a 60/40 split, this 45/55 split is a reasonable compromise."
