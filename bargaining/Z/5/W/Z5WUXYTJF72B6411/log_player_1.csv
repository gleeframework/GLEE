"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to negotiate too much 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to meet in the middle! That's a reasonable offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept his offer of $5,000 for me and $5,000 for him. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the game quickly now."
