"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer. This gives me the majority of the money, but still allows Bob to get something. I think this is a good starting point to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to get more, it's better to take a fair offer now than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
