Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a slightly unfair deal in the first round.  I'll take a large portion to start, but I'm ready to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, 20% is better than nothing, especially since the money is losing value with each round. It's a gamble, but I'll take the guaranteed 20%."
