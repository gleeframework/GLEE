Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a better deal than the last round. It's clear the inflation is heavily impacting you, let's end this now and both get something. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The inflation rate is severely impacting Bob.  His potential gains are diminishing with each passing round. Accepting $4,800 now is better than risking even less in future rounds.
* **Alice is Unlikely to Budge:**  Alice has consistently offered Bob a smaller portion and is unlikely to change her strategy. She knows time is on her side.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Holding out for a better offer in future rounds is extremely risky. There's a chance Bob could end up with a significantly smaller amount, or even nothing if they can't reach an agreement. 

While getting a slightly larger share in earlier rounds would have been preferable, accepting the current offer cuts Bob's losses and avoids the gamble of further inflation."
