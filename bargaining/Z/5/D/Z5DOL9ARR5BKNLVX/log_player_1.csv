"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still be generous 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the offer, I'll have to accept it since I don't want to risk losing even more value with each round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 200,000$ and call it a day. Thanks for the game, Bob!"
