**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down, but it's still early in the game. She's clearly aiming to get more than half, and while her offers are getting closer to a 50/50 split, the impact of inflation is starting to become significant.  We can likely get a better deal by continuing to push."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A perfectly even split. Let's end this before inflation eats away any more of our potential winnings.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now past the halfway point, and inflation is becoming a serious factor. While we were initially aiming for a slightly better split, a 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical offer at this point. It sends a clear message that we're serious about ending this quickly and minimizing losses due to inflation."
