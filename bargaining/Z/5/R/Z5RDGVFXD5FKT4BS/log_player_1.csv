Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 55/45 split. I propose 60/40, with me getting the larger share this time. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
