Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 60/40 split in my favor recognizing my risk in rejecting your first offer and the impact of inflation as time passes. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
