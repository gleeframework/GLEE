Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your last offer was too far off from my expectations. I'm willing to compromise, but I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is still fair considering the risks of further inflation. Let's work together and reach a solution that benefits both of us.

# Alice gain: 600000
