"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see how it goes.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split is a good starting point, but I'll take a slightly larger share this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of the original $6,000, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of the original $4,000.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer, as it's still a 50-50 split, and I'd like to negotiate further to get a slightly larger share. I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need a bit more to compensate for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share to account for the inflation, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $5,200 is now worth 52% of the original $6,000, and Bob's gain of $4,800 is worth 96% of the original $5,000.

I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation. I'm willing to accept the offer.
