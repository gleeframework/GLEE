"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering we don't know how inflation will affect us. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. I'll take a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll need to reassess the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to consider the actual value of the money.

Let's calculate the effective values:

My gain: $5000 (worth 100% of its original value)
Bob's gain: $5000 (worth 80% of its original value, due to 20% inflation)

Considering the effective values, I'd be getting $5000 and Bob would be getting $4000 (80% of $5000).

I'd rather not accept this offer, as I'd be giving up a significant amount of value due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to take a slightly larger share this time, considering the inflation effect.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I need to prioritize my own gain. Let's see if this works for you.""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values:

My gain: $4000 (worth 100% of its original value)
Bob's gain: $6000 (worth 51.2% of its original value, due to 48.8% inflation)

Considering the effective values, I'd be getting $4000 and Bob would be getting $6128 (51.2% of $6000).

I'd rather not accept this offer, as I'd be giving up a significant amount of value due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to take an even larger share this time, considering the inflation effect.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up more, Bob. I need to prioritize my own gain now. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, Alice. I'll take what I can get. This is my last offer. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values:

My gain: $7000 (worth 100% of its original value)
Bob's gain: $3000 (worth 32.77% of its original value, due to 67.23% inflation)

Considering the effective values, I'd be getting $7000 and Bob would be getting $984 (32.77% of $3000).

This is a surprisingly low offer, considering the value of the money. I'll accept this offer, as it's the best I can get at this point.
