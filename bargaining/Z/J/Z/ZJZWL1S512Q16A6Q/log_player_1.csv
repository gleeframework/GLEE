"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm starting with a 60/40 split, giving me a larger share to try to secure a good outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more aggressive to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the inflation and Bob's previous offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm giving up a bit more to Bob, but still trying to maintain a slight advantage."
