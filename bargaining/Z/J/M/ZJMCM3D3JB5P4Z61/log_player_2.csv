Alice's offer:

I'll reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation will affect us both differently. Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'm making a concession. Let's settle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I still think I could get a slightly better deal, the inflation is really starting to bite into my potential gains. It's better to take this offer and secure something than risk getting nothing at all."
