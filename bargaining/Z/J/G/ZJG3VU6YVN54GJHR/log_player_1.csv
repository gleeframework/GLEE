"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money. I'm aware of the inflation, but I'm willing to take a smaller share in the first round to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy. I won't accept that offer.  I'm hoping he'll become more reasonable in the next round, and that the inflation will start to hurt him more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still aiming for a larger portion. Inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm hoping that Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer before the value of his share drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being unreasonable. I'm not going to accept that offer, even though the inflation is biting into my potential earnings.  He's clearly still not understanding how badly inflation is impacting me. I'm hoping the next round will make him think twice."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is fair considering the significant inflation we've both experienced. I hope Bob will finally see the value of compromise before we both lose even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still not grasping the situation.  The inflation is hurting me significantly more than him. This offer is not even close to being fair. I'm going to keep fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I believe this is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.  We're both suffering from inflation, but I'm willing to concede more to reach a deal before we lose everything.  Hopefully, Bob will finally see that accepting this offer is in his best interest too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is not ideal, it's better than nothing. Bob finally seems to be understanding the severity of the inflation affecting me.  Even though my share is still significantly less than I initially wanted, I'd rather accept this offer and get something than risk getting nothing at all."
