"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\nI offered Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $600,000, which is 60%. I also sent a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to try to convince Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round, I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI rejected Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, the $400,000 I would gain in this round is worth less than it was in the first round. I believe I can make a better offer in the next round to maximize my gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I offered Bob $450,000 and I'll take $550,000. I sent a message saying ""Meet me in the middle, considering inflation"" to try to convince Bob to accept the offer, taking into account that the money is worth less for me due to inflation. I'm trying to find a compromise that would be acceptable to both of us."
