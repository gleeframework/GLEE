"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 90/10. I'll take the larger share, but you get something too.  We can always renegotiate in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 1000$ is something, it's worth considering the potential for a better deal. Inflation will make the next round's money worth less, but it also gives Bob the chance to propose a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  It accounts for the fact that we both have to share the money, and it gives us both a decent amount. Let's finish this and move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway with a 60/40 split.  This is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's gains are reduced due to inflation, the 60/40 split is a significant improvement from the initial 90/10 offer.  Accepting allows Bob to secure a substantial portion of the money and avoid further potential losses from inflation in future rounds."
