"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a warning that this is a good deal, but it's up to him to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. No need to fight over it! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than splitting it evenly. With inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth less than my initial gain of $900,000, so I'm not interested in settling for 50% of the remaining amount. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less after the first round and another 5% less after the second round, it's now worth 90% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob! I'll take this deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $280,000 and keeping $720,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a jab at Bob for being too generous in his previous offer."
