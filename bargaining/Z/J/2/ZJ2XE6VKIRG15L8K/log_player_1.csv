Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each passing round. Let's be reasonable and split it 40/60. I'll take 40, and you get the rest. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to get concerned about the impact of inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement soon. Bob's offer of 40/60 is not ideal, but it's a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer and take the 60% share, which is $60."
