I'm going to be greedy and try to take nearly everything. If Bob rejects, I'll have to adjust my offer in the next round, but I'm hoping the prospect of getting anything is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep more of the money, it's a significant improvement over the previous round.  The inflation is working against me, and I want to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
