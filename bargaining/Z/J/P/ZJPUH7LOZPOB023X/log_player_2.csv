"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. Time is money! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible starting offer! While I lose value faster than Alice, that disparity is not large enough to justify such an uneven split. I'm hoping she'll come to her senses in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. This time is MY money. I'm proposing a more reasonable split considering the devaluation rate.""
}
``` 

This offer is still generous to Alice considering the faster devaluation of her share. By taking a strong stance, I'm hoping to establish a more favorable negotiating position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't get greedy, Bob. This offer is fair considering the devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I'll accept. 

Alice is clearly playing hardball, and while the split isn't ideal, it's better than risking further devaluation. Accepting now guarantees me a decent sum, even with the inflation factored in. Holding out might backfire, especially if Alice is willing to play chicken with the shrinking pot."
