"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 100,000$ is a good starting point, it's likely Alice will offer a better deal in the next round if I reject. I want to see if I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is worse than my previous offer, even with the inflation factor.  I need to keep pushing for a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm increasing my share again, hoping to find a middle ground that Alice will accept. While I realize the inflation is working against me, I believe a larger share is still possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting worse with each round, even with the inflation effect on her share.  I need to keep trying for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000} 
```

I'm raising my offer again, hoping that Alice will start to see the value in accepting a deal before things get even worse for her due to inflation. I'm willing to give her a bit more, but not much more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd love to push for a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt.  Alice's offer is pretty fair, and it's risky to keep rejecting offers.  Accepting this offer ensures that I will receive something, and it's more than I initially expected."
