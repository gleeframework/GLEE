"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer in my favor.  Since the money is worth less to Bob each round, I want to secure as much of the money as possible in the early rounds.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer deal for me than the previous offer, and since the money is worth less to Bob each round, I'm likely to get a worse offer if I reject."
