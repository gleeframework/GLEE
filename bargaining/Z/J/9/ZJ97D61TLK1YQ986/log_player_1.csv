"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. This is a reasonable starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. The message ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%"" is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept, implying that 60% is a generous offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn!  How about a slightly better deal for me this time? Think carefully, the clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 5% less to me now, I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split in Bob's favor. I'll take my chances and make another offer in the next round, hoping to get a better deal. The pressure is on, but I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll offer a 57-43 split in my favor. Considering the 5% decrease in value for me, this offer is closer to the original 60-40 split I proposed. I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept, while still being mindful of the inflation's impact on my share. The message ""Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation"" aims to convey a sense of compromise and awareness of the changing circumstances. Will Bob accept this offer?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The pot is shrinking Alice! This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for me due to inflation (14.26% less than the original amount), I'll accept Bob's offer. Although it's not the best deal for me, the risk of further inflation and potentially worse offers in future rounds makes this option more appealing. Bob's message implies that this is his final offer, and I don't want to risk losing even more value. I'll take the 47.5-52.5 split and end the game here. It's not ideal, but it's better than taking a chance on further losses."
