Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to see how Bob responds.  We'll adjust our strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me, and it's likely that Bob won't be able to get a better deal in the next round due to the inflation. It's better to secure half the money now than risk getting nothing in the end."
