"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, see what happens next!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share this round, but I'll make it up to you later 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll accept Bob's offer since I'll be getting a fixed amount of $2000, which is worth the same as in the previous round, and I'm willing to take a smaller share this round to see if Bob will make good on his promise to make it up to me later.
