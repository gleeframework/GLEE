"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money almost equally, with a slight advantage for me to start. This way we both benefit from finishing the game quickly. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. With the 5% inflation, I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for you in each round, I think we should adjust the split accordingly. This way, we both benefit from finishing the game quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to settle this quickly. Let's just split it evenly and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me and 19% less for Alice compared to the first round, an even split seems reasonable. Further rounds would only decrease the value of the money, so it's time to settle."
