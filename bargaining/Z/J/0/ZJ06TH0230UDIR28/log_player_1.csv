"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI offered a 60-40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. I included a message ""Let's be fair"" to convey that I think this is a reasonable and fair offer. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer because, although he says it's the fairest way, I think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I want to try to get more than half of the original amount. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nI offered a 58-42 split, with me getting $5800 and Bob getting $4200. I included a message ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers"" to convey that I'm trying to compromise between our previous proposals. I took into account the inflation, so the actual value of the money is lower, but I'm still trying to get a bit more than half of the original amount. Your turn!"
