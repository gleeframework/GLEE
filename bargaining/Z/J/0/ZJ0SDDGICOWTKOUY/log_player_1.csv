"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob. This should encourage him to accept and finish the game early, maximizing our gains before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, and since the money is worth less now, it makes sense to try and negotiate a better deal by rejecting and forcing him to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering Bob 20 dollars, which is still less than my initial offer but more than what he offered me in round 2.  I'm hoping this will convince him to accept, given the fact that the money is worth less each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my initial offer, and the inflation is hitting us both hard.  It's time to try and force him to make a more reasonable offer.  I'm hoping he's feeling the pressure of the diminishing returns, and will realize it's better to compromise now than risk getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still keeping it higher than what Bob is proposing. I'm hoping this will start to close the gap and nudge him closer to accepting.  The inflation is getting serious, and I need to start securing a decent portion of the money before we both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than what I offered in the previous round, and the inflation is really starting to bite.  I need to hold firm and try to get a better deal.  The longer we wait, the less both of us will get.  I'm hoping he'll realize that accepting a decent offer now is better than potentially getting nothing in the end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars.  This is still a better deal for him than his last offer, and I'm hoping the pressure of the increasingly severe inflation will push him to accept.  We're both losing a lot of value with each passing round, and it's time to start making some compromises."
