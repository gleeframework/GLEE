"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation disadvantage you'll face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, the actual amounts I would get in this round would be:

* My gain: $4,000 x 0.9 = $3,600
* Bob's gain: $6,000 (no change due to inflation)

I'm not sure I like the fact that Bob is trying to dictate the same split as the previous round, considering the changed circumstances. I'd like to propose a different split that takes into account the inflation disadvantage.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation disadvantage I'll face in the next round, I'd like to propose a more favorable split for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I should get a bit more to compensate for the decrease in value. This is a fairer split, I think.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."
