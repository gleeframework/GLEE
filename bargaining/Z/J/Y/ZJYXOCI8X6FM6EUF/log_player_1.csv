Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering inflation will affect the value of the money we get later. Let's agree on this and end the game.

# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
