"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount to start with, and I'll take the rest, $80. My message is to propose a fair split and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. Consider it a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $70 in this round is actually worth $56 in real terms (since 80% of $70 is $56).

I'll think about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $60 in this round is actually worth $48 in real terms (since 80% of $60 is $48).

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more this round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a slightly smaller share than before, and I'll take $60. My message is to convey that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle this time. Let's see if we can finally agree. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 in this round is actually worth $24.80 in real terms (since 48.8% of $50 is $24.80).

I'll think about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise. I'm willing to take the $24.80 and call it a day."
