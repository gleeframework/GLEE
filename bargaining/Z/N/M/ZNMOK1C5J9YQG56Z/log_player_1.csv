"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for being the first to propose.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiation.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less in each round, I'll try to get a better share this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy! I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still the one making the proposal.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 7000, trying to get a better deal before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you an equal share, but I think we should split it 50/50 to make it fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. However, a 50/50 split is a good opportunity to end the game quickly.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
