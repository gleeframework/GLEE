"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the deal quickly.  Since we don't know how inflation affects him, I want to be sure to get most of the money in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, Bob's offer is fair and avoids further risk of inflation.  Accepting is the best strategy at this point."
