I propose to take $900,000 for myself and leave $100,000 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, given the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm going to offer Bob $200,000, and keep $800,000 for myself. Inflation is hitting harder now, so I need to secure a bigger share to ensure I get a decent amount."
