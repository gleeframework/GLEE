"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share this time. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
