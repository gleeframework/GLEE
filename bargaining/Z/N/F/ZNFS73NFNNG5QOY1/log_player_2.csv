"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I believe this is a generous offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on your gains, this is a reasonable adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation situation to her advantage. While it's true my potential gains are diminishing, accepting a 30/70 split would be severely detrimental to my position. It's better to gamble on making one final offer myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's crucial we reach an agreement now, as further delays only hurt me.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I am offering a slight concession from my previous 50/50 offer. It's important to emphasize the urgency of the situation. Alice needs to understand that while another round might seem beneficial to her, it's likely that I'll reject any offer below this threshold.  It's getting too risky for me to continue, and this offer represents a reasonable compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the substantial impact of inflation, this is a fair adjustment. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but I have to accept. Alice is playing hardball, and my bargaining power is eroding rapidly with each passing round due to inflation. Accepting a 25/75 split is far from ideal, but if I reject this, there's a very real chance I'll end up with even less in the final round. It's clear Alice is content to drag this out, knowing time is on her side."
