"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 4:1 ratio. This might seem a bit lopsided, but consider the decreasing value of the money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. How about a 3:2 ratio? The money is still worth something, and I'm willing to give you a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{
