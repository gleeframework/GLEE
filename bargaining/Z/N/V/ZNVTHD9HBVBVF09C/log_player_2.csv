"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer sounds ""fair"" on the surface, the inflation heavily favors Bob in this scenario. It makes more sense for Bob to aim for a larger share of the money, even if it takes a few rounds of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts a time crunch on both of us, but your initial offer undervalues the rate at which my share loses value. Let's try something closer to the middle.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong starting point:** Bob's offer, while still favoring him, is less extreme than Alice's initial proposal. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while establishing a firm position. 
* **Acknowledging the time pressure:**  Mentioning the inflation reminds Alice that time is a factor for Bob too, making him appear less like he's stalling. 
* **Aiming for a compromise:**  By stating that he wants to move ""closer to the middle,"" Bob hints at potential future concessions if Alice rejects this offer.  

This approach aims to bring Alice to the negotiating table while keeping a significant portion of the potential gains for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share lost more value than yours, I'll make a slight adjustment 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to make it seem like she's making a concession, but this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the accelerated inflation she's facing.  Bob needs to hold firm and demonstrate that her attempts to frame the negotiation to her advantage aren't working."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and we both lose with every round. I'm offering a split that acknowledges the inflation disparity while still giving us both a sizable share. It's time to close this deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting to urgency:** The message now focuses on the shared risk of losing everything if they can't agree. 
* **Direct and firm:** Bob is no longer trying to be subtle. He's directly stating that Alice's offers are not ""realistic"" given the circumstances.
* **Final offer tone:**  While not explicitly a ""final offer,"" the language suggests that Bob is getting close to his bottom line. He's presented a clear, justifiable split. 

This approach combines firmness with a sense of urgency, hoping to push Alice towards a final decision."
