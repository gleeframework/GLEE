# Alice's message: Your 'fair' 50/50 is actually 60/40 in my favor due to inflation. I'll take more 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I need to cut my losses.  Alice is clearly content to let inflation eat away at my potential gains. Accepting 38 now is better than risking an even worse offer later, or even ending up with nothing if we reach the final round."
