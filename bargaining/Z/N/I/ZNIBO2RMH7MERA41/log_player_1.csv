"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60% for me and 40% for you""}\n\n###\n\nI propose that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. I've attached a message suggesting that this division is fair. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer. If he rejects it, the game will proceed to the next round, where Bob will make a proposal. Remember, with each passing round, the value of the money decreases by 10% for Bob, but remains the same for me. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation factor will kick in for me next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although Bob has taken into account the inflation factor, I believe I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth the same to me in every round, I don't have to worry about the inflation factor. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, you've lost 10% of the value in the last round and will lose another 10% in this round. I think 70% for me and 30% for you is a good compromise.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my share to $700,000 and offer Bob $300,000. My message to Bob points out that he has already lost 10% of the value in the last round and will lose another 10% in this round due to inflation. I believe this split is a good compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a 60/40 split, but I'm not going any lower than that. The inflation is hurting my gains too much. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn this round, Bob has offered a 60/40 split, which is the same split I initially proposed in Round 1. Considering the inflation factor, Bob's gain is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round. I believe this offer is reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it. By accepting this offer, I will receive $600,000, and Bob will receive $400,000, which is now worth less due to inflation. I think this is a fair deal, and I'm happy to end the game here."
