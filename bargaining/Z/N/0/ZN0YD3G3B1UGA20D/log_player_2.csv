"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 90%, you get 10%. This is a good starting point, what do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with only 10%. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away with a significant amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much for me. Let's go for 70/30. This is a fair deal considering inflation, and we can both get a decent amount. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option. Inflation is eating away at our gains, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal if we keep going."
