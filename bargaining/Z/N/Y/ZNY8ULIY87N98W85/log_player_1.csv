Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the inflation.  We both get a good amount, and it's more even than your previous proposal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
