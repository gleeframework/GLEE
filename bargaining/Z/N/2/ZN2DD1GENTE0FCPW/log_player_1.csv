"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. I'll start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000$ and Bob getting 400,000$. My message to Bob is ""Let's split it down the middle. I'll start."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 600k, you can have 400k.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me. My gain of 400,000$ is worth 10% less than the 600,000$ I initially proposed, so I'm not getting the better deal I wanted.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me again, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in Round 2. I'll have to make a new proposal that takes this into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I want a slightly better deal for myself this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting 420,000$ and Bob getting 580,000$. My message to Bob is ""I'll compromise, but I want a slightly better deal for myself this time."""
