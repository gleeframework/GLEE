"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'm not willing to accept a 80-20 split, especially since I'm already losing value due to inflation. I want a better deal to compensate for the decrease in purchasing power.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is biting, and I need to adjust my proposal accordingly!

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on a 55-45 split, let's move forward!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous split, but still trying to get a decent share considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. While it's a slight improvement from my previous offer, I'm still not getting a good enough share, considering the inflation. I'm losing value at a rate of 48.8% per round, and I need to make up for that.

I'll try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really eating into my potential gains!

Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not backing down! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a huge bite out of my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. With inflation eating away at my potential gains at a rate of 67.23%, I need to be extremely cautious and try to get as much as possible. $3,000 is not enough, considering the value of money is decreasing so rapidly.

I'll try to do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really accelerating!

Here's my new offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, no more haggling!""
}
```

I'm going for a 50-50 split, hoping to get a fair share considering the rapidly decreasing value of money. I'm trying to be realistic and accept the current situation, hoping Bob will agree to this compromise."
