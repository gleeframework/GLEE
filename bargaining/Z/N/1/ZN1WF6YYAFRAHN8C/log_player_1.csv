"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have all the fun, I need a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the 5% inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth less than $380,000 in terms of purchasing power. Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! My gain of $300,000 is now worth significantly less than before.
