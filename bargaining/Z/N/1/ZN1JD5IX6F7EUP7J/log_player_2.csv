""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about a 55/45 split? This accounts for the fact that the money will be worth less as time goes on, impacting you more than me.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to budge a little.  Let's go with a 52/48 split. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation we're both facing.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
