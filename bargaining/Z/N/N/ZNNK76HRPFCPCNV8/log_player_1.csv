"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20, and I'll take 80. You can do better or worse in the next round if you want.""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm taking the larger share. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. You can take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, my gain of 70 is equivalent to 66.5 in the first round.

Considering this offer is slightly better than my initial one, I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
