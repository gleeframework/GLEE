"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40 dollars, and I'll take 60 dollars for myself. It's a fair deal, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting! My offer from Round 1 was worth 60 dollars, but now it's only worth 57.50 dollars (60 - 2.5% = 57.50).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get 20 dollars, which is worth 19 dollars after inflation (20 - 5% = 19). It's a pretty low amount, but it's still better than nothing.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer.

Since my offer from Round 1 was worth 57.50 dollars, I'll try to increase the amount I'm asking for. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll! My offer from Round 1 was worth 60 dollars, but now it's worth 51.69 dollars (60 - 14.26% = 51.69).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get 15 dollars, which is worth 12.88 dollars after inflation (15 - 14.26% = 12.88). It's a very low amount, but it's still better than nothing.

However, I'm not sure if I want to settle for such a low amount. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings! My offer from Round 1 was worth 60 dollars, but now it's worth 51.69 dollars (as calculated in Round 4). I'll try to make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Considering Bob's previous offers, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount than my previous offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm offering a 45-55 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really getting out of control! My offer from Round 1 was worth 60 dollars, but now it's worth 46.73 dollars (60 - 22.62% = 46.73).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get 10 dollars, which is worth 7.73 dollars after inflation (10 - 22.62% = 7.73). It's an extremely low amount, and I'm starting to get worried that I'll be left with almost nothing.

However, I don't want to risk going to another round and facing even lower offers. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
