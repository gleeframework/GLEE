"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very unequal split, but I'm hoping that Bob will be tempted to take the 100,000, rather than risk getting nothing if we keep going and inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get more, it's clear Bob is aiming for a similar strategy, and the next round might see the money we gain shrink even further. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least something, and with the 10% inflation hit on my side, there's a good chance I'll be left with nothing if I keep rejecting."
