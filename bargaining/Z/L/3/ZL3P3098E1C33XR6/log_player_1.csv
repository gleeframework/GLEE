"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a clean slate. Accept this offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

This way, I get the whole $100, and Bob gets nothing. It's a bold opening move, but I'm hoping Bob will be eager to negotiate!"
