900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you can have the remaining 10%.  We can adjust in the next round if you think it's unfair.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I'll start with a 50/50 split. Let's see if we can do better than that.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Okay, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. 70/30 split seems reasonable. If you reject this, the next round will be even more disadvantageous for you, due to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'll compromise with a 60/40 split. It's a good deal for both of us, considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,I'm willing to meet you halfway. 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation. Let's end this game and avoid further losses due to inflation.,Alice,5,
