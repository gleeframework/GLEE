60.0,40.0,Let's split it 60/40. It's a fair deal for a quick agreement.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,Your split seems a bit unbalanced to me. How about we try 55/45?,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,I'm sticking with 60/40.  Time is ticking and the pot is shrinking. Let's be realistic.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,This is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it.,Bob,4,
