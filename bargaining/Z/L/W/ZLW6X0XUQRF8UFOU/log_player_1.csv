"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the first to make an offer. This gives me a good starting point while offering Bob a small amount to consider accepting. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it. It's a significant drop from my initial proposal, and I'm confident I can do better. I'll see if I can negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly to 7000/3000. This demonstrates I'm willing to compromise but still retain a significant share of the money. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair offer, considering the inflation effect and the limited time left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Despite the inflation, his offer is still not as good as my initial proposal, and I believe I can secure a better outcome with another round of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm decreasing my offer again, demonstrating flexibility, but I'm still holding out for a larger share. With inflation impacting Bob's gains more than mine, he might be more willing to accept a slightly lower offer this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly lopsided in his favor, despite the inflation. I'm going to reject it. While the time is running out, I'm still hoping to secure a more equitable split. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

The time is running out, and I need to find a middle ground. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's a significant compromise from my previous offers, but with inflation impacting Bob's gains, it might be the best we can achieve at this point."
