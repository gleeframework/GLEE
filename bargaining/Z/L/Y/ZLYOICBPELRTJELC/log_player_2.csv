**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer prevents further losses due to inflation. 

* **Time Pressure:**  We are in round 5 with no guarantee of a better offer from Alice. The longer the game goes, the less the money is worth. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** The difference between our current offer and Alice's is shrinking, and further rounds will likely result in even smaller gains.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum. Rejecting risks getting an even worse offer in later rounds, where the money is worth significantly less."
