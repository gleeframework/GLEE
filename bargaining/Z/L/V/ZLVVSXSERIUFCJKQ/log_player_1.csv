"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me, and the inflation is working against me. I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still hoping to get a good share, but I'm adjusting my offer slightly down to account for the inflation and show some willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and the inflation is hitting me hard. I need to hold out for a better deal, even though the rounds are dwindling. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm making another concession, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. Time is running out, and I need to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation is making the money I receive increasingly worthless.  I need to hold out for a better deal.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I need to find a balance between securing a fair deal and risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not appealing, and the inflation is making the money I receive increasingly worthless. I'm going to make a counter-offer in the next round.  I'm running out of time, but I'm still hoping for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm realizing that I need to compromise to avoid ending up with nothing.  A 50/50 split seems like the fairest and most likely outcome at this point."
