"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This seems like a fair starting point, don't you think, Bob? 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal doesn't seem fair to me, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. I'm hoping for a more balanced division in the subsequent rounds. Let's proceed to the next round and see if Alice is willing to adjust her proposal.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! What's your next move?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to make a more balanced proposal, taking into account the inflation that affects both of us. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I think we should aim for a more equal division to minimize the impact of inflation.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to minimize inflation losses.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! Will you accept this offer or proceed to the next round?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we meet a bit closer to the middle, Bob? It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI appreciate Alice's willingness to adjust her proposal, but I still think the division is not fair considering the significant impact of inflation on her side. Given that the money is worth 36% less for her than in the first round, I believe she should be more willing to compromise. I'll hold out for a better offer.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! What's your next move?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, especially on Alice's side, I think it's time to make a slightly more aggressive proposal. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll aim for a division that takes into account the decreasing value for both of us.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Given the high inflation on your side, I think this is a fair compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! Will you accept this offer or proceed to the next round?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a serious offer, Bob.  We both need to benefit before the inflation eats away at the value.  Let's be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, especially on Alice's side, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise. The money is worth 59.04% less for Alice than in the first round, and 18.55% less for me. Given the decreasing value, I believe this division is fair, and it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further losses in subsequent rounds.\n\n###\n\nI'm willing to accept this offer and conclude the game."
