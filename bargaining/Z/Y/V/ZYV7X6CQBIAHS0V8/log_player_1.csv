"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. I'll take 5500, and you get 4500. It's a good start, and we can still find a better deal later if you'd like. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
