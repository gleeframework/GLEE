"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for negotiation!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 exactly in half, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will see the simplicity and fairness of this offer and accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'm willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less, so I'm looking at a gain of $4,500 (5000 * 0.9) if I accept this offer. Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he's offering me $5,800 (6000 * 0.95).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a bit skewed towards Bob's gain. I'll reject it for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher proportion of the total to compensate for the reduced value. I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to balance my gain with the reduced value of the money, while also making a stronger offer to try to sway Bob towards accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for my patience! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to add up!

Let's calculate the actual values:

* My gain of $4500 is worth 72.9% of the original $5000 (100% - 27.1%), which is approximately $3630.
* Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 85.74% of the original $6000 (100% - 14.26%), which is approximately $4695.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm running out of time. I'll accept it, hoping that Bob will stick to his word and not try to take advantage of me in future rounds.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
