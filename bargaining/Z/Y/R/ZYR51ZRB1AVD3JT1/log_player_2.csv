Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can work out a better deal later if you want.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept a 90/10 split right off the bat. Let's see what kind of counter-offer I can get!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fairer starting point. We can adjust it later if needed.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle.  It's getting late and we're both losing money with each round. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and we're both losing money with each passing round.  Let's call it a day."
