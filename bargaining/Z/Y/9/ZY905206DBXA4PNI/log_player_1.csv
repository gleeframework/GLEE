Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'll be taking a bigger hit from the inflation in later rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take what I can get now before the value drops even further.  The inflation is hitting me harder, so it's wise to accept this offer."
