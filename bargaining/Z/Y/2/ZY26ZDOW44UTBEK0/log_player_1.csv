"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take $6,000, which is 60% of the original amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's make a deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4,000 in the first round. Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $3,800 in the first round.

Considering the inflation adjustment, I think Bob's offer is a good compromise. I accept his offer.
