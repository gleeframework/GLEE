"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split this time! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll consider the value of the money I'll gain and the value of the money Bob will gain.

Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll get $50. However, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so he'll get $47.50.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
