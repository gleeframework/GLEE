"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair offer, giving myself the majority but leaving Bob with a small share. I'm hoping he'll accept it, as it's better than nothing, and I'll get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option for me. If I reject, I get to propose in the next round, but inflation will eat away at the value of the money I receive. With each passing round, my share will be worth less. It's better to take the smaller share now and avoid further losses."
