Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game."

Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation in this round. However, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I'd like to get a bit more. I'll reject it.
