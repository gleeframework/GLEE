"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to share fairly, but with the inflation factor, this deal works better for both of us. I'm taking a smaller risk by offering you more now, as you'll lose a significant portion of your share in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
