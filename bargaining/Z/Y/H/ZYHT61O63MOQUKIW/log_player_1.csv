"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a 90-10 split, which seems reasonable given that I'm making the first offer. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate from there."
