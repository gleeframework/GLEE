**Reasoning:** Alice is steadily chipping away at my potential gains while using the inflation against me. While the offer is getting closer to something acceptable, I need to show her I'm willing to push this further to secure a better deal.  I'm hoping she'll start to get nervous as we burn through the rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be real, Alice. We're running out of time. This is the best offer you'll get with inflation eating my share.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  The longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation. It's time to show I'm serious by proposing an even split, despite the inflation working against me. This might be my best chance to secure a decent amount before my position weakens further."
