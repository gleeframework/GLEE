"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount to start with.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can reassess our priorities in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 from the first round is now worth $4,800.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. However, considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal.
