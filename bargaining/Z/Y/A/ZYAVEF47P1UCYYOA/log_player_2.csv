It's better to wait and see what Alice proposes in the next round, since the inflation will likely make the money worth less in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the inflation makes the money worth less for me, the 500,000 gain is still a good deal, especially since it's a 50/50 split.  There's a good chance Alice will make a less favorable offer in the next round."
