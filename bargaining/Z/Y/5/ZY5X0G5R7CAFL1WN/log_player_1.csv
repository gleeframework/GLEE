I'll propose a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 dollars for myself and giving Bob 100,000 dollars. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point, but I'm also aware of the inflation factor and want to maximize my gains in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to propose an 80/20 split. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I need to incentivize him to accept.  However, I'm also facing the decreasing value of my gains due to inflation, so I can't be too generous."
