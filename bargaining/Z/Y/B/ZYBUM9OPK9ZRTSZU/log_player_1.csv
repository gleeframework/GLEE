"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding. Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 5% less than my original proposal, while Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 20% less than his original proposal.

I'm not sure if I'm being too generous, but I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect in mind, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still want a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is taking a toll on the money's value. My gain of $4500 is worth 14.26% less than my original proposal, while Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 48.8% less than his original proposal.

Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's still not satisfied with the split. I'll try to make a slight adjustment to see if I can get a better deal.

  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all my share.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly larger share and keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I want more! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is really taking its toll on the money's value. My gain of $4800 is worth 22.62% less than my original proposal, while Bob's gain of $5200 is worth 67.23% less than his original proposal.

Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's being quite stubborn. I'm not sure if I want to give him a larger share, but I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.
