"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80, you can have 20. Let's play nice!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 80, I'll give you 10 more, but I'm not going all the way! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth less due to inflation, so I'll have to be careful.

I'll think for a moment... 

I'm not thrilled about taking only 10, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
