"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, a fair and straightforward proposal to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain of $200,000 is worth less than it was in the first round, so I'm getting a smaller share of the total value of the money.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping the inflation will make my gain worth more in relative terms."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain! With a 14.26% decrease in value, my $100,000 gain is now worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. If I reject it, the money will continue to decrease in value, and I might end up with even less. On the other hand, accepting this offer would give me a relatively small amount of money, but at least I'd have some cash.

I'll think carefully about this one...

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping the inflation will make my gain worth more in relative terms. I need to be careful not to leave too much on the table, but I also don't want to give away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain now! With a 22.62% decrease in value, my $50,000 gain is now worth a tiny fraction of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'm getting desperate. If I reject it, the money will continue to decrease in value, and I might end up with nothing. On the other hand, accepting this offer would give me a tiny amount of money, but at least I'd have some cash.

I'll think carefully about this one...
