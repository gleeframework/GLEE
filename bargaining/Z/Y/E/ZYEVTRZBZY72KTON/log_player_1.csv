"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see where it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than 50/50. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $3200 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting less than 50% of the total, I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain of $3200 from the previous round is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $2560 in the current round.

I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short, but this is getting closer to what I had in mind. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $2560 from the previous round is now worth 51.2% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $2560 * 0.512 = $1312 in the current round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting $4500, which is equivalent to $4500 / 0.8 = $5625 in the first round. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll think about it for a moment... and then reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $1312 from the previous round is now worth 48.8% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $1312 / 0.488 = $268.06 in the current round.

I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still not satisfied with the offers so far. Let's try to meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm going back to a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
