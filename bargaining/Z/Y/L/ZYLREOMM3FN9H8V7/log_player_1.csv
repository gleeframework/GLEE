Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, as I'll be losing 10% of my share each round, while you only lose 5%. Let's work together and find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
