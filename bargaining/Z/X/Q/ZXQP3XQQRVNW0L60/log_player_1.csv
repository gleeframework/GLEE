"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair to take into account the different inflation rates. This way, we both get a decent share with the slight advantage going to me, considering my money loses value faster. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
