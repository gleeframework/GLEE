"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting 80% of the initial $100 and Bob getting 20%. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can move on to the next round."
