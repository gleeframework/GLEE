At this point, accepting the offer is the best option. Even though I'm getting a significantly lower amount than I initially wanted, the inflation has decreased the value of my potential gains significantly. Accepting this offer ensures that I at least get a sizable portion of the money, even though it's less than what I initially hoped for.  The risk of continuing to reject offers and potentially ending up with nothing is too high."
