Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but we both need to be reasonable.  Inflation is a serious factor, and I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 55/45, with me taking 55% and you taking 45%.  This way, we both get a decent return, and we don't risk the value of the money decreasing further.
