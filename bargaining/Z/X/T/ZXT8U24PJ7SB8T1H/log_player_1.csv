"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 600,000 dollars, leaving 400,000 for Bob. The message is just a friendly hello!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth less due to inflation, but Bob's offer seems reasonable.

I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
