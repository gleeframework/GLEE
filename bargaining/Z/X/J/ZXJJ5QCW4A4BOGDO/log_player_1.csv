I propose that I receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000.  This seems like a fair starting point, giving me a slightly larger share to reflect the fact that my money depreciates at a slower rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300}
``` 

I'm going to increase my proposed share slightly to reflect that Bob's money is depreciating faster.  Let's see if this is acceptable to him."
