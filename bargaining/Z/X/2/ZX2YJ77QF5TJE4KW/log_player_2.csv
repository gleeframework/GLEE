Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't take my first offer, now it's a bit less for you 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Alice. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my previous offers, now it's even less for you 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While it's frustrating, accepting an offer where I get significantly less than a fair deal is a bad strategy. There's a chance Alice will panic as the rounds progress and offer a more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you win. I'll take your original offer.  Any more rounds and it'll be worthless!""}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm accepting Alice's original offer, even though it's not ideal.  Here's why:

* **Inflation is Hurting:**  Every round that passes significantly diminishes my gains due to the 5% inflation. 
* **Alice is Stubborn:**  Alice has shown no willingness to budge from her initial stance. It's likely she'll continue to whittle down my potential gains.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** If I continue to reject offers, there's a real chance I'll end up with a pittance due to the inflation, especially if Alice is willing to drag this out. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but strategically, it's the best option at this point."
