I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us receiving $500,000."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

I'm not satisfied with the 40/60 split, as I was hoping for a more equal division. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
