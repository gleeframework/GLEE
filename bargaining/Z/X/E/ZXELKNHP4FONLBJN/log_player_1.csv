Let's see if Bob is generous enough to accept a 90/10 split.  I'm being generous, but I want to get as much of the money as possible!  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While I'm getting 2,000, Bob is getting 8,000 and his money is worth less due to inflation!  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split.  Bob's money is worth less now than in the first round, and I'm still getting a good deal! Let's see if he'll take it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept. My money is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's is worth a lot less. While I'd prefer to get more, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round."
