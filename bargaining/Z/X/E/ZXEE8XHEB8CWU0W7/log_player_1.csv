{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping to get most of the money, but I want to make sure Bob gets something so he's likely to accept in the first round.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Bob is trying to take advantage of me by offering me a much smaller share than I proposed.  I'm not going to give in so easily. I'll see what I can do in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm reducing my share a bit, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see that this is a fair deal and accept. Let's see how this goes."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm not going to accept a deal where he gets 80% of the money, even if the value has decreased for both of us. I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm dropping my share again, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise, and we can finally reach an agreement."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the value of the money is decreasing, I'm not ready to accept a deal where I'm getting only 40% of the money. I'm still confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm dropping my share to 60% to show I'm serious about reaching an agreement. This is a fair offer considering the inflation, and hopefully, Bob will finally see that we can both get a decent amount of money."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy. I'm not willing to settle for a deal where I get less than half the money, even considering the inflation. I'll try to get a better offer in the next round."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're running out of time, and the value of the money is rapidly declining. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the fairest way to divide the money at this point, considering the inflation.  Let's hope Bob sees reason and accepts."
