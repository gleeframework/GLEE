Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. We both know the value of the money is decreasing with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the declining value of money means Alice still benefits more in the long run. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open and allows me to push for a slightly more advantageous deal in later rounds."
