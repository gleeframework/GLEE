"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is a friendly and cooperative approach to initiate the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a slightly better split for me this time.  Let's not lose too much to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because a 45-55 split is still not favorable enough for me, considering I started with a more generous 60-40 split in my favor. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal, despite the 10% decrease in value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering a 58-42 split in my favor, which is a compromise between my initial 60-40 split and Bob's 45-55 split. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" conveys my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable solution. I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer to account for the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This seems like a fair deal considering we are losing money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite the decreasing value of the money, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. A 48-52 split is closer to my target, but I'd like to try to get an even more favorable split. Additionally, Bob's message seems to be trying to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not ready to settle yet. I'll make another offer in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Getting closer, but I need a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering a 56-44 split in my favor, which is a slight concession from my previous offer, but still more favorable to me than Bob's last offer. The message ""Getting closer, but I need a bit more"" acknowledges that we're making progress in the negotiation, but also clearly communicates that I'm not yet satisfied with the split. I'm trying to balance the need to reach an agreement with the need to get a good deal, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting dangerously close to losing a significant chunk to inflation.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (40.95% less than the initial amount), I've decided to accept Bob's offer. A 49-51 split is not ideal, but the looming threat of further inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds make this offer more acceptable. Bob's message also implies that this is his final offer, so I'm taking him at his word and choosing to secure a deal rather than risking further negotiations."
