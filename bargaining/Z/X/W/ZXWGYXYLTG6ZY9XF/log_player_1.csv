"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share to start, but still fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to be more cautious about accepting a smaller share. However, 45 is still a decent amount, and it's a fair offer considering the slight increase in Bob's share.
