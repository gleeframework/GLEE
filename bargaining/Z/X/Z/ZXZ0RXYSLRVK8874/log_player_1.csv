I'm going for a slightly unfair but not outrageous offer in the first round.  I want to see if Bob is willing to be cooperative or if he's going to play a more aggressive game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to show some flexibility.  I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I want to show that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split.  I've realized that Bob is being very stubborn, and I'm not willing to keep going back and forth with such a large disparity.  A fair split is the most likely way to end this game."
