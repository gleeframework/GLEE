"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $10 and keep $90 for myself. This way, I get a significant majority of the money, but still leave Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll adjust my decision accordingly.

I accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll get $40 and Bob will get $60. It's a fair deal considering the reduced value of the money."
