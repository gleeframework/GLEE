"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 40/60 split. I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going below 55%""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
