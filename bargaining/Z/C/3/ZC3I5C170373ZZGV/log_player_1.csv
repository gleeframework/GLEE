"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering a large portion of the money to Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept in the first round and avoid the risk of inflation devaluing the money further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Inflation will continue to devalue the money, and Bob is clearly willing to bargain. It's better to secure 600,000 now than risk getting less in future rounds."
