"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to take 700,000 dollars, leaving Bob with 300,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It seems like a reasonable split, considering the reduced value of the money."
