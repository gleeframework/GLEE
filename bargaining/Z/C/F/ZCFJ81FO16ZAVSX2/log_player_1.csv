Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not ready to meet in the middle just yet. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills.""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the $4,500 and call it a day. At least I'm getting a decent chunk of the remaining money, and I can live with the thought of Bob getting $5,500."
