"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can split the money quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, let's aim for a fair split 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is still too skewed towards his gain, and I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 81% of its original value due to two rounds of inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. Let's find a fair split before things get worse.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth only 27.1% of its original value, I'll have to be even more careful with my decisions. I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is still too skewed towards his gain, and I'd like to try to get a better deal before the money loses even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth only 22.59% of its original value, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a balance, Bob. Meet me at this middle ground.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth only 15.05% of its original value, I'll have to be extremely cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is still far too skewed towards his gain, and I'd like to try to get a better deal before the money loses even more value. I'm starting to worry that I might end up with almost nothing if I don't get a good deal soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth only 9.55% of its original value, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of patience, Bob. This is my last offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
