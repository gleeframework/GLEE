"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
``` 

I'll start by proposing a very lopsided division.  It's highly unlikely Bob will accept this, but it's a good starting point to see how he reacts.  We'll adjust as we go!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best option.  Bob's offer gives me a substantial amount, and with inflation, his gain is less valuable.  It's likely that if I reject, Bob's next offer will be even more unfavorable due to the further devaluation of his gains."
