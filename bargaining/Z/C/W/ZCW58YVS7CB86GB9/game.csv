700000.0,300000.0,Let's split the money with a 7:3 ratio. This is fair considering the risk and the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share since the money is worth less each round. This 4:6 ratio is a fair starting point for further negotiations.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Considering the decrease in the value of money, I propose a 55:45 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the inflation effect.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 50:50 split. With the rapid inflation, I think it's essential to prioritize fairness and simplicity in our division. This way, we can both walk away with a decent share of the remaining value.",Bob,4,
