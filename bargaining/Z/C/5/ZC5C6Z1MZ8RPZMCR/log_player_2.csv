Let's see if we can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor this time. It's a fair starting point.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it evenly this time. I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the decreasing value of the money. Accepting this offer secures a decent amount for both of us."
