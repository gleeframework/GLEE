55.0,45.0,Let's start fair.  I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  I think it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial outcome.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. How about we switch it around for this round?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's try an even split this time.  It seems like neither of us wants to be too greedy.  A 50/50 split is fair and avoids any further negotiation.,Alice,3,
