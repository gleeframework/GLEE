"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly. I'll take a bigger share to start, but we can work out a better arrangement later if you'd prefer. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's proposal is tempting, I'd prefer to see how the inflation impacts her decisions before settling for such a small share. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more balanced split. We can adjust later if needed, but I'd like to avoid too much inflation before we agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair this time.  We're both losing money with each round.  A 50/50 split is the most sensible way to avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

With the inflation hitting hard, a 50/50 split is the most sensible option at this point. Accepting avoids further losses and ensures a decent payout."
