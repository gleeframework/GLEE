Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as it's a good deal for both of us.  Since it's the first round, the value of the money hasn't been significantly affected by inflation yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is fair, and given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing, I'm willing to accept."
