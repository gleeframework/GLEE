  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split, but still taking into account the decreasing value of money. This way, we can both get a decent amount in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
