"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be practical, Bob. Take this generous offer and we can both enjoy the money.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer aims to capitalize on the time pressure Bob faces. Since he doesn't experience inflation, he might be tempted to wait for a larger share later. However, by offering a significant portion upfront, Alice incentivizes a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, Alice. This is a more fair split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is framed as ""fairer"", it's significantly worse for Alice than her previous offer, especially considering the 5% inflation.  Alice needs to push back and demonstrate she won't accept a bad deal, hoping Bob will become more reasonable as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking and this offer is more than fair to you. Don't be greedy.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Alice mirrors Bob's strategy from the previous round, offering him a slightly worse deal than he proposed but still positioning it as ""fair."" 
* **Time Pressure:** The message again emphasizes the shrinking pot due to inflation, hoping to make Bob more agreeable. 
* **Slight Compromise:** While Alice holds her ground, the offer is still a compromise from her Round 1 proposal, signaling she's willing to negotiate but won't be lowballed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any less patient, Alice. This is my new offer. Consider the decreasing value of your share. 
# Alice gain: 425000 
# Bob gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation factor, and this offer is unacceptable. While the decreasing value is a concern, folding now would mean a significant loss compared to Alice's initial offer. It's time to show Bob that Alice is serious about not being taken advantage of."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be fair, but this back and forth is pointless. This is a final offer. Take it or leave it, but the pot shrinks every round.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  The message firmly establishes this as a ""take it or leave it"" offer, adding pressure on Bob. 
* **Calculated Risk:** Alice slightly lowers her demand from Round 3 but maintains a position more advantageous than what Bob offered. It's a gamble, but the strong stance might push Bob to settle.
* **Inflation Reminder:**  The message reiterates the time pressure, highlighting the shrinking pot and subtly implying Bob has more to lose by prolonging the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said the pot shrinks every round, but only for you. I'm not feeling the pressure. This is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but Alice needs to cut her losses.  Here's why:

* **Bob's Stance:** His message indicates he's not fazed by the time pressure and is comfortable letting the rounds continue, putting more pressure on Alice.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While $400,000 is significantly less than Alice's initial goal, accepting now avoids a worse outcome in subsequent rounds due to inflation. Waiting any longer will likely result in even less favorable offers. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will ever offer a share above $400,000. He seems content to wait Alice out, and her bargaining position weakens with each passing round.

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting now secures Alice a reasonable sum, even if it's not her ideal outcome."
