Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a very small share, hoping he'll accept it quickly and we can avoid the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, it's likely that Bob will continue to offer a 50/50 split in the future rounds. With inflation hurting Bob more than me, it's best to accept this offer and avoid further losses."
