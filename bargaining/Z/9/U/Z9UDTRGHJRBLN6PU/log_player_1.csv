"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the cash!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is quite generous. However, I'm not ready to give up yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a bit more than I did in the first round, but still trying to keep the advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'm not giving in yet! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting desperate indeed!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth around 45% of the original amount, which is a significant reduction. I'm not sure if I should take it or wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the further inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! Meet me at 49/51 and let's finalize the deal!""
}
```

I'm getting close to the original 50/50 split, but I'm still trying to squeeze out a slight advantage."
