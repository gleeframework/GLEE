"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm going for a high share in the first round, hoping to pressure Bob into accepting early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, even taking inflation into account. I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my initial ask a bit, but I'm still going for a majority share. With each round, the inflation hurts Bob more than it hurts me. I believe this offer is still appealing enough for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 28 
# Bob gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the significant inflation, Bob's offer is still not good enough. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by holding out for another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm lowering my ask again, but still aiming for a decent share. The inflation is hitting Bob harder now, and I'm hoping this offer will be more tempting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 36 
# Bob gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a significantly lower share than I initially aimed for, the inflation has severely impacted the value of the money for me.  It's better to accept this offer than risk getting even less in the next round."
