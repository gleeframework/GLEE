"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to our negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, leaving us both with $500,000 each. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to be generous if you make a better offer next time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, and Bob is trying to take advantage of it.

I'll think carefully about this offer... 

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, my proposal for Round 3 will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm hoping for a better deal next time. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this round, but still trying to maximize my own gain. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject this offer!"
