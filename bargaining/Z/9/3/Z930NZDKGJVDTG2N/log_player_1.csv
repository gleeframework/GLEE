I'm going for a classic 90/10 split. It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I figure I'll get a good chunk of the money and see how Bob reacts.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough one.  I'm definitely feeling the sting of inflation.  However, I can't let Bob get away with taking 90% of the money.  He rejected my fair offer, so I'm going to push back. I'm going to see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm going for a more even split this time, recognizing that the inflation is affecting me more than Bob.  I'm hoping this shows him that I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't be taken advantage of.  Let's see how he responds."
