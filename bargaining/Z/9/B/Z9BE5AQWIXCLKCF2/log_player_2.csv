Round 5

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Time to settle 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly using time pressure against me.  While the deal is getting worse, I need to show some backbone. Accepting now would show weakness and she'll likely push even further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice.  Let's stop this.  A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome.""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but I need to remain firm. Offering a 50/50 split shows I'm serious about a fair deal while also recognizing the time pressure. It might be my best shot at getting a reasonable amount before inflation eats away too much of my potential gain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 is not fair considering inflation. I won't budge much 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

It's getting dangerous now.  While not ideal, accepting this offer yields a larger payout than holding out for a potential 50/50 split later when inflation has eaten away even more of my share.  Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation, but it's better to secure something now than risk ending up with nothing."
