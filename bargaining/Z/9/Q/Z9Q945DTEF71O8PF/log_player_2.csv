Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  The offer is heavily affected by inflation. Bob's gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, while Alice's gain is only 9.75% less.  
* **Fairness:**  While the initial offer was 600,000 for Alice and 400,000 for Bob, this offer is a much more even split, with each player receiving 500,000.
* **Risk:**  If Bob rejects this offer, the next round will see a further reduction in the value of the money for Bob.  There's no guarantee that Alice will offer a better deal in the future.

**In short, it's better to accept the offer and get a relatively fair split, rather than risk getting a significantly lower value in the next round.**"
