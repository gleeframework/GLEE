7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This offers a reasonable balance considering the risk of inflation in future rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair.  This allows us to both get a decent amount, and it avoids the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Considering the inflation, I propose a 54/46 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the decreasing value of money in each subsequent round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it evenly. We've both been stubborn, and with each round, the money loses value. A 50/50 split ensures we both get a fair amount before the inflation eats away at it further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
