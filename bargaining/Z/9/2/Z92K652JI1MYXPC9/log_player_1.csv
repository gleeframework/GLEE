"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair deal, let's end the game here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest way to go. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $500,000 is actually worth $450,000.

I'm not sure if this is the fairest way to split the money, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
