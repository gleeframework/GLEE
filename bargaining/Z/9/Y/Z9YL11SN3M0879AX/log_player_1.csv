"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to get a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $40 is worth 95% of the original $50, which is $47.00.

Bob's gain of $60 is worth 80% of the original $50, which is $40.00.

Considering the proposal, I'm not too thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
