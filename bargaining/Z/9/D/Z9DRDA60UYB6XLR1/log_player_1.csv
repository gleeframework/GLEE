Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a smaller portion, as I want to maximize my own gains. Since we're in the first round, I don't know how the inflation will affect him, so I'm taking a slightly risky approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have liked to get more, the inflation is clearly affecting Bob more than me. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, and it's likely that if I reject, the next round will be even worse for me due to inflation."
