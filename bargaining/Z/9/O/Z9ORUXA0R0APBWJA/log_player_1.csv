Let's see how Bob responds! I'm hoping for a fair split, but I'm ready to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not giving in so easily."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm willing to compromise a little, but I'm still aiming for a larger share since I'm the one making the offer now. I'll see if Bob is more reasonable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation.  Even though I'm not getting as much as I'd like,  it's better than losing more money in the next round."
