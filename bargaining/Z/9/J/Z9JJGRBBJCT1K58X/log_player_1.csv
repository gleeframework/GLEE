"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll think it's a fair starting point and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70% of the total, I'll try to negotiate a better deal by offering a smaller share to Bob. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60% is a more reasonable split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the initial offer was quite low. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of Bob's offer, I'll have to consider the offer carefully. Since Bob is meeting me halfway, I'll have to think about whether it's a good idea to accept.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, as it seems like a reasonable compromise:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
