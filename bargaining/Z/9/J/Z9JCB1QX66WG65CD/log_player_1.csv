"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm leaving room for negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered me a fair split, but I think I deserve more. This is my counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants more, huh?

I'll consider his offer, taking into account the inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your counteroffer is quite aggressive. I'm willing to give you a better deal, but not that extreme.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and challenging him to come up with something more reasonable. Your turn, Bob!"

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is a more generous offer than before.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. This is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, and I'm hoping he'll accept it. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to accept a lower share than before. I'll meet you halfway, but I'll take the higher share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to stick to his guns!

However, I notice that his offer is the same as my previous offer, and considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll have to make a decision based on the current value of the money.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept the same offer as before, especially since the money is worth less now. I'll try to do better.""
}
```

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly higher share, but I still need to keep a decent amount for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $480,000 and keeping $520,000 for myself. This is a bit more generous than my previous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 6

# Bob's message: It's getting late, let's split it down the middle. I'm not going to push for more. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting tired and wants to split it down the middle!

Considering the inflation, the money is worth significantly less now, and I'm not sure if it's the best deal I can get. However, it's a fair split, and it's better than continuing to negotiate.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's call it a day. A 50/50 split is a fair deal, considering the circumstances.""
}
