Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was a bit too much on your side. This is more balanced considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  This offer is fair and avoids us both losing out completely. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining and the value of the money decreasing rapidly for both players, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly with each rejection. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a better offer in later rounds might seem tempting, but the effects of inflation mean even a slightly better split later will be worth significantly less than Alice's current offer. 
* **Alice's Likely Strategy:** Alice is likely aware of the time pressure and inflation, her offer is becoming more reasonable.  If she continues on this trajectory, future offers might not be significantly better than what's on the table now.

Accepting a less-than-ideal offer is sometimes the best strategic decision, especially when time is a factor and the alternative is potentially losing everything."
