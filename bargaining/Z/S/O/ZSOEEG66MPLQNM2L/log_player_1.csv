Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, with inflation, accepting this offer means I still gain a decent amount (even though it's 5% less than the initial round).  Since the next round would be at a further reduced value, it's better to take what's offered now."
