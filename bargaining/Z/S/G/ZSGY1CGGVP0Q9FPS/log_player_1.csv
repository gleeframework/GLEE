"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better offer, but you have to take it now! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the value of the money I gain in this round, which is $300,000, and compare it to the value of the money Bob gains, which is 20% less than in the first round.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually quite generous, and I think I'll accept it.
