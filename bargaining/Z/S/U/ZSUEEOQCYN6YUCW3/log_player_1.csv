Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and leave Bob with $1,000. I want to maximize my share in the first round while still being somewhat fair. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even with the inflation, taking $6,000 is a better deal than risking another round and potentially getting even less."
