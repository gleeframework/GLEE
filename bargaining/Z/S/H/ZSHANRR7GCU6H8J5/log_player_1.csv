"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
This is a relatively balanced offer, but I'm hoping Bob will think I'm being generous and accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take the lion's share!

I'll reject his offer:
```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Time to make a counteroffer!

Here's my next proposal:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```
This is a slight adjustment from my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more than Bob's last offer!"
