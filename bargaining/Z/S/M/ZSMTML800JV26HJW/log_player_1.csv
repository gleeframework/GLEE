"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I'm going to start with a very simple proposal.  I want 90% of the money, and leave Bob with 10%.  This should be good enough to get us started and see what his reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is exactly the opposite of my offer. He wants 90% and is giving me only 10%. I'm not going to accept that. I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my demand slightly, hoping to reach a compromise. I'll take 80% and give Bob 20%.  Hopefully this is more reasonable for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering me 20%, while I'm losing more and more value each round. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal.  We're both being unreasonable at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to keep lowering my demand, even though the money is worth less for me now. I'm hoping that by showing I'm willing to negotiate, Bob will eventually compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too far off from what I'm willing to accept.  Even though the value of the money is decreasing, I'm determined to get a better deal. I'm going to counter-offer again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to keep reducing my demand, hoping that Bob will eventually see reason. With each round, the value of the money decreases, but I'm still confident I can get a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering a very uneven split.  I'm losing more and more value with each round, but I'm determined to hold out for a better deal. I'm going to counter with my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I've reached my limit.  The value of the money is dropping rapidly, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. This offer is a 50/50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will finally see the need for a compromise."
