"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. With inflation, the money is worth 10% less each round, but I'm willing to take that risk to try to get more than 40% of the original amount. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is money Bob, literally! Let's settle this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting this offer because, considering the inflation, 45% of the original amount is a relatively good deal at this point. The money has already lost 19% of its value, and it will continue to decrease in value with each passing round. I think it's better to settle now and get 45% rather than risking another round and possibly getting less."
