Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced, accepting an offer this low puts Bob at a significant disadvantage.  It's worth risking a few more rounds to negotiate a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. We both lose with each round. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

At this stage, emphasizing fairness and the speed of resolution is key. A 50/50 split, while not ideal considering the inflation disparity, presents a strong argument:

* **Simplicity:** It's easy to understand and agreeable in principle.
* **Time Pressure:**  The message underscores the urgency created by the dwindling value of the money.
* **Potential Loss Aversion:**  Alice is more likely to lose a larger percentage with each rejected offer, making her more amenable to a deal."
