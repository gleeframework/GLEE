Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you want a more even split, but I still think I can get a bit more. This is a slight compromise on my original offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging, and the longer this goes on, the more we both lose.  I need to signal I'm serious about a more even split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
