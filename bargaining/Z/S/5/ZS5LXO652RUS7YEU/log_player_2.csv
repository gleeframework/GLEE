Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can see. I'll give you a little more than last time, but not much. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a game of chicken with the inflation, hoping I'll panic and take a bad deal.  While the value is getting worse for me each round, it's still better to hold out hope for a better than 43/57 split. I need to show some spine and make her nervous."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 47,
""alice_gain"": 53,
""message"": ""This is a compromise, Alice. Take it before the inflation eats away at my share even further, and you end up with a worse deal.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, considering the inflation is only affecting you. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  The 73.79% inflation puts enormous pressure on me. While 44/56 isn't a great split, it's better than risking getting closer to zero with each passing round.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this stage, as she knows the pressure I'm under."
