"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25$ for me and 75$ for her, I'll offer a slightly lower amount to her. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30,
""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain is worth 9.75% less and Alice's gain is worth 36% less, I'll try to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this case, I think I'll accept Alice's offer from round 3.
