"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40. Let's see if we can do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively fair split, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split this time. Let's see if you'll accept it! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 50 is actually worth 95% of the original amount, which is $47.50.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 50 or 40, since the inflation effect on his side is 20% less, but I'll assume it's 50 for now.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90.25% of the original amount (95% of 95% = 90.25%).

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You didn't accept the fair split, so I'll take a slightly bigger share this time. You can have 45.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share this time. Maybe you'll accept it? 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 70 is actually worth 85.7% of the original amount (100 - 14.26% = 85.7%).

I'm not sure how much Bob's gain is worth, but I'll assume it's 30 for now.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to accept it, since it's a better deal than my previous offer and I'm not sure if I'll get a better one in the next round.
