"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. This ensures you get a good deal and we avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our gains in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting, the 60/40 split favors Alice too much. Since the money loses value more for her with each round, I can potentially get a better deal by rejecting and proposing a different split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This reflects the fact that the money depreciates faster for you, and it gives us a chance to secure a deal before inflation bites too hard.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. This is a counter-proposal, acknowledging the inflation but still offering a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, this offer is fair considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting. It's better to secure a deal now."
