"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

**Explanation:**

I propose to keep 95% of the money ($950,000) and give Bob the remaining 5% ($50,000). This is a starting point that gives me a significant share, but still allows for the potential for negotiation in future rounds.  

**Remember:** I'm not aware of how inflation affects Bob, so I'm playing it safe by keeping the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting at first glance, we need to consider the inflation effects.

* **My gain:** My potential gain is $400,000, but after the 5% inflation, it becomes $380,000.
* **Bob's gain:** Bob's potential gain is $600,000, but after the 20% inflation, it becomes $480,000.

Even though my share seems lower, I am still getting a larger percentage of the total money after inflation.  It's in my best interest to reject this offer and see what Bob proposes in the next round, hoping he'll adjust to the new inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm adjusting my offer based on the information from the previous round.  Here's my reasoning:

* **Bob's offer:**  Bob was willing to give me 40% of the money in the last round, even with inflation. This indicates he may be willing to compromise. 
* **Inflation:**  I've experienced a 5% reduction in the value of my gains, so I'm aiming for a larger share to offset that loss.
* **Negotiation:** By offering 65% of the money, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a significant share.

I'm hopeful this offer will be accepted, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

This is a much better deal for me than the previous offer. Even with the inflation, my share of the money is likely to be significantly higher than Bob's. 

Here's the breakdown:

* **My gain:** My potential gain is $500,000, which after a 14.26% reduction due to inflation becomes approximately $428,571.
* **Bob's gain:**  Bob's potential gain is also $500,000, but after a 48.8% reduction, it becomes approximately $256,000.

This offer gives me a much larger share of the money, even with inflation, and I'm confident this is the best I can do at this point. It's time to accept and end this game."
