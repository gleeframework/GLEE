"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable offer!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want something too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept it. I was hoping for a better deal, especially since the money is worth less now.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and 40% less than in the first round, I need to be even more cautious with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and leaving $45 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I really need some too! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob is offering me a larger share than before. However, I'm not sure if I should accept it. 80% of the remaining $100 is $80, but considering the inflation, the actual value is lower.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less, I need to be more careful with my offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50, it's the fairest way to go.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 50% of the remaining $100, which is $50, and leaving $50 for Bob. This way, we can both get a fair share, considering the decreasing value of the money."
