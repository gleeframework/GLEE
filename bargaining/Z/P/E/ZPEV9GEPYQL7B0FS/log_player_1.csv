"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm trying to be generous to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. It's a fair deal and avoids the risk of inflation hurting us both. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'm now effectively gaining 7200 dollars (8000 * 0.9).

I don't think this offer is as good as the first one I made, considering the inflation. I'd rather not accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (7200 * 0.9 = 6480). I'll try to make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share to account for the risk of inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a little more to compensate for the inflation we've experienced. But, I'm still aiming for a compromise to finish the game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. My gain is now worth 58.4% of what it was in the first round (8000 * 0.271 = 2176). Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a decent compromise given the circumstances.
