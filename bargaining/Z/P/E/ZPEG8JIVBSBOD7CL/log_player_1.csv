Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, 60-40 is still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 4000. Let's split it 45-55, a fair deal considering the inflation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you hard, I'll give you 3500, it's better than getting less in the next round 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'm getting a much smaller share than I initially hoped for, the inflation means accepting this offer is the best option.  If I reject, I risk getting even less in the next round."
