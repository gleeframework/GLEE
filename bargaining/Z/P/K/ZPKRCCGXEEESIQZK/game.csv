7000.0,3000.0,I propose we divide the money in a 7:3 ratio. This ensures a fair split considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This recognizes my advantage in the coming rounds due to the inflation affecting you more heavily. It's a fair compromise considering the dynamic of the game.,Bob,2,
