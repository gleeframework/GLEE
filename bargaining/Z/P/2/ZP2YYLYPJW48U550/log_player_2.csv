**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly enjoying this and pushing her advantage. I need to show some backbone here.  While the value is getting worse, I still have a few rounds to make her sweat a little.  It's better to get a less advantageous deal in a later round than reward this behavior now."

# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is killing me, and Alice is clearly willing to run this out. I'm getting dangerously close to the point where even a 50/50 split would be a loss compared to what I could have gotten initially. Better to cut my losses now and take a less-than-ideal deal than risk getting almost nothing."
