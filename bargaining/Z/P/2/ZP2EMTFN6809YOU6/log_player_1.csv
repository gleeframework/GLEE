"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm trying to get a good chunk of the money upfront to account for the potential inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5000 is now worth 80% of the original value, which is 4000. Bob's gain of 5000 is also worth 80% of the original value, which is 4000. This is a 50/50 split, which seems reasonable. I accept this offer.
