"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%""
}
```

I'm offering a 80-20 split, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered 80% in round 1. I'll offer 60% to you this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, and Bob's offer is 60% of the original $1,000,000, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In this round, the total amount of money is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, since 100% - 10% = 90%.

So, my gain of $400,000 in this round is worth 90% of $400,000, which is $360,000.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and looking forward to making my next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less this time. You're getting closer to the 60% you offered last round.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than his previous offer, but still a good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up on 60%. You're still too high at 55%. 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less each round! In this round, the total amount of money is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%).

My gain of $460,000 in this round is worth 72.9% of $460,000, which is $334,620.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to your 60% offer. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair compromise and might be more appealing to Bob."
