"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose that Alice receives $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000.  This gives me a large share, but also leaves a decent amount for Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get a significant portion of the money and avoids the risk of losing everything due to inflation."
