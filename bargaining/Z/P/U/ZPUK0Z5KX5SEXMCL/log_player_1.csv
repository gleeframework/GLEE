"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This way, I get 60% and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since we're now in a situation where we're both proposing equal splits, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll aim to get a bigger share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm trying to get a slightly higher share, but not too high to leave Bob with a very small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! Given the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is closer to a 52-48 split, which is a relatively fair division, I'll consider accepting this offer.
