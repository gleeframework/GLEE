"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, which is $80, and giving Bob $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you more next time, but this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $60, which is still a decent amount considering the inflation."
