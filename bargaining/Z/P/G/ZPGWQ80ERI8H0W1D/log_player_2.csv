Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  I'll take a little less than last time, you take a little more.  Let's wrap this up before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
