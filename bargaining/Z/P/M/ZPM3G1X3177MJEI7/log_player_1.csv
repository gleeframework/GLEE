"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very generous (to me) first offer, leaving Bob with a small amount but making sure I get the majority. This will hopefully incentivize him to accept, as he gets something instead of nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing in the end. It's a significant gain compared to the previous round and a good starting point for negotiation in the future rounds."
