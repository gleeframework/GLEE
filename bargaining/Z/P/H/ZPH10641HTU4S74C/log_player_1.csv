I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me getting 900,000 and Bob getting 100,000. I'm aiming for a large share early on, hoping to secure a good deal before inflation significantly diminishes the value of the money."

I'm going back to a 70/30 split.  We're nearing the halfway point of the game, and while inflation is a factor, I'm still aiming for a comfortable majority share."

While inflation has taken a big bite out of the value, it's better to get something than nothing at this point.  I'll accept Bob's offer to get at least some money."
