"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, we can reassess later if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for future negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about inflation in this case.

I'll consider Bob's offer. I'd rather not take a smaller share, so I'll reject this offer.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this time""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by $50,000 from the initial offer, but still leaving room for negotiation."

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000
