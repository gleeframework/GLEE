"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to consider the relative values.

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain: 450,000 (worth 100% for me, no change)
Bob's gain: 550,000 (worth 95% for Bob, since it's 5% less due to inflation)

Considering the relative values, I think this offer is a good one for me. I'll accept it.
