"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split: 90% for me, 10% for you. Let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
It's not a fair split at all, and I know I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This is a fair split, given the inflation. Let's end this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a better split, I'm concerned about inflation and the risk of getting nothing in future rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
