"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose that I receive $90 and Bob receives $10. This is a relatively generous offer to start the game. I think it's likely he will accept, but I am willing to negotiate if he chooses to go to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I would have received $90 in the previous round, now I am only offered $60. This is a significant drop, and I believe I can get a better deal if we move to the next round. I am willing to negotiate further, but I am confident that I can secure a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I propose that I receive $70 and Bob receives $30.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I've adjusted my proposal to be more appealing.  I believe this offer represents a fair compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that I will be making the next proposal if this one is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  While the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money, I believe that accepting a 50/50 split is the best strategy at this point. If I reject this offer, the next round will see further inflation, and I risk ending up with less than I have now."
