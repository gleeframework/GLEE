"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can re-evaluate if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $3000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $2700 in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
