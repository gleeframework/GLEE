Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer from Round 1 is still the best option for you. If you reject this, I will keep lowering my offer in the next rounds. It's better to take a decent deal now than risk losing more with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
