"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. This is a 70-30 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
