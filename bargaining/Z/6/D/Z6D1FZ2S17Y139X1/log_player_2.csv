"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly to be fair. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, which is the most fair and reasonable proposal, I see no reason to reject it and risk getting nothing or a worse deal in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me $5000, which is half of the total amount, and concludes the game on a mutually beneficial note."
