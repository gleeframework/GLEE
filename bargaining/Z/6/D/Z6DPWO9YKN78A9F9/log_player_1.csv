Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to get this over with quickly.  I'm willing to take a small hit to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see if he's happy with it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a bit more,  it's likely Bob will continue to propose a 50/50 split in future rounds.  The inflation rate is significant, and accepting this offer is the best way to minimize potential losses."
