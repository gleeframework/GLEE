"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! You can have a small share, but I'll take the majority. Consider it a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share of $1000, and I'll take the remaining $9000."

Round 2

# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice! I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm not ready to give up yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, Bob, but I can do better than that. I'm not giving up yet!""
