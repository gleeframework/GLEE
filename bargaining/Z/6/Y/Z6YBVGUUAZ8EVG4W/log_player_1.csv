"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll consider the effective gain as 60% of the original 60 I was offered, which is 36.

Bob's offer is 50, which is more than my effective gain. I'll accept this offer.
