I'm going to offer Bob a small amount and try to get a quick agreement. Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I don't want to risk many rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm still better off waiting another round and making my own offer. I know that Bob is also losing value, so I can likely get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 72, ""bob_gain"": 28}
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground this time. While I'm losing value with each round, I need to keep in mind that Bob is also losing value. I'm offering him a slightly larger share, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something before the money becomes worthless."
