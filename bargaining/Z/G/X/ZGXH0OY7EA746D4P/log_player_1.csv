"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the first 60 and you can have the remaining 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more equitable. It's closer to a 50/50 split, and we both benefit from getting more than your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I do appreciate Bob's willingness to compromise. Considering the inflation, I think this offer is a decent one.
