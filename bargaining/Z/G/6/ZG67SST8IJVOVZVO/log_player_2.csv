I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}

I'm going to try to flip the offer from Alice.  I'll take 6000 and give Alice 4000.  Let's see if she'll accept!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject the offer. While Alice's offer is better than the first round, I think I can still do better, especially with the inflation factor.  I'll see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference this round.  I'll offer 5500 to me and 4500 to Alice.  I think this is a fair deal, given the inflation effect."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with the offer.  Even with the inflation, I think I can get more.  I'll see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200}
```

I'm going to try to flip the offer from Alice again, taking into account the inflation.  I'll offer 5800 to myself and 4200 to Alice. This is a good balance, in my opinion, considering the reduced value of the money over the rounds."
