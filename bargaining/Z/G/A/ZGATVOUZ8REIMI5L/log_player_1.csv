"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a high stake offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round, as the inflation will hurt him more than me in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. I've lost 20% of my potential earnings due to inflation, and continuing the game risks losing even more.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
