Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation impact, I think a 52.5/47.5 split is more reasonable. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000
