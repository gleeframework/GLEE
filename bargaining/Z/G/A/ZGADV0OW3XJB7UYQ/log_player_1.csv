"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to try to maximize my gains in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less to me in the subsequent rounds. I'm offering Bob a small share hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The money is worth less to me with each round, and if I reject, I risk getting nothing in the final round."
