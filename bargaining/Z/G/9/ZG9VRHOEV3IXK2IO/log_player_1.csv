"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think 20% of the remaining value of the money is too low for me, considering the initial offer was 50. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, but I'm willing to give you a chance to make it right! 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains. Given the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think 15 is still too low for me, considering the initial offer was 50 and the decreasing value of the money. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game is getting intense!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced purchasing power.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something reasonable.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent deal for myself, considering the inflation."
