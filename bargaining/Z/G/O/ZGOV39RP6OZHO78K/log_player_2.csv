"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60-40. You can't do better than this! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's early in the game, and there's potential for a better deal.  Let's see if we can negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're pushing for more, Bob. I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not going any lower! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd love to get more, Alice's offer is reasonable, and the inflation is starting to hurt. It's better to take the deal now than risk losing more in the next round."
