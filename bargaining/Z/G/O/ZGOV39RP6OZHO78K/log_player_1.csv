"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to flip the script and get the better deal!

I'll reject this offer, since I'd be getting less than I initially proposed. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for more, Bob. I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not going any lower!""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55-45 in my favor, but I'm still leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
