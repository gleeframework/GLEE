**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently aiming for a larger share while barely budging on her offers. Even though the money is losing value, it's still worth holding out for a better deal. Accepting now would set a precedent that she can keep lowballing me.  There's a risk, but I'm betting Alice will get more reasonable as the rounds progress and the threat of getting $0 looms larger."
