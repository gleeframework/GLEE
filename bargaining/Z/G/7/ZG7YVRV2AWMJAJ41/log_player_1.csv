"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $750,000 and Bob gets $250,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 60/40, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's find a solution we both like. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $320,000 in real terms.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to negotiate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split. I'd like to propose a 55/45 split instead.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, so my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 280000,
  ""bob_gain"": 720000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
