"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the money, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, now it's my turn to make a more realistic offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob wants to take a bigger share this time.

I'll have to be more cautious due to the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less this round, I'll have to think carefully.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""A fair offer considering the decreasing value of the money. Accept and we can move forward!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time, taking into account the ongoing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer is getting closer to my expectations, but I'm still not satisfied 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money I gain, I'll have to be even more cautious. Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'd rather not give up too much.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, hoping that he'll make another proposal that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and it's getting harder to make ends meet.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 630000,
  ""bob_gain"": 370000,
  ""message"": ""A more assertive offer, considering the erosion of the money's value. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm taking a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not taking inflation into account, I'll give you another chance to correct this 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value! It's getting harder to make a living with these decreasing amounts.

I realize now that I should have been more aggressive earlier. Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable, considering the current value of the money. I'll have to swallow my pride and accept this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, hoping that we can finally settle this and move on."
