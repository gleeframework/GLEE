"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the offer. I was hoping for a slightly better deal, considering I'm still making the second proposal. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slight edge.""}

I'm proposing that I get 65% of the initial $100, which is $65, and Bob gets the remaining 35%, which is $35."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly. It's getting late and we're both losing money! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit more desperate!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think it's getting late in the game, and the money is worth less and less with each passing round. Splitting it evenly might not be the most ideal outcome, but it's better than risking getting nothing if we can't agree on a better deal."
