"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the money and Bob 10%.  I'm hoping this is enough to entice him to accept, as he'll be getting something rather than nothing.  However, I'm also aware of the inflation, so I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal.  I'm hoping to leverage the inflation to my advantage in the next round. I can't risk accepting such a lopsided deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more aggressive approach this round.  I'm confident I can get at least 80% of the money.  I'm willing to give Bob a little more than in round 1, but I want to make it clear that I am in the driver's seat."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse.  Even though the inflation has taken a larger bite out of my potential gains, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my initial target."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant majority of the money. The inflation is starting to bite, but I believe Bob will recognize the value of taking a deal before things get worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, which I'm not willing to accept at this point. While the inflation is a serious concern, I still have a few rounds to work with and believe I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm going to slightly increase my offer, hoping to entice Bob to accept. The inflation is reaching a critical point, and I'm willing to take a bit less to avoid a potentially disastrous outcome where we both get nothing. I believe this offer is still fair and gives Bob a significant share, while also securing a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still closer to a 50/50 split than I'm willing to accept.  I'm hoping for a more favorable deal, even with the rapidly increasing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try one last time to secure a majority share. The inflation is getting out of control, but I'm still hoping that Bob will see the value of taking a reasonable offer. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I need to ensure I receive a decent amount to make it worth my time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is now very severe, and the potential loss is getting incredibly high.  While I'd prefer a larger share, at this point, accepting Bob's offer is the best option.  I'm securing a decent amount, and avoiding the risk of getting nothing at all."
