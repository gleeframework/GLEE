7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This ensures a fair share while also providing a reasonable amount for you.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I propose a 55:45 split. This is fairer than the last offer and gives me a larger share to account for the inflation penalty. I hope we can reach an agreement.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
