Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the same. Let's be realistic, time is running out and we're both losing money! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's be reasonable and end this here.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's compromise. I'll meet you in the middle, but we need to do this now before we lose more. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, Alice has moved closer to a more even split, and the effects of inflation are becoming significant. Accepting a 45/55 split now is better than holding out for a slightly better deal and risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds.
