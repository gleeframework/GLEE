"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, considering the potential for inflation. I'm willing to take the majority, but let's work together to make sure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's proposal is a fair split at this moment, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose a deal that will benefit me more in the long run, as the value of the money will decrease with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic.  Inflation will hit us hard, so I'm proposing a split that ensures we both get a substantial amount. This way, we can maximize our gains before the money loses value.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than this. Let's aim for a split that gives us both a significant amount, considering the increasing inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the inflation is starting to bite, I still believe I can get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer keeps me in the driver's seat and gives me another chance to propose a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Inflation is escalating, but we can still find a solution that benefits us both.  I'm proposing a slightly increased share for myself to account for the decreasing value of the money, while still providing you with a substantial amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hurting both of us, so let's find a middle ground.  I propose a 50/50 split to ensure we both receive a fair amount and minimize the impact of the declining value. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is taking a toll, and it's clear that Alice is feeling the pressure too.  Accepting a 50/50 split is the best way to guarantee I get something substantial before the money loses even more value."
