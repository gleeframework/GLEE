"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a fair share, and I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take this or we'll go to round 3! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Since the money is worth 10% less in Round 2, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice gain: 30 * 0.9 = 27
Bob gain: 70 * 0.9 = 63

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still trying to get a decent chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting hard!

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

Alice gain: 20 * 0.729 (since 100 - 27.1 = 72.9, or 72.9% of the original value) = 14.58
Bob gain: 80 * 0.729 = 58.32

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm getting desperate. I'll accept it.
