Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's compromise. I'll come down a bit, you come up a bit. $5500 for me, $4500 for you. We need to act before inflation eats away any more! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still trying to take a bigger chunk, even with the threat of inflation. While the offer is closer to fair, it's worth holding out for a better deal in the next round where I propose.  I believe I can get Alice closer to a 50/50 split, especially as the rounds progress and the pressure of inflation increases."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here. I'll take a slight loss from my last offer, you gain a little - $5200 for me, $4800 for you.  Let's settle this now and not risk losing more! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has agreed to my previous proposal. While it's not a perfect 50/50 split, it's better to accept a slightly favorable deal now than risk getting a worse offer later as inflation continues to erode the value."
