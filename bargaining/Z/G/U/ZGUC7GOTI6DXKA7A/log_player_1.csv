"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going for a slightly unfair but generous offer in the first round. This should hopefully encourage Bob to accept, but if he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation factor means that even though I'm getting less than I initially offered, it's still a decent amount. Accepting ensures I get something, and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
