"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I get a bit more

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but this offer is more equitable while still acknowledging your preference.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:** Both Alice and I lose money due to inflation each round. It's in our best interest to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Fairness:** Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. While I'm willing to negotiate, a near-even split is more reasonable. 
* **Future Leverage:** By offering a slightly better deal than her previous offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to be fair, which may encourage her to accept a less extreme offer in a potential future round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth. Accepting now avoids further losses due to inflation.
* **Improved Offer:** Alice's offer has improved from her initial 60/40 split. While not perfectly equal, it's closer to a fair division.
* **Risk Assessment:**  If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. In fact, her offers might become less generous as the value decreases."
