"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any future complications!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to adjust my offer to be more favorable to myself, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. Here's my next offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
