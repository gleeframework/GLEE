"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal Bob. I believe this is a fair split that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than 40%. I'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Besides, the inflation rate is higher for Alice, so I have more to gain by waiting. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation rate affects you more than me. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value!""}\n\nI'm making a counteroffer that gives me a larger share, while still being somewhat reasonable. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the inflation rate affects Alice more, which might pressure her into accepting this offer before the money loses even more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting me harder. However, your offer was too low. This is my final offer, let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Considering the inflation, Alice's offer is relatively better than before, and I don't think I can negotiate a significantly better deal. Since Alice claims this is her final offer, I'll take it to avoid further devaluation of the money.
