"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game's inflation mechanism."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this quickly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since I'm now worth 20% less, $5,000 is a relatively more significant portion of the remaining amount. However, I'm still not sure if I'm getting the better deal.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not meeting me halfway, so I'll take the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a smaller share than before, but I'm keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're taking too much, I'll give you a smaller share, but I want a larger share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, $3,000 is a relatively smaller amount compared to what I was initially hoping for.

However, considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should take the risk of waiting for a better offer. The fact that Bob is willing to give me $3,000 and take $7,000 for himself is a relatively more generous offer than before.

I'll accept the offer, hoping that I'm making the best decision given the circumstances.
