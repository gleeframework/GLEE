This is a good starting point, but I want to see how the inflation impacts our decisions.  Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's try a 60/40 split, accounting for inflation.  This should give us both a decent outcome.  What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the impact of inflation, let's adjust the split to make it more mutually beneficial. This way, we both get a decent share, and the quicker we agree, the less we lose to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is starting to take a toll, and this offer is still a decent gain for me. It's better to secure a reasonable share now rather than risk losing more in the future rounds."
