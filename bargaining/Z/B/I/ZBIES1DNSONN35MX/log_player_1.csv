"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose a split of 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation in future rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is higher than his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than what I proposed in the first round.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept such a drastic reduction in my share.  I believe I can do better in the future rounds."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the inflation. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I believe a 850,000/150,000 split is a more reasonable compromise given the current circumstances."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous offer, it's still a significant reduction from my initial proposal.  The inflation is impacting my gains, but I am confident I can achieve a more equitable split in the remaining rounds. I am not willing to accept such a low percentage of the total."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a split of 800,000 for me and 200,000 for Bob.  While the inflation is starting to affect my potential earnings, I believe this split is fair and reflects the value I bring to the negotiation.  Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While Bob's offer is closer to a more equitable split, it still falls short of what I believe I deserve, considering the inflation and the fact that I'm taking on more risk by waiting. I'm confident that I can secure a better outcome in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial proposals, it's still not enough considering the significant inflation we're facing. I'm not willing to accept a split that's so heavily weighted in Bob's favor. I'm confident that with a few more rounds left, I can achieve a more equitable outcome.  Let's keep negotiating!"

We are down to the wire!  I am offering a split of 650,000 for me and 350,000 for Bob.  This is a significant concession on my part, but I believe it's the best we can do at this point.  The inflation is very high, and we are nearing the end of our negotiations.  It's time to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

With only one round left, I have no choice but to accept Bob's offer.  The inflation has drastically reduced my potential earnings, and I'm better off taking what I can get than risking getting nothing at all.  While I'm not thrilled with this outcome, it's the most practical option given the circumstances.  I've learned a valuable lesson about the importance of compromise and managing expectations in negotiations."
