"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a split of $9000 for myself and $1000 for Bob.  This feels like a fair starting point, considering the inflation effects will be more impactful for Bob in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to accept this offer.  If I reject, I'll need to propose a split in the next round, and the inflation will make it even harder to get a good deal for myself."
