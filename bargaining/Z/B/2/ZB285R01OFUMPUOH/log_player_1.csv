"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I believe this is a fair offer considering I have the first move.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me $50.  The inflation rate is making the later rounds riskier, so I'll take what I can get now."
