"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60 is a fair share for you. I'll give you a decent amount, but not as much as you initially asked for. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
