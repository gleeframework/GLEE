"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than another round.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The value of the money decreases rapidly for both of us, but especially for Alice. It's in both our best interests to settle quickly.
* **Fairness and Incentive:**  While Alice's first offer was heavily skewed in her favor, I need to offer her something that's at least as good as what she could get in a future round (considering the decreasing value).
* **Strategic Advantage:** By taking the initiative and offering a reasonable deal, I put the pressure on Alice. If she rejects this, she risks getting an even smaller share in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, splitting the difference 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:**  While not ideal, Alice's counter-offer is better than her initial proposal.  The longer this goes on, the less we both gain.
* **Risk Assessment:** If I reject this, there's a chance Alice might propose an even worse deal in a later round, leaving me with a significantly smaller share. 
* **Practicality:**  Continuing to negotiate for a slightly larger slice of a shrinking pie isn't worth the risk at this point."
