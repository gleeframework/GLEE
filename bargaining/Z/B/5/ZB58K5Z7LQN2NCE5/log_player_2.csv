"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600,
""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts a time crunch on things, but your previous offer was too low for me.  This is a much fairer split.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her, taking advantage of the rapid devaluation of Bob's potential earnings.
* **Counter-offer:**  This offer still leans in Bob's favor, but is more reasonable. 
* **Time pressure:** Every round decreases the value of the money significantly, so Bob needs to incentivize Alice to accept quickly.  
* **Message:**  The message aims to be both firm and somewhat conciliatory, acknowledging the time pressure while making it clear Bob won't accept a heavily skewed deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the rapid decrease in value for you, this is a more generous offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** The inflation is hitting Bob hard. Waiting any longer significantly risks getting even less. 
* **Improved offer:** While still favoring Alice, her offer is closer to an even split, likely as a result of the time pressure she also faces.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in Round 4 is too risky. There's no guarantee Alice will offer more, and the potential loss from inflation outweighs the potential gain of a few hundred dollars."
