"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I think this is a fair split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I think this is a good starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. How about a 50/50 split? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50/50 is fair, considering the initial offer was 60/40. Can we meet in the middle at 55/45?""
}
```"

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the offers I've seen so far, I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my previous one, but I'm still not sure it's the best I can get. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
