"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take $6000, you take $4000. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against you, Bob. I'll take $5500, you take $4500. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\n### I'll accept this offer. The inflation is indeed working against me, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round. This way, I'll at least get $4500, which is better than potentially getting less in the future."
