"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60% for me, 40% for you 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think it's fairer if I get 60% since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer and losing money to inflation.  Let's split the difference.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You took a risk, but it didn't pay off. My share goes up! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm losing money each round with inflation.  Accepting is the best option at this point."
