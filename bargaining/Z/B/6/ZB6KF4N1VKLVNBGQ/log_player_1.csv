"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain would be worth 95% of $500,000, which is $475,000.

I don't think I should accept an offer that gives Bob a 22.2% larger share than me, especially since he rejected my initial 50-50 offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.
