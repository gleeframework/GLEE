**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is far from ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point.  Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The rapid 20% inflation rate means my potential gains are eroding significantly with each round. Waiting any longer will result in an even worse deal.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice seems content to wait me out, knowing that inflation works in her favor. She's unlikely to agree to a drastically better split.

Taking the $3,800 now is a better outcome than risking an even smaller amount in future rounds."
