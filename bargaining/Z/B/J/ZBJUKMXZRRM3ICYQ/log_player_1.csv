"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. This way, we both get a fair share, with you receiving a slightly smaller portion.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While this is a more even split than your previous offer, it reflects the fact that we're now in Round 2, and the value of the money is declining for me with each round. I'm hoping we can find a compromise here. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
