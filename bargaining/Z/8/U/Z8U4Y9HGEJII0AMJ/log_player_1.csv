"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, Bob's share is worth 10% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

Considering the offer, I'm willing to accept the compromise. I'll take the $4,000 and hope that Bob will be satisfied with his $6,000.
