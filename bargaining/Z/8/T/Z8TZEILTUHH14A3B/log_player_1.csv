  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, especially since it's worth less than my initial proposal. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

# Bob gain: 400000

# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I want to compromise at this point. While the 65/35 split is closer to what I was aiming for, I'm still not sure if it's the best deal I can get. I'll think carefully before making a decision.
