"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer aims to maximize my share while still being potentially acceptable to Bob. The significant difference in the split will likely lead to a counter-offer from Bob, but it sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see how he values the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is a fair split considering the inflation.  Accepting guarantees me at least half the remaining value, which is a better outcome than potentially losing more in future rounds."
