Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  I'm willing to take less, but I need a bigger share than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your offer. Let's split the difference this time. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to a more balanced offer, accepting now would still give her a significantly larger share. The inflation factor is working in Bob's favor, and it's worth risking another round to see if he can secure a better deal."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference again.  We're running out of time, but I think this is the fairest deal we can reach. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice for Bob at this point:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing significantly increases if Bob continues to reject Alice's offers.
* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation rate means each round makes the potential gains less valuable to Bob. Holding out for a slightly better offer in the later rounds might not be worth the risk of losing everything.
* **Alice's Concessions:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, moving closer to a 60/40 split.  It's unlikely she'll concede much more, especially with the time pressure.

This offer is not perfect, but it secures Bob a reasonable amount of money before inflation further diminishes his potential gains or they both lose everything."
