"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is getting worse, I still have time and she hasn't completely pushed me to the absolute lowest amount. I'll hold out a little longer and see if she gets desperate enough to offer something more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, I'm being patient 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is playing a tough game, but she's cutting it close.  I need to show I'm willing to risk it going to the end for a better deal. Accepting now would be too much of a loss."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side, you're losing value fast 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is getting dangerous, but Alice is getting greedy. She knows I'm feeling the pressure, but pushing below 40 is insulting.  I have to hold my nerve, there's a chance she panics if I reject this."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you win. This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.""}

**Reasoning:** It's a huge risk, but I need to signal that I'm serious about walking away. Offering anything less than 45 at this point would be pointless, she'd just smell desperation. This offer leaves her with a very good deal, and with only two rounds left, she might panic and take it rather than risk getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not bluffing, I'll take it all if you don't accept 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is brutal, but I have to call her bluff. Alice is clearly trying to intimidate me into taking a terrible deal. If she was really okay with us both getting nothing, she would have held firm in the earlier rounds.  By rejecting this, I'm betting that she'll panic in the final round and give me something I can actually work with. It's incredibly risky, but I don't have a better choice at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  We both lose if you reject. I'm taking the hit from inflation, but this is the best I can do.  Don't be greedy.""}

**Reasoning:** It's the final round, and I have to make a move. I'm betting that Alice will want to avoid getting nothing at all.  Offering her 60 is still a very favorable outcome for her, and it's the highest I can go while still having a chance of acceptance.  It's a last-ditch effort, but it's the only play I have left."
