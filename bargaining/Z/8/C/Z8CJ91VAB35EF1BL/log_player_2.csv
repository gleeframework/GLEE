"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. I take $700,000, you get $300,000.  Think about the decreasing value over time. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I think it's fairer to split the money more evenly.  I'll take $700,000, and you can have $300,000.  Let's not forget the money is worth less for me with each round, so this is a good deal for both of us.""}

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to offer you $400,000.  Remember, time is money, especially for you. This is a better deal than you'll get in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still hoping for a better deal.  While it's tempting to accept, I think I can still get a larger share. Let's see what happens in the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I won't accept less than $525,000. Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much better deal than I could get in the next round. It's time to accept."
