Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, but leaving a small amount for Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a very unequal split in the first round, or if he'll be more demanding later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like to get more,  the inflation is a serious threat.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, especially since I don't know how the inflation is affecting Bob.  I'll accept."
