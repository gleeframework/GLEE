"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, and I'll take the rest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both get a good amount this way! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not sure if it's the best option for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best option for me. I'd like to try to get a bit more.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept the even split just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a smaller amount than before, but I'm keeping the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to make it worth my while. This is my final offer before the inflation hits us harder. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob is trying to make a final offer before the inflation gets worse.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think this is a good compromise, considering the inflation. I'll take the 600,000 and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a fair compromise given the circumstances. The inflation has taken a significant toll on the value of the money, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round."
