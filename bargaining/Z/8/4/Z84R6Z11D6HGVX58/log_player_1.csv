"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 10% less, this offer is not as favorable to me as the initial 50/50 split. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In this round, I'll aim to get a better deal for myself. Since Bob's money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll try to compensate for that. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering a slightly biased split in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, this offer is actually more favorable to me than my initial 50/50 split. I'll accept this offer.
