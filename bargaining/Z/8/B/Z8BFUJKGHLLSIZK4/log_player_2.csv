"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's always worth exploring if a better deal is possible, especially since Alice's offer is not very generous.  Let's see if I can negotiate a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I believe a 70-30 split is fairer, reflecting the work I'm putting in to make this a win-win.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've compromised, 55-45 is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a higher share, Alice's offer is significantly better than my previous proposal and it seems she's unlikely to budge further. Accepting this offer guarantees a good outcome for me, and  continuing to reject could lead to a situation where both of us end up with less money."
