"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much!""
}
```

This is a fair and straightforward offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I should accept this offer. I'd rather negotiate further to get a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so now it's worth 95% of the original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still reasonable considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 35, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I think I should accept this offer. It's not a great deal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking getting an even worse offer in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
