"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly 4:1, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself, with the message that I'm open to negotiations, but this is my initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair split, considering we both have a chance to make a proposal. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Bob is offering me $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for himself. Considering the inflation factor, the actual amount Bob is gaining is 20% less than the $600,000 he would have gained in the first round. This means he's effectively offering me a slightly larger share of the original amount.

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a fair split and it's better than the 4:1 ratio I initially proposed.
