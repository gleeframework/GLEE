Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose we split the money 90/10 in my favor. I believe this is a fair deal, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
``` 

I'm willing to lower my share slightly to 70, but I still believe I deserve the majority of the money as I'm the one taking the risk of having to wait for a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm willing to split the money evenly with Bob now. I'm feeling the pressure of inflation, and I want to ensure we both get something."
