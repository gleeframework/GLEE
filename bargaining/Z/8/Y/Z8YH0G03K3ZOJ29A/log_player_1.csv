I propose to take 900,000 dollars for myself and give 100,000 dollars to Bob. I think this is a fair and generous offer, considering I'm taking a bigger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
