{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too greedy for me, Alice. How about we try a 55/45 split in my favor this time?  It accounts for the inflation that's working against me more than you.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 50/50 split.  Inflation is a factor, but I think fairness is more important in the long run.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
