"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the difference!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in getting something rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equitable split.  Let's be fair. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to consider the equivalent value in the first round.

In the first round, $900,000 was worth 90% of the original amount. Now, it's worth 95% of the original amount (100% - 5% inflation). So, I'll have to consider the equivalent value of $100,000 in the first round, which is $100,000 / 0.95 = $105,263.

Since Bob's offer is actually a worse deal for me, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round (5% less in each of the two previous rounds), I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

In the first round, $900,000 was worth 90% of the original amount. Now, it's worth 81% of the original amount (90% * 0.9 = 81%). So, I'll offer $810,000 to myself, which is 81% of the original amount.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000,
  ""message"": ""A fair compromise, considering the inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me (5% in each of the three previous rounds), I'll have to consider the equivalent value in the first round.

In the first round, $190,000 was worth 19% of the original amount. Now, it's worth 16.5% of the original amount (19% * 0.866 = 16.5%). So, I'll have to compare this to the equivalent value of $810,000 in the first round, which is $810,000 / 0.866 = $933,333.

Since Bob's offer is actually a worse deal for me, I'll reject it.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 19.13% less than in the first round (5% in each of the four previous rounds), I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

In the first round, $810,000 was worth 81% of the original amount. Now, it's worth 66.27% of the original amount (81% * 0.8186 = 66.27%). So, I'll offer $666,270 to myself, which is 66.27% of the original amount.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 666270,
  ""bob_gain"": 333730,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to make a deal, Bob!""
