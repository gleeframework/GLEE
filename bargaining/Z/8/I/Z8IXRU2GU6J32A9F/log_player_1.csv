"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. I'll get the bigger share this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll get $600,000 and Bob will get $400,000. I'm framing it as a generous offer, suggesting that I'll get the bigger share this time, but leaving the door open for a more even split in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but still fair. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

My gain: 300,000 x 0.8 = 240,000
Bob's gain: 700,000 x 0.9 = 630,000

I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but it's still a better offer than the first round. I'll accept this offer.
