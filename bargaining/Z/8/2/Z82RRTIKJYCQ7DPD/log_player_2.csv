# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd rather try to get a better offer than accept 30 dollars right off the bat! The money's not worth that much less yet.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! I'm looking forward to making the next proposal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. This is a fair deal, let's close it.

# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not going to accept an offer that's not much better than the first one, especially since the money is worth less now. I'll try to get a better deal or make a counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! The game is heating up!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll try to take into account the decreasing value of the money and make an offer that's still reasonable, but also takes into account the time pressure.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, the value is decreasing fast! Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice! Time is of the essence!"
