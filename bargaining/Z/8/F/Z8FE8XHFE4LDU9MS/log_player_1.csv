"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 30, you can have 70. It's a decent split, and we can still play more rounds if you want. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
