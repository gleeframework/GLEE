"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original 100$ and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving up much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. 

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering a slightly better deal than my initial offer, I'll consider accepting. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
