Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is laughable. I'm feeling generous, so here's a counter-offer. Don't forget, time is money - and it's depreciating fast! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
