{""bob_gain"": 700000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. A 50/50 split is fair, considering the inflation.  Accept this and we can both walk away with a decent sum. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
