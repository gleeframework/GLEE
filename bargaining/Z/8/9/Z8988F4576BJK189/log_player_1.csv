"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I'm taking a risk by proposing a very uneven split in my favor. This is based on the following strategy:

* **High Stakes:**  I'm aiming to secure a large portion of the money quickly, as the value of the money diminishes with each round.
* **Potential for Bob's Greed:** Bob might be tempted to accept this offer, hoping to get something rather than nothing if he rejects it.

However, this strategy is risky. Bob could be more risk-averse and reject the offer, putting me at a disadvantage in the next round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer gives me a small amount, it's significantly less than what I offered him in the previous round.  I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially considering the inflation factor.  By rejecting this offer, I maintain my position to propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Explanation:**

This round is crucial.  I'm adjusting my strategy based on Bob's previous actions:

* **Bob's Greed:** He rejected my generous offer, showing a desire for a larger share.
* **Inflation:** My money is worth less, so I need to aim for a higher share to compensate.

This offer still gives Bob a significant share (400,000), but it's a better balance than my previous offer.  It also acknowledges the inflation factor, making it a more appealing proposition than Bob's last offer."
