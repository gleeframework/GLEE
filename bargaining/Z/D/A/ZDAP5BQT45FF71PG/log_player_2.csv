Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to offset the inflation.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  I've moved closer to your position, but this is my final offer.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close, Bob. This is my final offer. If we don't agree now, the inflation will hurt us both. Let's make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 secures a reasonable amount before inflation further eats into potential gains. Waiting any longer risks a worse offer or even reaching no deal at all."
