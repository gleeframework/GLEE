"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. It's a relatively balanced split, but I'm taking a slightly larger share to start. Let's see if Bob accepts or rejects!"
