"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000, and I'll take the rest. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and leaves Bob with 40%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and Bob will try to do better next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, as we both get a decent amount. Let's end this here. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth 90% of the original amount, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 95% of the original amount.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than a 45% split. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is too skewed towards you. I'll make a new offer: 475,000 for me, and 525,000 for you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain of $475,000 is now worth 81% of the original amount, and Bob's gain of $525,000 is worth 85% of the original amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be more generous, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation. You'll get a bit more than before.""
}
```"
