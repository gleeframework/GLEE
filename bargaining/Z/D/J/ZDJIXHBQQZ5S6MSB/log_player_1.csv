"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less.

I'm not happy with this offer, as it's not as favorable to me as my original proposal. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll aim for a better split this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer from Bob for Round 4.

Since the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the equivalent value of his gain in the first round. Assuming the initial value of Bob's gain was $400,000 (from Round 1), the equivalent value in Round 4 would be:

$400,000 / (1 - 0.488) = $400,000 / 0.512 = $781,250

Now, considering the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, my gain is still $600,000.

I'll compare the ratio of my gain to Bob's gain in the first round (60:40) to the ratio in Bob's offer for Round 4 (450:550). The ratio in Bob's offer is 45:55, which is more favorable to me.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4.
