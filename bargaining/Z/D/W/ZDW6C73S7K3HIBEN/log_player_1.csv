Let's see if Bob takes the majority of the money. I'm feeling generous, but it's important to remember that the money loses value each round.  ðŸ˜œ"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd love to get more, I realize that in the next round, the money I gain will be worth even less. It's better to take the 600,000 now, even if it feels like a little less than I ""deserve."""
