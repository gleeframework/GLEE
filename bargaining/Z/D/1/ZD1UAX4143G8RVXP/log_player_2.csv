"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you a good chunk of the money, and we can avoid the inflation risks. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not sure if I want to agree to this. I think I can get more in future rounds. I will try to negotiate a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need more for myself to make it worthwhile. Let's see if we can find a compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  Inflation is hurting both of us, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to move forward. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's do it.  Inflation is a real threat, and a 50/50 split is the safest way to ensure we both get something."
