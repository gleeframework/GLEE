"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm aiming for a fair but slightly advantageous deal, as the first proposer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for inflation. My share is slightly lower than before, but still leaves a considerable amount for myself, while giving Bob a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is less than I initially wanted, due to inflation, the money I gain is worth significantly less than in previous rounds. Accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount, and further rounds will only continue to devalue my earnings."
