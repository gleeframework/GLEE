"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I want to secure a large portion of the money while leaving Bob with something to consider. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, and the next round might be even worse for me.  It's better to take what I can get now."
