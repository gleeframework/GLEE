Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on the last offer, but I still want a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the devaluation of the money is significant. It's in my best interest to hold out for a better offer, as accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential value compared to the initial rounds."
