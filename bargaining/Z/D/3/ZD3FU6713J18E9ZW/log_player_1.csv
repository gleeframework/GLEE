"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'm not as keen on giving him a larger share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 55 for him and 45 for me, I'll try to adjust my offer to be slightly more favorable to myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 47,
  ""bob_gain"": 53
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less for both of us now, but Bob's offer is still quite generous. I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is 60 for him and 40 for me, and considering that the money is worth less for both of us, I'll decide to accept this offer.
