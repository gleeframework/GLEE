"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, but I'm open to negotiations 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think it's a reasonable offer, and I'm willing to accept it. After all, we are meeting in the middle, and I'm open to negotiations. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
