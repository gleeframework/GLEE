"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20 to start, you can try to do better next round!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 60/40, can you do better than this? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is actually worth 80% of what it was in the previous round. Since Bob's gain of $4,000 remains the same, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to do better next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""You offered 60/40, I'll counter with 75/25. Can you do better than this?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the current $8,000 (80% of the original $10,000), which is $6,000, and Bob gets 25%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try 50/50, can we finally agree on this? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth 40% of what it was in the first round. Since Bob's gain of $5,000 remains the same, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

However, I think it's a good idea to accept this offer since it's a 50/50 split, which is a relatively fair division. I'll take the risk that the inflation might not be as severe as I expect.
