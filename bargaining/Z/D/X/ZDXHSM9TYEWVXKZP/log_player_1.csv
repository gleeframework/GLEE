"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 30%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 80% of the original $500,000 (since the original $1,000,000 is now worth $800,000 due to inflation).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me again, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, again""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $800,000 (after two rounds of inflation), leaving Bob with 45%. I'm hoping this offer is more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lower half this time 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $450,000, which is worth 56.25% of the original $800,000 (since the original $1,000,000 is now worth $625,000 due to inflation).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:
