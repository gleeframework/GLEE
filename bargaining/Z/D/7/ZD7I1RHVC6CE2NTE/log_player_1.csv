"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 600,000 dollars, leaving 400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.95 = 427,500
Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.95 = 522,500

I'll accept this offer.
