"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'll gain $200,000 and Bob will gain $800,000. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, he's effectively getting $760,000 in real value.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up so much, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
