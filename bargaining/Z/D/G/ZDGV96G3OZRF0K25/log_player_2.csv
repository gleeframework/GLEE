"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money with a 3:1 ratio. I'll take 75$, you take 25$. It's fair considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.

# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you take 40. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation rate.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we split the money with an even greater gap. I'll take 80$, you take 20$. This maintains the diminishing value of money for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'll take 40, you take 60. It's a more balanced split considering the increasing gap due to inflation, and it's still better than the 20% I would get if we continue to the next round.""}"
