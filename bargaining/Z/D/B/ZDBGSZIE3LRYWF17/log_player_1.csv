"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I don't want to risk going to the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
