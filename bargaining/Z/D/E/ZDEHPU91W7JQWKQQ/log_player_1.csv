"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than 50% of the total. Bob's offer is 40% to 60%, which is not as favorable to me as my original offer.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob rejected my initial offer and his subsequent offer was not as favorable to me, I'll try to make a new offer that's more in my favor. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain still worth the same as in the first round, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation affecting Bob's side. His offer is still a 48/52 split, which is closer to the initial 50/50 split I proposed, but still not as favorable to me as I'd like.

I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since Bob's offer is still not as good as my original offer, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer from the previous round was not as favorable to me as my original offer, and considering the increasing inflation affecting Bob's side, I'll try to make a new offer that's even more in my favor.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm aiming for a 60/40 split, which is more favorable to me considering the inflation's effect on Bob's side."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to take its toll on Bob's side. His offer is now a 52/48 split, which is closer to my original 50/50 proposal, but still not as favorable to me as my previous offers.

Considering the significant inflation affecting Bob's side, I think this offer is the best I can get from him at this point. I'll accept his offer.
