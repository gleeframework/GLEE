"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'll give you a decent amount too. This way, I'll get a bigger piece of the pie, but you'll still get something. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
