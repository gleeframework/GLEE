,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's be a little more fair this time. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a good starting point, and we can adjust from here if needed.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5700.0,4300.0,"Considering the inflation, I've adjusted my proposal to a 57/43 split in favor of Alice. I believe this is a fair compromise given the diminishing value of money with each round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4700.0,5300.0,"I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'd like a slightly bigger share. Let's go with a 53/47 split. This way we both get a decent share of the diminishing value of the money.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5400.0,4600.0,I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. My counteroffer is a 54/46 split in favor of Alice. I think this is a reasonable adjustment considering the inflation rate and our goal to maximize our gains.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4900.0,5100.0,Let's split it 51/49 in my favor. I think this is a fair compromise given the inflation and the fact that we're nearing the halfway point of the game. It's time to be more flexible.,Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5200.0,4800.0,I understand your position and the need for flexibility. My proposal is a 52/48 split in favor of Alice. I believe this offers a balanced compromise while still maximizing our individual gains within the constraints of inflation.,Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Time to be practical. Given the rapid inflation, I propose we split the money 50/50. It's the fairest option at this point, and we can both walk away with something.  Let's avoid the risk of getting nothing.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,accept
