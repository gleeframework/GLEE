{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $5000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation rate is higher for you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but considering the inflation rate is higher for me, I'll think it over.

After some consideration, I'll make a counteroffer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

I'm adjusting the split to 55/45 in my favor, hoping Bob will find it more acceptable."
