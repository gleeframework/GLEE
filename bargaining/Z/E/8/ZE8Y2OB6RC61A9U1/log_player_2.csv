Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected the 50-50 split, I'll try to get a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Taking into account the inflation, I'll consider the effective value of the money. Since the money I gain is worth 36% less, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the loss. However, Alice's offer seems reasonable considering the reduced value of the money.
