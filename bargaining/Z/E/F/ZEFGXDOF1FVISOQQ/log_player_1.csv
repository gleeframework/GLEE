"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $2,500. I believe this is fair given the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 3:2 ratio, considering the initial offer was too skewed in your favor. This way, we both share the risk of inflation more equally. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
