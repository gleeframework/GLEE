"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,

  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio. I take $7500 and Bob takes $2500. This seems fair considering the risk and potential loss due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced ratio is fair, considering the risk of inflation is still high, but not as high as before. This way, we both take a hit, but it's more evenly distributed. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
