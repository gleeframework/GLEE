"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm hoping Bob will want to negotiate and I can get a better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as eager to give up as much. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to accept a smaller share now that the money is worth less."
