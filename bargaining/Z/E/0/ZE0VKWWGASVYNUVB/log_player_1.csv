"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a relatively generous split, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm keeping most of the money. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 25-75 split, especially considering the money is worth 20% less than it was in the first round. I'm hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly better split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still in control here. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Considering Bob's new offer, I've decided to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 35-65 split, especially since the money is worth significantly less than it was in the first round. I'll try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

Considering the rapid decrease in the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly better split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, it's getting desperate""
}
```

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway and propose a 50-50 split, hoping he'll see the value in this offer and accept it."
