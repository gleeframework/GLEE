"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this is a fair split. Since the value of money decreases by 20% for me with each round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly, but I also don't want to give away too much. Let's see how Bob reacts!\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I initially offered a 60-40 split in my favor and Bob rejected it, it's no surprise that Bob has now offered a split that is more favorable to him. However, considering the impact of inflation on my share, I need to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential for further decreases in value if we continue negotiating.\n\n###\n\nGiven that Bob's offer of $45 for me is closer to an even split than I initially offered, and taking into account the 20% decrease in value for my share if we continue, I think it's reasonable to accept this offer. It ensures I receive a significant portion of the money now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome!"
