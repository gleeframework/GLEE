"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, taking 90% of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not happy with only 20% of the money, it's better than getting nothing in the end. Inflation is working against me, and it's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the future rounds."
