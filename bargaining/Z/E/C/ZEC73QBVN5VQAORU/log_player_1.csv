"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, my gain of $7,000 is actually worth 90% of the original $8,000 I proposed in Round 1, which is $7,200. And Bob's gain of $3,000 is actually worth 85% of the original $2,000 he would have gotten in Round 1, which is $1,650.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
