Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm taking a slightly greedy approach here. I figure I'm likely to be able to get a better offer from Bob, so I'm offering him the minimum possible share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and it's better than the risk of getting a worse offer in the next round."
