"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount to start, leaving me with $8,000. I'm hoping this will give me an advantage in future rounds due to the inflation effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. We can both get a good amount if we split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $4,750.

I don't think this is a good deal for me, since I'd be giving up $1,250 of my potential gain. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is worth 90.25% of its original value now ($4,750).

I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You said we could split it evenly, but I think I'm worth more than you right now. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're losing money with each round. Let's compromise. This is a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at my potential gain quickly! With the current inflation rate, my gain of $6,000 in round 3 is now worth 85.74% of its original value, which is $5,144.40.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a relatively fair deal, especially since the inflation is making my gains worth less and less each round. I'd rather accept this offer and get a guaranteed $5,500 than risk losing more value in future rounds.
