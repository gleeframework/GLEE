"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair starting point, Bob. Let's not let inflation eat away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's proposal is a decent starting point, it's important to consider the impact of inflation. Rejecting the offer gives me the opportunity to propose a more favorable split in the next round, potentially gaining more than 4000 after the inflation discount is applied."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to avoid any potential losses from inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle a bit. This offer still gives you a sizable share, and we both benefit from settling sooner. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a slightly larger share than the initial round, the 36% inflation discount on my gains makes this offer less attractive than her first proposal.  I'll continue to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Let's get this done.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth is costing us both.  I'm dropping my offer slightly again to show I'm serious about settling. Let's end this before inflation eats further into our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While the inflation is taking a significant toll on my gains, Alice's offer is the highest I've received so far, and it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. The chance of getting a better deal later is diminishing with each round, and it's better to accept a reasonable offer now than risk getting nothing at all."
