This offer is incredibly unfair, and with 12 rounds to go, there's plenty of time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is much fairer than the previous ones. It's a 50/50 split and while the money is worth less due to inflation, it's still a decent amount.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the future, so accepting this is the most logical choice."
