"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's start with 5500 for me and 4500 for you.  This way we both get a decent share, and we can adjust it further in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
