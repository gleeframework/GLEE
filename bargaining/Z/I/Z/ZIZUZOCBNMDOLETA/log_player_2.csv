Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

The game is heavily rigged against Bob due to the rapid inflation.  While Alice is correct that Bob's potential gains are diminishing, she's using that to her advantage to propose increasingly unfair splits.  It's worth the risk of going another round to try and negotiate a better deal, even if it means getting a smaller portion of a shrinking pie."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Accept it, or we both get nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a high-stakes gamble, but it's time to force Alice's hand.  By Round 7, the effects of inflation will be even more severe.  This offer:

* **Is still technically in Alice's favor:**  She's getting more than what Bob previously offered.
* **Creates a sense of urgency:** The ""final offer"" wording implies there's no more negotiating.
* **Introduces a consequence for Alice:** If she rejects this, there's a real chance Bob will refuse to cooperate further, leaving both with nothing. 

This strategy aims to exploit Alice's likely assumption that Bob is getting increasingly desperate. By appearing strong and decisive, there's a chance to swing the power dynamic and secure a somewhat reasonable deal."
