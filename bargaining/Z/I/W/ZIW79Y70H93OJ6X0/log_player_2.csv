**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but she's still offering less than a 50/50 split.  While the value of the deal is going down, I'm willing to gamble that she'll crack under pressure before I do.  We're nearing the halfway point, so the next few rounds are critical."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. I'm offering a very small advantage to me, acknowledging you started this negotiation with a higher initial value. Take it or we both lose out.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're past the halfway point, and Alice needs to understand the urgency. This offer is designed to appeal to her sense of fairness (she did start with a higher initial offer) while still giving me a slight edge. The message is direct and conveys the seriousness of the situation."
