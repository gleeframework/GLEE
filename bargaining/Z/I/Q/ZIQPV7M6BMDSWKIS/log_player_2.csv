"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This seems like a fair starting point, Bob. Slightly more for me since I'm taking the first risk, but plenty for you too. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  The risk of inflation is a factor, but I'm willing to take a chance in hopes of getting a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split the difference and see where we land.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's stop wasting time and take the most logical approach.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still like a slightly larger share, it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  The 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point to avoid losing money to inflation."
