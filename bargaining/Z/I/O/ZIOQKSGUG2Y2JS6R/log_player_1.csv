Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65/35 split is more fair considering the inflation rates.  This gives us both a good chunk of the money while accounting for the fact that your money is losing value faster. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000
