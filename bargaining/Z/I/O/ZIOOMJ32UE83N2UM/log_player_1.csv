"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference to test the waters""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a small difference to see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for Bob, so the offer is actually:

```
# Alice gain: 6000
# Bob gain: 3600
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
