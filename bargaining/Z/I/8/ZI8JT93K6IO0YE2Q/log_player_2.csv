"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small share and let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a terrible deal for Bob.  While it's tempting to take something, the potential gains from waiting are much higher."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. I'm offering you a decent share, but I need to make sure I get a good deal as well. This is a better deal than the last round, and we can end this game."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a good deal, Bob, but I'm still the one losing more to inflation. Let's compromise, and I'll take a smaller cut this time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's share is worth significantly less due to inflation, this is a much better offer than the previous round. It's likely that Alice will continue to lower her share in subsequent rounds, making this the best option for Bob at this point."
