Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'll give you a little more. But let's try to be reasonable here. We don't want to lose everything! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI can still try to get a better deal! The inflation isn't too bad yet, and I think I can squeeze a bit more out of Alice. Bring on the next round!"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be smart. We're losing money with each round. Splitting evenly is the best way to make sure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think it's time to accept the offer. With the inflation, we're losing a significant amount of value with each round, and Alice's offer to split evenly is starting to look like the best option. If I reject this offer, I risk losing even more value in the next round, and I might not get a better deal. Time to be pragmatic and take the 50-50 split!"
