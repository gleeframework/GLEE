"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still allows Bob to get a small portion, incentivizing him to potentially accept.  It's a high-risk, high-reward move, but it leaves room for negotiation if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred more, this offer is still very favorable to me, especially considering the inflation affecting Bob.  Accepting this deal secures a significant amount of money, and further negotiation might not be worth the risk of getting nothing in the end."
