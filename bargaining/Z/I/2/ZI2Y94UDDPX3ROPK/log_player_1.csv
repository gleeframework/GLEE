Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take the vast majority of the money.  Since the money inflates for me but not for Bob, I'll try to get as much as I can quickly.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer.  The money is rapidly losing value for me, and even though Bob took a lot of money, I'm losing even more by refusing his offer!"
