Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to adjust for inflation, but I still think we can find a better balance. This is my revised offer. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging the pressure of inflation, the deal is still not favorable enough for me.  I'm aiming for a near-even split, especially with the increasing impact of inflation on her share. I'll push a little harder in the next round."
