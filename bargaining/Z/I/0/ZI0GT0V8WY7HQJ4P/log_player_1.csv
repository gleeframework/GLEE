I'm going for a very aggressive first offer. Since I have 12 rounds and the money depreciates with each round, I want to get the most I can as quickly as possible.  I'll keep an eye on Bob's response and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to have more, it's better to take the 500,000 now. The inflation is a significant risk, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round.  It's time to secure what I can."
