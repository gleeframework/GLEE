It's a good starting point, but I'm going to try to get a better deal since I know the money is going to be worth less for Alice in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think it's more fair to split it down the middle, especially since you'll lose value on your share in the next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm still going to reject. Even with the inflation, I can still do better than 48$ by taking the lead in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but I'm still holding out for a more equal split. Let's work together to reach a fair agreement before the inflation hits us both too hard.""}
