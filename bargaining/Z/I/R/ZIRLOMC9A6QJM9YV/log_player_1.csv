"Round 1

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a decent share while still allowing me to secure the majority. I'll be interested to see if he accepts this or wants to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, and I'm confident I can do better. I'll reject this and see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750}
```

I'm going to stick with a split in my favor, but I'll reduce my share slightly to 5250, acknowledging the inflation and Bob's previous proposal. This should be a good compromise, giving Bob more than his previous offer while still securing a majority for me."
