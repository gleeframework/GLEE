"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going to try to get as much of the money as possible in the first round, before inflation kicks in.  I'm offering Bob $1, knowing he'll likely reject it, but it sets a precedent for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, accepting this offer guarantees me $500,000. Given the inflation, waiting for another round is risky, as my share could be significantly reduced."
