"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to secure a deal quickly due to the higher inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer, as I believe I can get a better deal despite the inflation penalty."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more balanced offer. It's better for both of us to agree sooner rather than later.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and the value is eroding quickly. I'm proposing a slightly improved offer for you to consider.  Let's secure a deal before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the value is eroding, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal considering Alice also loses value with each round. I'll proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the increasing loss of value, it's in both our interests to finalize this soon. I've adjusted my offer slightly to reflect the urgency.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing your reluctance, but we're running out of time. This is my final offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the circumstances. Let's be done with this! 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant erosion of value for me and the fact that Alice's offer hasn't decreased as much, I think it's wise to accept this offer before the value drops even further. Continuing to negotiate risks leaving both of us with nothing."
