Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to account for the greater impact of inflation on my side. Let's find a middle ground, or we both risk losing more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the higher inflation rate, but her concessions are still too small.  While it's tempting to accept a 40/60 split, the longer this goes on, the more I'm favored. I need to push for a better deal, but time is running out."
