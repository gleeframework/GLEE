**Explanation:**

While the offer is not ideal, considering the inflation, it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. 

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value rapidly, and it's likely to continue doing so.  
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice seems to be strategically offering slightly more each round, likely hoping you'll accept out of fear of getting less in future rounds. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential Future Offers:** There's no guarantee that Alice will continue offering increasing amounts. She could offer you a much smaller share in the next round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While 271,000 is significantly less than the initial 900,000, it's still a substantial amount, especially considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing if Alice doesn't offer anything in the next round. 

**Conclusion:** Accepting this offer is the best strategy for Bob in this scenario, considering the inflation and the potential for further losses."
