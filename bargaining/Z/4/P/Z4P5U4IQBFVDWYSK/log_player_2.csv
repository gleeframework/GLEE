"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fairer deal that accounts for the time lost in negotiation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and negotiation time, I propose a 55:45 split in favor of Bob. This balances fairness and efficiency. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's a better deal than my previous proposal, and considering the inflation, it's probably the best I'm going to get."
