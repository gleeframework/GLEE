"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate and the money will be worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 30 is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better than that.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 30, I think I can do a bit better. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55 is a more reasonable starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my original offer, but still takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think 35 is a good middle ground 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm getting closer to accepting. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm willing to consider a slightly lower offer. However, I'm not ready to give up just yet.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 35, I think I can do a bit better. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I think 50/50 is a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
