60.0,40.0,"Let's be fair and split the money, Bob.  I propose I take $60 and you take $40. This way we both benefit from this game. What do you say?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable, I'll take $55 and you get $45.  This accounts for the time value of money, since I'm taking on more risk.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but my initial offer was already accounting for the time value. Let's meet in the middle - I'll take $55, you take $45. It's a fair compromise.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, it seems like we're at an impasse.  Let's be practical - I'll accept $60, leaving you with $40.  This is my final offer, take it or leave it.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split the money evenly, $50 for each of us.  It's clear we both want to benefit, and this is the fairest solution. Don't let greed make us lose everything.",Alice,5,
