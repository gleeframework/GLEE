"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money, Bob.  I propose I take $60 and you take $40. This way we both benefit from this game. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable, I'll take $55 and you get $45.  This accounts for the time value of money, since I'm taking on more risk.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a good deal, but my initial offer was already accounting for the time value. Let's meet in the middle - I'll take $55, you take $45. It's a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to disguise her previous offer as a compromise.  While the nominal amounts are swapped, the time value of money means this offer is even worse for me than her first one. I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share or she'll keep lowballing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, it seems like we're at an impasse.  Let's be practical - I'll accept $60, leaving you with $40.  This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and Alice doesn't seem to grasp the impact of inflation on her potential gains. This offer is my best chance to secure a reasonable amount. By presenting it as a final offer, I'm hoping to incentivize Alice to accept before her position weakens further due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split the money evenly, $50 for each of us.  It's clear we both want to benefit, and this is the fairest solution. Don't let greed make us lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice is finally making a reasonable offer.  The impact of inflation is significant at this point, and waiting any longer drastically increases the risk of both of us walking away with nothing. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
