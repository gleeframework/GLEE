"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I'll get are:

* Alice gain: 45 * 0.95 = 42.75
* Bob gain: 55 * 0.95 = 52.25

I'll reject this offer. The difference between our proposed gains is not significant enough to warrant accepting this offer. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my previous offer, I'll make a new proposal. This time, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the reduced value of money due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and Bob gets the remaining 45%, which is $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up quickly!

Considering Bob's new offer, the actual amounts I'll get are:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.8574 (1 - 0.1426) = 42.87
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.8574 = 42.87

Since we're now at a 50-50 split, and the amounts are relatively close, I'll accept this offer. It's a fair division, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values.
