"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, and inviting Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll have to decide whether the trade-off is worth it.

After considering it, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of rejection.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give myself a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'll give you a bit more, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'll have to weigh the trade-off carefully.

After considering it, I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
