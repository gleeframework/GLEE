Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

}

I'm starting with a fair and simple offer, hoping Bob will accept it!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to weigh the benefits. I'll have to make a decision based on the current value of the money, not the original amount.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 300,000 is a fair compromise, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll try to negotiate further."
