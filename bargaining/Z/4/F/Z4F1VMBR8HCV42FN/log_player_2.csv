"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you still get something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a very unfair offer!  While it's true that the money will decrease in value, I can try to negotiate for a better deal.  Let's see if I can get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly.  I propose a 45/55 split in my favor, as I'm losing more value each round.  This is a good starting point for a fair and mutually beneficial agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get more than your last offer.  Let's split it 60/40. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice is getting closer to a more fair offer, I'm still losing too much. I need to try and get a better deal before the inflation eats away at my share further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly.  This is the fairest option, and it's important to remember that we both lose value with each passing round.  Let's end this now and avoid further losses.""}
