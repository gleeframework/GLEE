"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. The message ""Let's be fair"" suggests that the division is somewhat equitable, considering we both get a significant portion of the money, but I get a bit more to account for the fact that the value of money decreases more for me with each round. This initial offer sets a baseline for negotiations, giving Bob the option to accept, decline, or counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share is worth more this round, Alice. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his claim that my share is worth more this round, the actual value of the money I would receive ($45) is less than what I initially proposed for myself ($60) and does not compensate for the 10% decrease in value due to inflation. Additionally, Bob's gain ($55) is more than what I initially offered him ($40), which doesn't seem like a better deal for me considering the inflation impact. Rejecting this offer gives me the opportunity to propose a new division in the next round that might better account for the decreasing value of money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose that I receive $58 and Bob receives $42. The message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust"" acknowledges that the value of money has decreased for both of us, but more so for me. This offer is a slight adjustment from my initial proposal, giving me a bit less than the original $60 to show willingness to compromise, while also not going as low as Bob's offer of $45 for me in the previous round. It's an attempt to find a middle ground that recognizes the impact of inflation on both our potential gains."
