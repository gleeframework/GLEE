I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a small share.  This is to hopefully secure a quick agreement and avoid the risk of inflation."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my previous proposal, and while inflation hurts, it's not enough to make this deal worthwhile. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

# Alice gain: 3500

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While the inflation is taking a toll, I still believe I can get a better deal than this.  Bob's offers keep getting worse, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small share.  I'll keep pushing for a more equitable split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm reducing my share further, but still trying to maintain a majority. With only a few rounds left, it's crucial to find a solution that is somewhat acceptable to both of us.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize the risk of getting nothing and be willing to compromise."

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  I'm not going to settle for such a small share, especially with the risk of getting nothing looming.
