900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can adjust later if you think it's too uneven.,Alice,1,

600000.0,400000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is still too lopsided. Let's try 60/40. Remember, the inflation will affect you more, so it's in your best interest to agree now.",Alice,3,
