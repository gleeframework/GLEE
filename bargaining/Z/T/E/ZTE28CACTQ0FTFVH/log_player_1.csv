Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a more fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
