"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This is a very lopsided offer, and even though the money is worth less in the next round, Bob has nothing to lose by rejecting and getting to propose a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
 
This is a 50/50 split.  Bob has no reason to believe Alice will be more favorable in the future given the inflation, so this offer is the most logical."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Even though Bob's share is worth less due to inflation, Alice's offer is still unfavorable. It's better to continue playing and potentially get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000}
```

Bob is trying to get closer to a 50/50 split, but given the inflation and Alice's previous rejection, a slightly more generous offer to Alice is needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a good deal for Bob, considering the inflation rate and the fact that Alice is making a more reasonable offer. The offer is close to a 50/50 split, which is what Bob initially wanted.  While it's worth slightly less in today's value, the risk of further inflation is too high.  It's best to accept and secure this share."
