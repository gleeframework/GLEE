"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, but remember, the money shrinks with each round! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes next!  While 1000$ is something, I think I can get a better deal if we keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split the money a little closer to even. It's in both of our best interests to come to an agreement before the value of the money dwindles too much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's find a middle ground before we lose too much more. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a much better deal than my last offer.  Let's take it!  It's getting risky to keep playing."
