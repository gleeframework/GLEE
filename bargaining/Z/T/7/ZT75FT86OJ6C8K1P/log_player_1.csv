"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to give Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering the inflation factor. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth 10% less for me, so the actual amount I would gain is $56 (60% of $100 x 0.9).

I'll accept Bob's offer.
