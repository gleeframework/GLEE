"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate is higher for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's a bit too early to accept such a large disparity. I want to see how the inflation plays out and if I can get a better deal in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Alice. We can adjust later if needed.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need a bit more to account for the inflation. This offer is still fair. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still hoping for a better deal. The inflation is starting to affect us both, and I think I can get closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Alice, with the inflation impacting us both, we need to find a compromise. This offer is closer to a fair split, considering our individual inflation rates.""
