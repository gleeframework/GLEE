"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money, but you get a good start. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's risky to accept such a small portion at the beginning.  I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split. We both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about losing too much to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is better than the previous round. While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this proposal is the best way to secure some of the money before inflation eats away more of our potential gains."
