"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his gain of 6000 is actually equivalent to 6000 / 0.8 = 7500 in the first round. This is a significant increase for him.

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was 4000 for me and 6000 for him, and the money is worth 20% less for him, I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes this into account. I'll aim for a higher share for myself, but not so high that Bob will reject it.

Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for Bob, his gain of 5200 is actually equivalent to 5200 / (1 - 0.488) = 5200 / 0.512 = 10159.06 in the first round. This is a very high offer for him.

I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering that Bob's offer in the previous round was extremely high, I'll aim for a more balanced offer this time. Since the money is worth the same for me, I'll try to get a higher share.

Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round. Since the money is worth 67.23% less for Bob, his gain of 4800 is actually equivalent to 4800 / (1 - 0.6723) = 4800 / 0.3277 = 14651.49 in the first round. This is a very high offer for him.

However, considering the value of his offer in the first round, I think he's trying to make up for the loss in value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
