4000.0,6000.0,Your offer was quite unfair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's be reasonable and avoid letting the money shrink further.,Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I understand you want a larger share, but a 60/40 split is still too lopsided.  I'm willing to compromise with a 55/45 split. This is a fairer offer and avoids further losses due to inflation. What do you say?",Alice,3,

4800.0,5200.0,"Alice, we're getting close, but time is running out. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor.  It's a slight improvement from your offer, and it allows us both to get a decent share before inflation eats away at it.",Bob,4,
