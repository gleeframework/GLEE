"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice, the total value is now 900,000$ for me and 800,000$ for Alice.

Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 1, the total value was $1,000,000. Now, due to inflation, the total value is worth 64% of the original amount, which is $640,000.

For me, the money is worth 19% less than in the first round, so I gain $300,000 * 0.81 = $243,000.
For Alice, the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, so she gains $700,000 * 0.64 = $448,000.

Considering my share in Alice's offer, I would gain $500,000, which is more than my calculated value of $243,000.

I accept Alice's offer.
