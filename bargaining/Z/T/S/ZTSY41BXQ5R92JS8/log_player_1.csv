"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already starting to bite!

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less, I want to get a bigger share to make up for it. However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk going into further rounds.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
