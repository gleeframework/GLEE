"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'll offer Bob a small portion, hoping he'll accept in the first round to avoid any potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Even though Bob is offering me more than in the previous round, I am confident that I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate.  The inflation will hurt Bob more than it hurts me in the next round, giving me more leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller amount than before, knowing that the inflation will further decrease the value of the offer for him. This should incentivize him to accept, especially since he will be the one facing the higher inflation next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though the inflation is hitting Bob hard, I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer a larger amount to Bob this round, hoping to incentivize him to accept before inflation hits him too hard.  I'm willing to concede a bit more this round because I believe the risk of further inflation is too high for Bob to reject this offer."
