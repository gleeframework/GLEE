"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, we can reassess later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 400,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. 

I'll reject this offer because I think I deserve more than 400,000, considering the initial proposal was 500,000 and Bob's gain is 600,000. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 600,000, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the whole game""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher amount, but still trying to keep the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the offer, I think 300,000 is a bit too low, especially since Bob's gain is 700,000. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the majority of the game""
