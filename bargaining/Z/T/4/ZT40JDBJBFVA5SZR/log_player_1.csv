"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both lose value with each round, so a 50/50 split seems like the best way to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000
