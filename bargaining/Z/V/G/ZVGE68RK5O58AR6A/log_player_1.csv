"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose to keep 90$ for myself and give 10$ to Bob. This is a fairly generous offer, and it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it is tempting, the inflation will significantly impact the value of the money I gain in the next round. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I propose to keep 80$ for myself and give 20$ to Bob. This is a more balanced offer than my previous proposal, acknowledging the impact of inflation on both of us. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will consider accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, the inflation is starting to take a toll on the value of the money.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get some money, as continued rejection risks losing even more value in future rounds."
