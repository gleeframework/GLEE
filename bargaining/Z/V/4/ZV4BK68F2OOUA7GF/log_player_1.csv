I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  I figure that by giving him a smaller share now, he might be more likely to accept, rather than risk losing out in the next round when the money becomes less valuable for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than the one I proposed in the first round, even considering the inflation. I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

Since Bob rejected my generous first offer, I'm going to try a slightly more aggressive approach. This offer still gives Bob a decent chunk of the money, but it also reflects that I'm not afraid to walk away if he keeps rejecting my offers. The inflation will be working in my favor this round, so I can afford to be a bit bolder."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is terrible, but it's the best I'm going to get. The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I don't want to risk another round. I'm accepting this, but I'm feeling very cheated."
