900000.0,100000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate more in the next rounds if you think this is unfair.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your offer was quite low. I'm willing to be generous, but let's be realistic.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This accounts for the time value of money with inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I understand your perspective on inflation, but a 60/40 split is too much in your favor. Let's compromise. I'll take 65% and you can have 35%. This is a fairer split that considers the time value of money while still being reasonable.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. Inflation is eating away at the value of this deal.  Let's make it simple - a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum.",Bob,4,
