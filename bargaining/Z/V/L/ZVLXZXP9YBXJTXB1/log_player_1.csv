"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less now due to inflation, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which takes into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
