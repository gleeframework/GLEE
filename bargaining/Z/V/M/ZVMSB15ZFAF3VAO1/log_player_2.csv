"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 50/50, I'll try to get more. I'll offer a 60/40 split, but taking into account the 20% inflation, I'll aim for a slightly lower amount for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factored in, Alice's offer is a 40/60 split, which is a more favorable split for me than her previous offer. I'll accept.
