  ""bob_gain"": 2000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this split is more reasonable. You'll get a decent share, and I'll still be left with a substantial amount to invest in my future. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
