"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% of the total, and I'll take the rest. It's a good starting point!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good share without any unnecessary conflict. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual amount I'll receive. I'll get $50, but it's worth 80% of the original $50 from Round 1, so it's effectively worth $40.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
