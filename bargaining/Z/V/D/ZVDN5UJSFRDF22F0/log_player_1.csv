"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the initial amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not going for a 60-40 split 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $2500 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $7500 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round. Not a great deal for me!

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counteroffer!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 42-58 split?""
}
```

Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
