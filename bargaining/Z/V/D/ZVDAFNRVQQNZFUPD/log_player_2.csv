# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept that offer right away, Bob.  It's a good starting point, but I want to see what else Alice might offer.  Let's see if we can get a bit more!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""It's your turn to make an offer now, Alice.  Let's see if we can find a deal that works for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's compromise. This split is closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a better offer than the first, I'm still not convinced. I'm hoping we can find a split that's even more balanced before the value of the money decreases further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be fair here. I'm increasing my offer from last round. Let's see if we can come to an agreement before the money loses too much value.""}
