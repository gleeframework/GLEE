Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer. Since we don't know how Bob will react to the inflation, I want to secure a large portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more, I don't know how Bob will react to inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least half of the money, even with the 20% reduction in value."
