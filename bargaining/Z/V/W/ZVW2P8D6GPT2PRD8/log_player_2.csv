**Reasoning:**

Alice is still trying to take a larger share, even though the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. While a 50/50 split is ideal, getting slightly less than that is better than nothing, which is what will happen if we run out of rounds.  I'll hold out a bit longer and hope Alice gets more desperate to make a deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it - a final offer for a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it, Alice.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The time for negotiation is dwindling.  Offering a 50/50 split is the fairest option and now carries a sense of urgency. It's a clear and strong message to Alice that she risks getting nothing if she continues to play games."
