4000.0,6000.0,"I understand you want a fair split, but the inflation puts me at a disadvantage in later rounds. This offer accounts for that and still allows us both to benefit.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I understand your concerns, but I need a slightly better deal to account for the inflation. This offer is still beneficial for both of us.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, the clock is ticking and the value is diminishing with each round. This offer secures a good amount for both of us. Let's be pragmatic and finalize the deal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, this back and forth is pointless. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial. Let's not let greed get in the way of a good deal.",Alice,5,
