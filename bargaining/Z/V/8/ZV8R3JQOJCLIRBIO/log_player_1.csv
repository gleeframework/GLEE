"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000:100,000 split in my favor. I figure a large initial offer will demonstrate good faith and hopefully encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm offering an 810,000:190,000 split.  Since we both lost value from the previous round, I'm still offering a significant share to Bob, but I need to ensure I get the majority to recoup some of my losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it is frustrating to be offered such a low amount, considering the inflation impact, this offer is likely better than what I'd get in the next round. I'd rather secure something now than risk getting nothing."
