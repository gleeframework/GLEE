"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 8000 for me and 2000 for you is a fair split.  It's a bit more for me than your offer, but we're both getting something, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
