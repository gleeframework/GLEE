Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that time is running out, her offer still heavily favors her. The inflation is working in my favor and I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to get a better deal.  It's still better to hold out for a larger share than settle for 44% at this point."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest offer you'll get, especially with the inflation."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to make a more aggressive move. Offering a 50/50 split might seem generous, but with the accelerating inflation, Alice is losing more value with each passing round. This offer highlights the fairness while subtly leveraging the time pressure."
