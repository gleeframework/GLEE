"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is a relatively small amount. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair share, implying that I'm open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, I offered Bob 20, which is 20% of 100. Now, I'm being offered 30, which is 30% of 100, but it's actually worth 30 / 0.95 = 31.58 in the original terms. So, in terms of the original money, Bob is offering me 70 - 31.58 = 38.42.

Considering this, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make another proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway""
}
```

I'm now offering Bob 50% of the original $100, which is a more generous offer than my initial one. My message suggests that I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway, implying that I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your halfway point, but I still want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer in the original terms. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In the first round, I offered Bob 20, which is 20% of 100. Now, I'm being offered 40, which is 40% of 100, but it's actually worth 40 / 0.8567 = 46.59 in the original terms. So, in terms of the original money, Bob is offering me 60 - 46.59 = 13.41.

Considering this, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's now my turn to make another proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need some assurance""
}
```

I'm now offering Bob 45% of the original $100, which is a slightly more generous offer than my previous one. My message suggests that I'm willing to give him a bit more, but I'm looking for some reassurance that he's willing to meet me at this point."
