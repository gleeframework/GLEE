"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount and can still negotiate further if you'd like.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair for us both to have a chance at getting a larger share.  Let's flip the script from last round - I'll take the larger share, but I'm open to discussing a more even split in later rounds if that's what you'd prefer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my potential gain of $400,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $320,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking a smaller share, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the smaller share, Bob. I'd like to propose an alternative.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the $1,000,000 is now worth 64% of its original value, which is $640,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Given the decreasing value of money, I'd like to aim for a slightly more even split. This way, we can both get a decent amount and still have room for negotiation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which seems more reasonable to me considering the reduced value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
