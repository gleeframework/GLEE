"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $40, which is a relatively fair share, considering the money's value decreases by 5% for him in each round. This way, Bob has an incentive to accept the offer rather than risking a lower value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer of a 45-55 split is still not favorable to me, considering the money's value remains the same for me but decreases for Bob. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money for him. However, I'll still aim to get a better deal than his previous offer.\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\nThis offer is closer to the middle ground between our previous proposals, but it still takes into account the fact that the money's value decreases for Bob with each passing round. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob."
