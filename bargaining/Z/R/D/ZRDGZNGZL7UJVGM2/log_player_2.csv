Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit less, but still more than you'll get if we keep going 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my diminishing returns. While the gap is closing, accepting this offer would still give her significantly more. It's getting risky, but I need to push for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  It's better than what you'll get if we continue and inflation eats away at my share.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out and the value of my share is decreasing rapidly.  I need to signal that I'm serious about getting a reasonable deal. Offering a slight edge to Alice might be enough to entice her to accept, especially with the ultimatum attached."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. This is a better deal for you than waiting further 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but the situation is getting dire. Accepting this offer yields 4400, which is significantly reduced due to inflation, but rejecting it means risking even lower offers in subsequent rounds. The potential gains from holding out are outweighed by the risk of ending up with nothing."
