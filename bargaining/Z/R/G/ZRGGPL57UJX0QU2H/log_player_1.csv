Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging. This is the fairest offer, and the longer we wait, the less we both get. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is mounting, accepting Bob's offer at this stage would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential earnings due to inflation. Bob is clearly trying to hold out for a 60/40 split, but that's not acceptable given the faster rate of inflation affecting Alice's potential gains.  It's time to show Bob that further stalling won't work."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  We're running out of time!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer reflects the urgency of the situation.  

* **Compromise:**  It's a slight concession from the previous offer to show a willingness to negotiate.
* **Firmness:** The ""take it or leave it"" message signals to Bob that further stalling won't result in a better deal for him.  
* **Time pressure:**  The mention of time emphasizes the diminishing returns for both sides if they don't reach an agreement soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking to my previous offer.  We're losing money with each round, and this is the most fair way to split it. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical. While Bob's offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means risking a significantly smaller amount in future rounds due to the accelerating inflation. It's a bitter pill to swallow, but holding out any longer might lead to an even worse outcome. It's time to cut losses and secure what's left."
