I'm going for a 90/10 split. I think it's a fair starting point, given that we're both in a position to take advantage of the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. Even with the inflation, I can do better than a 40/60 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going for a 60/40 split.  This time I'm taking a more aggressive approach. Bob rejected my previous offer, so I'm going to try and get a better share. The inflation is a factor, but I'm confident I can still get a good outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Even with the high inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With the inflation escalating, I'm going for a 50/50 split. This is the most fair and likely the only offer Bob will accept at this point. It's better to secure half than risk getting nothing with further rounds."
