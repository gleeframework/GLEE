"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000, and we can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Considering the inflation, my potential gain of $400,000 is worth 95% of the original $500,000, which is a significant reduction. On the other hand, Bob's offer is still a decent share, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing further erosion of the value of the money.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
