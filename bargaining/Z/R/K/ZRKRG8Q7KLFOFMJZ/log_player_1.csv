# Bob gain: 580000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting greedier, and the decreasing value makes each round more costly. While his offer is closer to a potential agreement, holding out a bit longer might push him to a more equitable split.  I'm aiming for at least a 45/55 split in my favor."
