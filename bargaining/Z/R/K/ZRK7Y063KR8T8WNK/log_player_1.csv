"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 90% and you can have 10% for now. We can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm making a bold opening offer, taking 90% of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, especially considering the inflation rates we're facing. Let's start with this, and we can adjust later if needed. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I'm ready to accept an even split just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think I can do better than that. The inflation rate is 20% for me, so my gain should be worth more than 50% of the original amount. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the disparity.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. This way, I'll still be the one taking the hit, but I'll give you a smaller share.""
}
```"
