900000.0,100000.0,Let's get this started! I'll take 90% and you can have 10% for now. We can reassess in the next round.,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"I think a more even split is fairer, especially considering the inflation rates we're facing. Let's start with this, and we can adjust later if needed.",Bob,2,
,,"I think I can do better than that. The inflation rate is 20% for me, so my gain should be worth more than 50% of the original amount. I'll wait for a better offer.",Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. This way, I'll still be the one taking the hit, but I'll give you a smaller share.",Alice,3,
