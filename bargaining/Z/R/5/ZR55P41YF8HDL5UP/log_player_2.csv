I'm not sure Alice understands the rules of the game yet.  If I accept her offer, I get $4,000 and she gets $6,000.  I think I can do better than that.  Let's see what happens if I counter-propose."

Alice still seems to be ignoring the inflation factor. I'm getting less and less for each round, while she's staying the same. I can do better than this."

Alice is clearly not understanding the impact of inflation.  I'm losing a significant portion of my potential earnings with each round, and she's staying static. I'm going to need to be more assertive in my negotiations."

Alice is trying to pressure me with the time limit, but I'm not giving in.  I'm losing too much money with each passing round.  I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."

Round 8

Alice is clearly playing a game of chicken, but I'm not going to give in. I've lost too much already, and I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with practically nothing.  Let's see what happens in the next round."

Alice is playing a dangerous game. While I'm losing a significant amount with each round, her offer is still not remotely fair. I'm going to hold out for a better deal, even if it means we both get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8500, ""alice_gain"": 1500, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  I've lost a huge amount of money due to inflation, and I need to get something back. If you don't accept, we both walk away with nothing.  Think carefully.""}
``` 
I'm throwing everything I have left into this offer.  It's the last round, and I'm desperate to get something, even if it's not what I started with.  If Alice rejects this, it's over for both of us."
