"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm starting with a fair offer to split the money evenly.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is unfair, and I'm not going to accept it. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to 55 for myself, but still leaving a decent portion for Bob. I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. Let's see if he'll accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting a bit risky to keep rejecting offers, considering the inflation. I'll take the 45, as it's better than nothing."
