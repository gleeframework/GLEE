Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor.  I'm taking a bit of a risk here, but I think it's a good starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even with the inflation, taking 55$ is a good deal.  It's better than the 47.50 I'd get with a 95/5 split in round 3.  Let's take the deal!"
