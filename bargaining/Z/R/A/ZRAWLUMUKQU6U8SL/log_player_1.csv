"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a slightly more even split.  Let's see if this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $600,000 from the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'm effectively getting $480,000.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his proposal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
