"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money, Bob. I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Please let me know when it's my turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'll try to be strategic about it. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split. Let's divide it this way, Alice!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better offer than yours. Let's close the deal before inflation eats into your share even more. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. The inflation is a concern, but I'm not satisfied with the current split. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more considering the inflation is eating into my share. Let's meet in the middle!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real.  The inflation is only getting worse for you. This is the fairest offer you'll get - a straight 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Although the inflation is a significant concern, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better deal. A straight 50/50 split doesn't account for the fact that the money is worth less to me with each passing round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's move on to the next round! I'll try to make a more strategic offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, considering the increasing inflation and the fact that Alice is not budging much. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 51,
""alice_gain"": 49,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the 50/50 offer, but I'm still taking a hit from the inflation. I'll take a tiny bit more to compensate. This is as close to fair as I can get.""}"
