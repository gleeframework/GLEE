"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, but I'm hoping to get the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being a bit greedy, aren't you? I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to call me out on my greed!

Considering the offer, I'll think for a moment... 

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share now to make up for it. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
