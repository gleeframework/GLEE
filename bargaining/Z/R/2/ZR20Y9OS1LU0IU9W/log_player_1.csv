I'm taking a big chunk for myself, but giving Bob something to hopefully make him accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm still taking a big chunk for myself, but I'm increasing Bob's share a bit to make him think about it.  Inflation is biting, and I need to secure something decent for myself before it gets worse!"
