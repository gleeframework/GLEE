"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 4000 for me and 6000 for her, and I rejected it, I'll try to do slightly better. My offer is:
{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less for me due to inflation, I need to adjust my strategy. My offer in round 2 was 4200, which is now worth even less due to inflation. Alice's offer is 4500 for me, which is slightly more. I'll accept this offer to minimize the losses due to inflation.
