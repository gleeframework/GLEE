I'm rejecting this offer. Even though the money is losing value, I still believe I can get a better deal. There are only a few rounds left, and I'm not ready to settle for a 50/50 split yet."

I'm sticking with a similar offer as before. Time is running out, and Bob is losing more and more money with each passing round.  I believe this is the best offer I can make to maximize my share."
