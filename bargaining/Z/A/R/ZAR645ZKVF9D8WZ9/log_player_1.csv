This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it's not too greedy. I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round, especially considering the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I won't give in. I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still proposing a majority for myself. I'm hoping Bob will realize that rejecting my offer again might lead to a less favorable outcome for him in the future rounds."
