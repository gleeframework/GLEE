"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split. It's a fairer split than the last one, and allows both of us to get a decent amount. Let's finish this quickly to minimize inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
