"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering to split the money evenly, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. With this offer, I'd be getting $300,000, which is a smaller share than I initially proposed.

After considering the offer, I decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm offering a slightly more skewed split, with me getting a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another round!

Considering the offer, I notice that the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means my gain is even smaller than before. With this offer, I'd be getting $400,000, which is a smaller share than my initial proposal.

After weighing the options, I decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 480000, ""bob_gain"": 520000}

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a slightly larger share and still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
