"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the actual values are:

My gain: $40 / 0.8 = $50
Bob's gain: $60 / 0.95 = $63.16

I don't think I like this offer. I'd rather wait for a better proposal. Here's my response:
