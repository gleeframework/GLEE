Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to a 60/40 split.  While time is a factor, accepting a significantly smaller share now will likely result in getting even less later as Alice senses your desperation. It's a risky gamble, but holding out for a better offer might be necessary."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We both lose if this goes on much longer.  This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the value is decreasing rapidly.  
* **Strong Stance:** By phrasing it as a ""final offer,"" Bob shows he's serious and unlikely to budge much further. 
* **Slight Advantage:** Offering slightly more than half shows a willingness to compromise, but not by much. This might be enough to get Alice to concede, especially with the looming deadline."
