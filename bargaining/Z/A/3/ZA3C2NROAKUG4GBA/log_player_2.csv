"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I want most of the money. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While waiting is risky due to inflation, Alice clearly wants a significant portion of the money. There's room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I'm proposing a more even split that reflects the fact we both lose out if this drags on.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant share to make this worthwhile. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice calling this her ""final offer"" at Round 3 is likely a bluff.  While her offer is better, it still heavily favors her. Bob needs to show he's serious about getting a more reasonable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting serious.  We both lose if we keep playing this game. I'm offering a fair split, but time is running out.""
