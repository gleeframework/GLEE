"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much ground. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 450,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 360,000. And Bob's gain of 550,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 380,000.

I'm not too thrilled with the offer, but it's a slightly better deal than the first one. I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly better deal than before. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 48% and you get 52%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
