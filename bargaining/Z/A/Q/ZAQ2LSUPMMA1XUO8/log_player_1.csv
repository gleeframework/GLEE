"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 2, I noticed that Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, which is a bit skewed. I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let me analyze the new offer from Bob. Considering that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less, I think this offer is actually a bit more favorable to me than my previous offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll take a chance and accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
