"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 7:3""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is more fair, considering the value of money is likely to decrease further. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the 400,000$ I would gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 320,000$. However, considering the value of money will continue to decrease, I think a 6:4 split is indeed more fair.

I accept Bob's offer.
