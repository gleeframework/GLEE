{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'll start by taking almost everything, leaving Bob with just a token amount. This is a classic strategy to see if Bob is willing to play the long game."

I'll increase Bob's share slightly, but still keep the majority for myself.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but not drastically."

I'm increasing Bob's share a bit more. We're now getting closer to a 50/50 split. This is starting to feel like a reasonable compromise, but I still want a slightly larger share."

{""alice_gain"": 999960, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm increasing Bob's share again, but still keeping the majority. I think this is a good compromise and hopefully Bob will see it that way.  We are getting close to the end of the game and we need to reach an agreement."

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 999960 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to continue to reject these offers. Bob is still being unreasonable, and with only 2 rounds left, I need to make sure we can reach a fair agreement. I'm ready to compromise, but I'm not going to settle for a huge disparity in the split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is it! I'm offering a 50/50 split. With only one round left, I'm betting that Bob will realize we're both going to get nothing if he doesn't accept.  Time for some serious negotiation."
