Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the inflation is working against me. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough decision, but here's why accepting is the best choice for Bob:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is hitting Alice harder each round. While this round looks like Alice is getting a better deal, the value of her share is decreasing rapidly. 
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer more in subsequent rounds. She might get desperate and offer an even lower amount, hoping Bob will accept to get anything at all.
* **Guaranteed Gain:** Accepting guarantees Bob a reasonable $350,000. Rejecting risks getting a worse deal or even nothing if the negotiations completely break down. 

While Bob could gamble on getting more in later rounds, the decreasing value of the money for Alice combined with the uncertainty makes this a risky proposition. Accepting the current offer secures a decent amount."
