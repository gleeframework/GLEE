Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to split, but a 50/50 split after I made the first offer isn't ideal.  How about 55/45? We need to compromise before inflation hurts us further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
