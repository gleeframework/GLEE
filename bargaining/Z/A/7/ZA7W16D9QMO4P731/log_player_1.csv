"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me. But I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
