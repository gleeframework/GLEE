Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose that I get $90 and Bob gets $10.  This is a fair starting point, as I'm taking a larger share, but I am leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm reducing my share slightly to 80% to show I'm willing to compromise, but still keeping a larger portion due to the inflation disadvantage affecting me less."

# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
The inflation is getting worse, but I'm still not willing to accept a deal where I get less than a quarter of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will see that we both have a lot to lose if we keep going."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not a fair deal considering the inflation disadvantage I'm facing. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to ensure I get a reasonable share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm reducing my share to 60%, which is a significant compromise. I'm hoping this demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  The inflation is hurting both of us, and I'm hoping we can both get something before it's too late."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I still need a larger share to compensate for the inflation disadvantage. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept a deal that leaves me with a smaller share than Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a true compromise, recognizing the serious inflation that is affecting us both.  With only a few rounds left,  I'm willing to split the money evenly to ensure we both get something."
