"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, but I'm willing to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous share considering the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, but I'm not sure if that's the best option for me. Considering the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the previous round. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a decent share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! My gain of $600,000 is worth only 60.9% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the reduced value of the money.

However, I don't want to risk waiting too long and losing even more value. I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
