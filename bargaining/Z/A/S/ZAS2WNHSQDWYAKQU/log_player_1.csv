"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
 
I propose a 60/40 split, with me receiving $6,000 and Bob receiving $4,000. This seems like a fair starting point given the inflation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a significant factor.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than my initial proposal."
