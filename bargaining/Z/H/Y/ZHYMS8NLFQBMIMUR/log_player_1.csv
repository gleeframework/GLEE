"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""
}
```

I'm offering to take $55 and give Bob $45, considering that the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob with each round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to consider the inflation impact, but I also think it's important to split the money more evenly. This offer takes into account the inflation for both of us, and allows us to end the game sooner. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, this is a more balanced offer""
}


I've adjusted my offer to take into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I'm hoping Bob will find this proposal more acceptable."
