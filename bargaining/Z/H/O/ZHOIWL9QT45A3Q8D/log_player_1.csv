"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm trying to maximize my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of me in the second round!

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to think carefully about this offer. However, Bob's gain is only 5% less, which means he's getting a better deal than I am.

I'll reject this offer and try to make a better one in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round, due to the cumulative effect of inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, taking a slightly larger share to compensate for the decreased value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully about it. Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to adjust my expectations. However, Bob's gain is still a significant amount, and I don't want to give up too much.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can do better in the next round.
