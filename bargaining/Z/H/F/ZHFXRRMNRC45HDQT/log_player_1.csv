"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'm actually getting $18.8 (20 - 5% of 20).

Bob's gain of $80 is worth 20% less than his original gain of $40, so he's actually getting $32.

Considering this, I'll make a decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm actually getting $8.64 (10 - 14.26% of 10).

Bob's gain of $90 is worth 48.8% less than his original gain of $40, so he's actually getting $20.4.

Considering this, I'll make a decision.
