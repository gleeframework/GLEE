**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is still tilted in his favor, accepting is the best course of action at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Bob. Waiting for a potentially better offer in later rounds is risky.
* **Bob's Declining Position:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, evidenced by him returning to his initial offer. This suggests he's becoming more willing to compromise.
* **Certainty:** Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum. Rejecting keeps the risk of walking away with nothing at all."
