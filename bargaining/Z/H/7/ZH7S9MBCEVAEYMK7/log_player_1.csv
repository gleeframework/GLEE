"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount of $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering the new values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. I'd like to make a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and preparing to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is a fairer split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting 70% and Bob getting 30%. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering the new values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I think we've reached a fair agreement. 50-50 it is!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we can finally settle on a division of the $100!"
