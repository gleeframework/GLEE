Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a very small share to start. I figure if he's greedy he'll reject it and I can offer him a slightly better deal next round. If he accepts, well, that's a win for me!  Let's see what he does."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting much too greedy! I'll take my chances and try to get a better deal in the next round.  I can't believe he's asking for 90% of the money!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to offer Bob an even split this time. I think it's a fair offer, and hopefully, he'll see that it's in his best interest to take it.  After all, the longer we play, the less money there is to divide!"
