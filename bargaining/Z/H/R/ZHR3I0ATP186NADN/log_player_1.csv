"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation hits you harder, this is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less we both get.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest solution.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Each round costs you more, I'm being generous considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation mechanic. While my potential gains are decreasing, accepting a deal this far in my disadvantage sets a bad precedent. I need to show Bob I'm willing to push this further to get a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4700,
""bob_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""This offer still gives you a slight advantage, Bob, but reflects the urgency of settling before inflation eats further into our potential winnings. Let's be done with this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

I need to make a move that suggests I'm willing to compromise, but not to the extent Bob is pushing for. By accepting some loss compared to my previous offer, I signal flexibility while still aiming for a better outcome than Bob's last proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is taking its toll on your share, I'm willing to end this now with a reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While this offer is far from ideal, the increasing inflation rate is rapidly eroding my potential gains. Accepting this offer cuts my losses. Holding out further risks even less favorable outcomes in future rounds, as Bob knows the pressure is on me to settle."
