I'm starting with a generous offer, aiming for a quick agreement.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable than my initial offer, and the inflation is starting to bite. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm lowering my share slightly to account for inflation, but I'm still aiming for a fair deal that benefits both of us. Let's see if Bob is more willing to negotiate this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

Inflation is hitting hard now, but Bob's offer is still significantly less than what I was willing to settle for in previous rounds. I'll reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm trying to stay flexible but also need to secure a decent portion of the money. I'm lowering my offer slightly again but still aiming for a split that's fair, considering the impact of inflation. Let's see if this offer is more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation is hitting hard, Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm willing to accept at this stage. I'll reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share further to account for the increasing inflation. I'm still hoping to reach an agreement, but I'm running out of rounds and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than previous rounds, the inflation is truly biting into the value of my potential earnings. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round. There's still a chance to reach a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

We're approaching the end of the game, and inflation is making every round more critical.  I'm lowering my share further, hoping to finally secure an agreement before the value of the money dwindles to nothing.  It's a gamble, but I believe a 55/45 split is still a fair compromise considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only a few rounds left, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money. Even though Bob's offer is still not ideal, it's getting closer to a 50/50 split and with the decreasing value of the money, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing."
