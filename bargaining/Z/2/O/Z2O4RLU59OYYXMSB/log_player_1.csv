"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'd like to build on this foundation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to make a counteroffer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 75-25 split, and I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'd like to make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Compromise on a slightly more equal split, considering inflation""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which I think is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meeting you halfway, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer because it's a 50-50 split, which is a significant improvement from the previous offers. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I think this is a fair compromise. I'm willing to end the game here and accept Bob's offer."
