I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a small share. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can both get a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'm not happy with the 50/50 split, it's better than risking it all and getting nothing. The inflation is already hitting hard, and I don't want to risk getting even less in future rounds."
