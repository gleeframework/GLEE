Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, the deal is still not favorable to me (Bob). I need to push for a larger share while it's still strategically advantageous. Each round that passes significantly reduces the value of her potential winnings, making her more likely to accept a less favorable offer later."
