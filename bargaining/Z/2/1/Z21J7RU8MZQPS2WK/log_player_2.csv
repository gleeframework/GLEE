"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous split for me.  Hope you agree! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer might seem tempting at first, considering the inflation rates, it's much more advantageous to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round.  The inflation rate is much higher for Alice, so she may be willing to offer a better deal to avoid losing even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  We both lose value with each round, so let's split it closer to 50/50.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be more flexible now.  Let's split it 55/45, recognizing that we both lose money with every round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, Alice's offer is now more advantageous for me than rejecting and potentially getting nothing. It is important to consider the inflation rates and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree in the next few rounds."
