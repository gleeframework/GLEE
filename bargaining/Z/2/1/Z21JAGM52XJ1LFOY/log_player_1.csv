"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly smaller share""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better split, and this offer is quite close to a 50/50 split. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm trying to find a balance between my initial offer and Bob's offer, hoping that this compromise will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but still a good compromise 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. The money is worth even less for me now, and I'm not willing to accept a 55/45 split. I was hoping for a better deal, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly for me. I'll try to negotiate again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I'm getting desperate""}

I'm proposing that I get $4,800 and Bob gets $5,200. I'm trying to be more flexible and willing to accept a slightly smaller share, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm making a genuine effort to compromise and accept this offer."
