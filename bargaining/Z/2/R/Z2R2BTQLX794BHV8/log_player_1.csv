"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly, giving us both $500,000 each. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm keeping the majority 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a bigger share. Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still trying to keep a decent amount for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give you the majority 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is still trying to take the majority of the money. The inflation has really taken a toll on my potential gain, and I'm now worth only 72.9% of what I was worth in the first round.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

  ""bob_gain"": 780000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an even larger share, but trying to hold on to as much as I can. Let's see if he'll take it!"
