"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money this round, but I promise to be more generous as the rounds go on. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer seems vaguely promising, there's no guarantee she'll actually be more generous in future rounds. It's a risk to accept such a low amount, especially since the money will be worth less for Alice as the game goes on.  I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer is fair and benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split the money evenly this time, Bob. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a fair offer, especially considering the inflation working against Alice. Accepting ensures we both get a reasonable share."
