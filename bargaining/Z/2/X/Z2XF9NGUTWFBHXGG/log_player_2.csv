Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear I'm not budging much.  Take this deal while you still have a decent chunk left! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is making my gains significantly smaller with each passing round.  It's better to accept this offer and secure some money rather than risk losing even more."
