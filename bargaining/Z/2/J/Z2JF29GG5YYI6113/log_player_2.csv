Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your offer was close to fair, but slightly favored you. I propose a more balanced split considering the inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This is the last round where I can propose a split that benefits us both before inflation eats significantly into the pot. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
