"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept it.  Since I have the advantage of the first offer, I want to maximize my share.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even considering the 20% inflation on my side. I'll reject this and see if I can negotiate something better in the next round.  I still have the advantage of the next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a large portion. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I assume he wants a bigger share. However, I'm still confident I can secure a good deal for myself.  Let's see if this is acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the 48.8% inflation, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my initial proposal.  I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially since I'll have the chance to make the next offer.  I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a large portion.  The inflation is hurting me, so I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and ensuring Bob accepts. Hopefully, he'll see the value in this offer before the inflation hurts him too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. Even with the 67% inflation, I think I can still get a better deal for myself in the next round. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt, so I'm going to need to make a more significant concession.  However, I'm still holding out for a decent share.  This offer is more reasonable, and I'm hoping that Bob will see it as a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting me hard now, and I'm worried that if I reject again, I might get nothing at all.  Bob's offer is finally starting to become more attractive, and a 50/50 split is fair considering the circumstances.  I'll accept this offer and take what I can get."
