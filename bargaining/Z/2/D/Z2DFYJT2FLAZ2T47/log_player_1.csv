"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, where I'll get $40 and Bob will get $60. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good way to begin the game."
