"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous offer for myself.  I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable and accept this in the first round.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair, and even though I'm losing 5% of my potential earnings due to inflation, I'm not going to accept this deal.  I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than last time, since he rejected my previous offer.  I'm hoping that the threat of inflation will make him more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very stubborn, but I'm still not willing to accept such an unfair offer.  The inflation is hurting, but I'm going to hold out for a better deal. I have faith I can get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still confident that I can secure a better deal than Bob is offering. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm determined to get a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm sticking to my principles. Even with the inflation, I refuse to accept such an uneven split. I'm sure I can get a better deal if I hold out a little longer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. This time, I'm offering a larger share to Bob, hoping he will see the diminishing returns of continuing to reject offers.  This might be the tipping point, but I'm still holding out for a fair deal for myself."
