"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me less than 50. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's previous offer was 60-40, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to an equal split. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
