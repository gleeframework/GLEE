Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a little more than last time 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that my position weakens with each round due to inflation, her offer is still not favorable. I need to hold out for a better deal, aiming for at least a 45/55 split in my favor, even if it means taking a bigger hit from inflation later."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me!  While this isn't ideal, getting 44% now is better than holding out for a slightly better deal and getting even less later. Alice knows time is on her side."
