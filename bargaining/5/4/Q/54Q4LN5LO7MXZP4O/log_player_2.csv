"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation affects you more. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current proposal doesn't quite meet my expectations, especially considering the impact of inflation on my share. I believe we can find a more balanced division. Let's move to the next round where I can propose an alternative."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'd like to make an offer that I believe is more balanced, taking into account the inflation factor for both of us. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, I propose a slightly higher share for myself to compensate for the greater depreciation on my side. This way, we both get a significant amount, and it's more balanced in terms of real value over time.""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer heavily favors you in the long run. Let's meet in the middle for a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll respond to Alice's offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

###\n\nThe current offer from Alice still doesn't adequately address the difference in inflation impact between us. Meeting in the middle doesn't necessarily mean it's fair, given the disproportionate effect of inflation on my share. I'd like to proceed to the next round to find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing impact of inflation and the need to find a mutually acceptable division. Here's my proposal for round 4:

{""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Given the rising impact of inflation, I'm willing to adjust my share slightly downward to meet Alice halfway in terms of real value loss. This proposal aims to balance the immediate gains with the long-term value for both of us.""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to settle this soon. I'm proposing a compromise - taking slightly less than my previous offer to get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll respond to Alice's offer from round 5.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my share, which is now worth 34.39% less than in the first round, and the risk of losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, I believe accepting this offer is the most prudent decision. Alice's slight compromise from her previous offer shows a willingness to meet in the middle, and given the circumstances, this seems like the best outcome I can achieve."
