Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start, hoping he'll accept. It's better than nothing, and there's plenty of rounds left for him to get a better deal if he refuses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept this offer. Even though I'm not getting my desired share, it's a fair split and I don't want to risk losing more money due to inflation."
