# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal doesn't seem fair to me, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."

# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still think this offer doesn't adequately account for the difference in inflation rates between us. I'd like to proceed to the next round and see if we can find a more balanced agreement."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Given the increasing impact of inflation, I'll adjust my offer to find a middle ground that considers both our losses.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's adjust for the increased inflation impact and meet closer to a fair middle ground.""}"

# Alice's message: This is a compromise, Bob. I'm taking a risk with the increasing inflation, but this split feels more equitable given the circumstances.  
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, especially on Alice, I believe this offer still doesn't fully compensate for the difference in our inflation rates. I'd like to proceed and try to find a split that better reflects our shared risk."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Given the substantial inflation impact, particularly on your end, I'm willing to adjust my offer to share the burden more equitably, but I also need to consider my own loss in value.""}"

Round 7

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This offer acknowledges the inflation impact on both sides while ensuring we both leave with something. Let's be practical. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on both of us and the risk of losing everything if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, I believe this offer is the most practical and fair compromise at this point. It's better to accept this and walk away with something rather than risk getting nothing."
