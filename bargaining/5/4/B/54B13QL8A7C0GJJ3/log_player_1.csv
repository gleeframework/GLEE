Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% and Bob gets 20%. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."

# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 2:3 split, but I'll consider it.

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more value for myself, while still being somewhat reasonable. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject this offer."
