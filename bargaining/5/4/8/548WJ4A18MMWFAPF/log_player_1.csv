"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's find a middle ground. How about a 55/45 split? This accounts for the inflation you face while still being fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
