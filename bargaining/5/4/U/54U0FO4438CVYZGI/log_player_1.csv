"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me a large share of the money, but it's still a reasonable starting point. I want to see how Bob reacts to this initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being more aggressive in this round. I think I can still get a better deal, especially since inflation is only affecting his side. I'm going to reject this offer and see if he's willing to budge in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise a little. Inflation is starting to affect Bob's side more, so I'm hoping this offer is more appealing."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more aggressive with each round, but I still believe I can secure a better deal. Inflation is starting to significantly affect Bob's side, and I'm confident I can leverage that to my advantage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm still aiming for a majority. With each passing round, inflation is impacting Bob's side more and more.  I believe this offer is still attractive to him and will be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is becoming more attractive with each round. With inflation hitting his side harder, a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome considering the diminishing value of his portion."
