"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit from an early agreement. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too generous to her. While it seems reasonable at first glance, it's important to consider the impact of inflation. Since Bob's money is worth less with each round, he should aim for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly.  This is a fair starting point, and we can work towards a mutually beneficial agreement if we need to.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we both lose with every round. I'm being flexible, but let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's message is more urgent,  her offer is still not fair considering the inflation we're facing. My money is worth 9.75% less, and hers is worth 36% less.  I'll try to negotiate a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The longer we wait, the less our money is worth. This offer is closer to a fair split, taking into account the inflation we're facing. Let's agree on this and move on.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal, but this needs to end soon.  Time is literally money, and we're both losing. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's message is getting more urgent, but the offer is still not fair, even with the inflation. My money is worth 18.55% less than in the first round, while hers is worth 59.04% less. I'm not ready to accept such a lopsided deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with every passing round. Let's find a compromise. This offer is closer to a fair split considering the current inflation rates. I'm willing to negotiate further, but we need to reach an agreement soon.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money.  Let's end this now with a perfectly even split.  It's the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is finally fair, considering the inflation that has occurred. My money is worth 26.49% less than in the first round, and hers is worth 73.79% less. With time running out, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option."
