"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm passing the ball to Bob to make the next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share, but I'll be the one deciding how it's divided from now on. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take control of the negotiations.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation factor, Bob's gain of $8000 in this round is actually worth $6400 in real value, while my gain of $2000 is worth $2000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving up that much control and accepting a relatively small share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was rejected, it's my turn again. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the initial 50/50 proposal. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm still willing to give Bob a decent share. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still more than your initial 50/50 proposal. Don't expect any more generous offers from me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to wear me down with his offers.

Considering the inflation factor, Bob's gain of $6000 in this round is actually worth $3120 in real value, while my gain of $4000 is still worth $4000.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down. I think I deserve a larger share, and I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to get it. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, which is a significant increase from my previous offers. Let's see how Bob reacts to this bold move!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but don't think this is the last chance you'll get to make a deal. I'm not getting any more generous. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a final push before the game is over.

Considering the inflation factor, Bob's gain of $5500 in this round is actually worth $1840 in real value, while my gain of $4500 is still worth $4500.

I'm not sure I'm willing to accept this offer, especially since I was hoping for a better deal. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his word and not try to renegotiate later.
