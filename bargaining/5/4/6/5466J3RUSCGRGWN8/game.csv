400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your offer was quite greedy! How about a more balanced approach? I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This leaves you with a significant sum while acknowledging my position as the first to propose.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"I understand your desire for a larger share, but your proposal was still too unbalanced. Let's compromise at 55/45. This way, we both get a fair share, and we can move on to the next round without losing more money to inflation.",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, I appreciate the move towards a compromise. However, 55/45 still leans too heavily in your favor. I propose 58/42. This recognizes your slight advantage due to the inflation rates, but still provides me a reasonable share.",Bob,4,
