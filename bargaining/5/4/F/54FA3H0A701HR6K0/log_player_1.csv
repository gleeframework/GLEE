"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $300,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $240,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 75-25 split, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
