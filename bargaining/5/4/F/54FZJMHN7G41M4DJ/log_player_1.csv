"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal of:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll decide to reject this offer and wait for a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage this time. I'll make a proposal of:

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
