"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000. This seems like a fair start, as I'm taking the majority but leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my demand slightly to 800,000, while increasing Bob's share to 200,000.  This is a compromise, acknowledging that I need to make a concession to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is getting a little dicey.  Bob's offer is still a good deal for him, but I am willing to hold out for a larger share, hoping he'll come back with a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share again, but only by 100,000. This is a smaller concession, demonstrating that I'm still willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to be bullied into accepting anything less than a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is getting greedy. I'm going to stick to my guns and see if he'll budge in the next round.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal, even with inflation hitting us both hard."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm willing to reduce my share by another 100,000, but I'm not going to give up much more than that.  Inflation is starting to bite hard, but I believe I can still secure a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  The inflation is really starting to hurt, but I'm going to try to hold out for another round to see if we can reach a more agreeable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is it. I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  Inflation is hitting us both hard, and I think this is the most fair and realistic way to avoid getting nothing."
