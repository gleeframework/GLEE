Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a more balanced split, Alice. Let's be fair.

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the fairest deal. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Bob's offer is nominally equal, the inflation disparity means he's getting a much better deal in real terms. I need to push for a slight advantage to make up for the inflation difference."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""bob_gain"": 420000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out, and the money's shrinking. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the inflation impact while still giving you a good share.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. This is a serious offer, slightly favoring you, but we need to settle this before inflation eats away our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This offer is slightly more beneficial to Bob in real terms due to the inflation disparity. However, it's better to accept a slightly less advantageous deal now than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
