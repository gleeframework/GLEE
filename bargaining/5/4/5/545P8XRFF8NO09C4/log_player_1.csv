"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll accept it.
