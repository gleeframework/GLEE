"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a good chunk for myself. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 40-60 split. I'll try to negotiate further to get a more favorable deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the value of money has decreased. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I still think I can get a better deal. The fact that the value of money has decreased due to inflation means that I'll have to work harder to get a good split, but I'm not ready to accept a 48-52 split just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split""
}
```

I'm pushing for a slightly better deal, trying to get closer to a 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I think I can still squeeze out a bit more. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make a final push...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. With the value of money decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in future rounds. 56-44 split is not ideal, but it's better than nothing. Let's end the game!"
