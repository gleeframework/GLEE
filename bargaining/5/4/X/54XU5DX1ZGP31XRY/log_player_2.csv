"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'll be losing more value if we delay. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, the game is designed to be strategic.  By rejecting, Bob can force Alice to make a better offer in the next round to avoid losing even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""It's your turn to lose value now, Alice. This offer is fairer, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise. I'm taking a hit from the inflation, but I'm offering you a larger share than your last proposal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is a slight improvement over her first offer.  Although I would prefer to have more, the inflation will only continue to hurt Alice more than me. It's a good deal for me at this point."
