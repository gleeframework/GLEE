"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think about it... 

```
{

  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, trying to find a middle ground."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I'm getting a good deal 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

With the new inflation rate, my gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (100% - 48.8%).

I'll think about it... 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
