"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'll give you a slightly smaller share since you started 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting, and my potential gain is worth 5% less than it was in the first round!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise. I'll accept his offer and take $5,000. The fact that he's meeting me in the middle and giving me a slightly smaller share than I initially proposed is a good sign.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
