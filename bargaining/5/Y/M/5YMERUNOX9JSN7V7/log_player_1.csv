Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure most of the money. I'll take $9,000, leaving $1,000 for Bob. Since I'm not sure how Bob feels about the inflation, I'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth less now, Bob's offer is still a fair split.  Taking $5,000 is better than risking getting less in the next round, especially since I don't know how the inflation is affecting Bob's decisions."
