"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected my offer, now it's your turn to lose out on the inflation benefits. I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{
