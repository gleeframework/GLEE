"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer to split the money evenly, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 20% less, so the new total is $800,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept it since it's a better deal than my initial offer. I'll have to be more careful with my next proposal, as the money will continue to decrease in value.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
