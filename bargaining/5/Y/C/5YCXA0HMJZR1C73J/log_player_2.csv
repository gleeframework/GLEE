"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal quickly, Bob. It would be a shame if this money lost its value! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it more fairly, Alice. I think we can both do better than your previous offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this money is losing value fast. My offer is still better for you than waiting any longer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the money is losing value quickly. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option for me at this point."
