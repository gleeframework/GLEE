"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer is based on the initial value of the money. As the value decreases with each round, consider accepting this proposal to secure a larger portion. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's too early to accept such a low offer.  There's still a lot of rounds left and the money is worth more to me now than it will be later.  I can hopefully get a better deal in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a more equitable split, considering the value of the money decreases with each round.  Let's work together to maximize our gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the diminishing value of money with each round, I propose an equal division. This ensures a fair outcome for both parties while maximizing the immediate value of the received amount. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is more attractive now, especially with the inflation factor. It's a fair split and ensures a good return for me.  It's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the future, so I'm accepting."
