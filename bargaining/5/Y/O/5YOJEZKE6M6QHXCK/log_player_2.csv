Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll try to be a bit more aggressive with my proposal.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer offer.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make up for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll think carefully about this offer, taking into account the impact of inflation on both of our gains.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI believe accepting this offer is the best course of action, given the decreasing value of the money with each round."
