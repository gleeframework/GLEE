"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 30, and I'll take 70.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and I'm not giving away too much too early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the changing value of the money. Let's move forward with this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since the money is worth less each round, I'd like to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal this round. I'll offer a slightly higher share to Bob, but still keep a decent amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 52, and I'll take 48. It's a fair split, considering the money's value is decreasing.""
}
```"
