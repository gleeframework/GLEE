"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100 and leaving 20% for Bob. This way, we can both get something and move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Meeting in the middle is a reasonable offer, considering the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer, and we can move on to the next round."
