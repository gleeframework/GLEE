Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I'm keeping 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. I hope he accepts, as the inflation will make the money less valuable in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, hoping he'll accept this time. Inflation is a real concern, and I need to secure a larger share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  I've lost a significant amount due to inflation. It's better to take this offer and secure at least some money."
