"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm offering a fair split, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a high offer, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll evaluate the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll calculate the effective gains as follows:

My gain: $3000
Bob's gain: $6300

I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
