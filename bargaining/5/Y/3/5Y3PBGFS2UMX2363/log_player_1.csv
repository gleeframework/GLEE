"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, with me taking 60% and Bob taking 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to make a strong offer 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a strong counteroffer!

I'll consider his proposal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too low, I'm not giving up 70%""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with only 30% of the total amount. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation (5% from the previous round + 5% from this round), I'll aim for a slightly higher offer to compensate.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a compromise""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to me, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were close, now I'll try to get closer to my target 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting closer to his target!

I'll consider his proposal:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still not there, I'm not giving up yet""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with only 45% of the total amount, but I'm not going to give up yet either. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 19.51% less due to inflation (5% from the first round + 5% from the second round + 9.51% from this round), I'll aim for a slightly higher offer to compensate.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 47.5,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer, let's find a sweet spot""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to me, but still leaving room for negotiation."
