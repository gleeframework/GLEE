Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want the larger share, but my previous offer was more than fair.  Let's be reasonable - I'll take $5,500 and you take $4,500. The value is decreasing with each round, so accepting now is in both our best interests. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
