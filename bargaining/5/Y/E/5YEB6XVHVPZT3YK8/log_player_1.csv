"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective amount I'll gain from Bob's offer.

In this case, Bob is offering to split the money 50/50, but since the money is worth 10% less, the effective amount I'll gain is 4500.

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation effect in mind, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than the initial $10,000 (10% less in each of the two previous rounds), I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than the initial $10,000, I'll consider the effective amount I'll gain from Bob's offer.

In this case, Bob is offering to give me $4000, which is actually a better deal than my previous offer, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll accept this offer.
