"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, a fair and simple proposal.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a straightforward and fair offer, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bit more this time, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive, considering the inflation.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much more.""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500. This is a slightly more aggressive offer than before, but I'm still leaving room for negotiation."
