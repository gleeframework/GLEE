Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a pretty aggressive opening, but I figure if Bob wants to play fair, he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll take it. Even though I'm getting less than I wanted, it's better than getting nothing due to inflation."
