"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the actual values are:

* My gain: $50 * 0.95 = $47.50
* Bob's gain: $50 * 0.80 = $40

I accept Bob's offer for the following reason: it's a fair and even split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing more value due to inflation.
