"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice a large share, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept in the first round.  It's a gamble, as if Bob rejects, the money will be worth less to Alice in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is worse for Alice than her offer in the first round, even after accounting for inflation. Alice should reject and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

Alice is now in a more advantageous position. Bob's offer in the previous round was unacceptable. Alice now offers a deal where she takes 60% of the money, knowing it will be worth slightly less for Bob in the next round.  This offer is fair in comparison to Bob's offer, but still gives Alice a decent advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still worse for Alice than her offer in round 3 after accounting for inflation. She should reject and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

Alice should offer a slightly higher share to Bob than in Round 3. This is to account for the significant inflation that has occurred. Bob is now losing value on his gains at a much faster rate than Alice.  This offer still gives Alice a good portion of the money, but it is a more balanced deal than the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Even though Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still worse than Alice's offer in Round 5 after accounting for inflation.  Alice should reject and hope for a better deal in the next round. Bob's gains are decreasing in value much faster than Alice's."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

With Bob's gains decreasing in value much faster than Alice's, she should offer a slightly higher share to him than in Round 5, but still ensure a significant portion for herself. This offer balances the risk of Bob accepting a lower offer in the next round with the possibility of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Even though Bob's offer is closer to an even split than his previous offers, it's still significantly less than Alice's offer in Round 7 after accounting for inflation. Alice should reject and hope for a better deal in the next round. At this point, Bob's gains are decreasing in value much faster than Alice's, and she is in a strong position to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

Alice should propose a similar offer to her initial offer in Round 1.  Since Bob has been rejecting offers that are increasingly favorable to him, Alice should try to leverage his desperation. Bob's gains are decreasing in value at a much faster rate than hers, and this offer will be a much better deal for him than his previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's the best deal Alice is likely to get at this point. Bob's gains are decreasing in value much faster than hers due to inflation, and he is likely to stick with this offer. 

Here's why Alice should accept:

* **Inflation:** The money Alice gains is worth significantly less now compared to the beginning, and it will continue to decrease. Bob's gains are decreasing even faster. 
* **Risk of Rejection:** If Alice rejects, she risks Bob offering a lower share in the next round. It's unlikely he'll be willing to give more than half at this point.
* **Even Split:** Although Alice would prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split is better than risking a worse outcome in the future.

While it's tempting to try for a better deal, accepting a 50/50 split is the safest and most rational choice in this scenario."
