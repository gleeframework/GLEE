{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."

# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and 70/30 is still a bit too skewed in his favor. I'll try to negotiate further!"

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob 25% of the money, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'm going to try to negotiate further and see if I can get a better deal."
