"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the remaining 2 rounds between us.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split, let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is worth 90% of $4,800 (10% less than the original $5,600 I would have gotten in the first round).

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 95% of $6,400 (5% less than the original $6,800 he would have gotten in the first round), but I'm not concerned about that.

I'll accept Bob's offer to end the game.
