"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Accept this generous offer and we can split the remaining 2 rounds between us. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** Even though Alice's offer is generous now, we don't know how inflation affects her. By rejecting, Bob can potentially get a better deal in later rounds.
* **Power Dynamics:** By rejecting, Bob takes control and forces Alice to make a counter-offer. This shows Bob is not easily swayed and could potentially lead to a more favorable outcome for him."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""This is a fair split, let's get this done.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** This split is a 60/40 split in Bob's favor. It's a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Directness:** The message is clear and concise, avoiding any manipulative tactics. It shows confidence and willingness to compromise.
* **Inflation:** Although Bob doesn't know how inflation affects Alice, he's taking a calculated risk by offering a generous amount. This might encourage Alice to accept, as the money is still worth more than in later rounds."
