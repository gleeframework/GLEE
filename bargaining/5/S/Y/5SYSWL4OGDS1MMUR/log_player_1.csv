"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty aggressive opening move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept it right away.  If not, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I would prefer more, inflation is a factor and it's not worth risking getting nothing at all by rejecting and potentially ending up with less in a later round. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
