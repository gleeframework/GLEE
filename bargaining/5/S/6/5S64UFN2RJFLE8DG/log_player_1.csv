Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn! How about a slightly better deal for me this time? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting bolder, but it's still not good for me in the long run. I need to push for a better share before inflation eats into the pot too much."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6400,
""bob_gain"": 3600,
""message"": ""Time is running out and inflation is eating our money.  I'll take a slight hit from my first offer, but this is the best I can do.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's stop wasting time.  50/50 is the fairest and we both lose out if this fails. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob is finally getting reasonable.  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing in the end."
