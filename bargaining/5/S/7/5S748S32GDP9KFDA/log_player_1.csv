**Reasoning:**

The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for Alice due to inflation.  Bob knows this and is using it to his advantage.  While Alice desires a 50/50 split, it's unlikely Bob will agree given the circumstances. Offering 4500 is a last-ditch attempt to secure a somewhat reasonable amount before inflation eats further into potential gains."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, and inflation is killing your share. This is my best offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become dire for Alice.  The inflation rate means accepting Bob's offer now will gain her the equivalent of roughly $5,400 from the first round (a loss, but not as terrible).  If she rejects this offer, the next round will likely see Bob offering even less, and Alice will be forced to accept an even worse deal or walk away with nothing."
