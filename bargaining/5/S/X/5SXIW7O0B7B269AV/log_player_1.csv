Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll make a counteroffer that's more in my favor:

Round 5

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

}

This offer is a bit riskier, but I think it's a good chance to get a better outcome for myself."
