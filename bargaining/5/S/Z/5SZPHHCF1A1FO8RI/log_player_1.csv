"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly and get out of this inflation nightmare!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 evenly, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take advantage of me in the first round, so I'll offer you a slightly better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since I'm getting 400,000 and Bob is getting 600,000, it seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me again! I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the inflation rate.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not satisfactory, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the inflation rates.

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a fair share!""}

I'm proposing that I get 420,000 and Bob gets 580,000. This is a slightly more generous offer than Bob's previous one, but still takes into account the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'm starting to think you're not serious about getting out of this inflation nightmare! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive!

Considering the inflation rates, my gain of 300,000 is actually worth even less than before, and Bob's gain of 700,000 is still a significant advantage.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I don't want to get stuck in an infinite loop of rejection. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will finally agree to a fair deal.
