"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take $600,000 and leave $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly higher share to Bob to make it more attractive, but still aiming to keep the majority for myself."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and I need to adjust my strategy. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. However, Bob's offer is similar to my previous offer, and I think I can do better.

  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is the same offer I made in the first round, but with the knowledge that the money is worth less now."
