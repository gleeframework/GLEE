"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're leaving too much on the table, I'm making a more generous offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain staying the same value, but Bob's gain being worth 5% less, I'm getting a better deal than in the previous round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
