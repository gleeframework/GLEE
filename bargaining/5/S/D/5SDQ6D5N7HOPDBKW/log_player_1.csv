"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but still offer you a decent amount.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

I'd rather not give up that much more to Bob, considering the inflation. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.
