Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the potential gains for Bob is rapidly decreasing. Waiting any longer will result in a significantly smaller reward, even if he manages to secure a slightly larger percentage in future rounds.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice is clearly aware of Bob's predicament and is steadily decreasing her offer. Holding out further is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from Alice.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries a substantial risk of getting nothing if a favorable agreement isn't reached in the remaining rounds. 

While 44% isn't ideal, it's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing later."
