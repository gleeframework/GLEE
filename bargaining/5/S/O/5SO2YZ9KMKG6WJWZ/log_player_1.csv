Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money evenly, but I'll take $60 and leave you $40 to incentivize you to accept. It's in both our best interests to avoid more rounds and inflation eating away at our money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
