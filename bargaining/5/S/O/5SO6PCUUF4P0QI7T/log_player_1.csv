"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself $90 and Bob $10.  This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
A 50/50 split is a fair offer. It's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round, so I'll accept."
