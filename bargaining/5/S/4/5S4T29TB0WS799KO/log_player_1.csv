"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to consider that. My gain is still worth the same as in Round 1, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 60-40, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's slightly more favorable to me. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain even more, I need to consider that his offer is actually more favorable to him than his previous offer. However, my gain is still worth the same as in Round 1. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer...

Wait a minute... Bob's offer is actually a 45-55 split, which is the same as my previous offer in Round 3! Given that inflation has made his gain worth even less, I think I should accept this offer.
