"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair game? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to maximize my gain. Splitting it evenly might not be the best deal for me, considering the inflation.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round and let Alice know my decision. I'm excited to see what she'll propose next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll aim a bit higher to compensate for the loss.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is fairer.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Alice accepts this offer or decides to proceed to the next round!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a more even split is fair. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although Alice is willing to compromise, the 52-48 split still doesn't fully account for the 9.75% decrease in value I'm experiencing due to inflation. I want to try to get a better deal to make up for this loss.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another counteroffer, taking into account the increasing effect of inflation on my gain. Since the money is now worth 9.75% less for me, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for this loss.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, I need a better deal.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Alice accepts this offer or decides to proceed to the next round!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go up to 45, but I don't want to lose out more to inflation.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my gain, which is now worth 18.55% less than in the first round, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. The 55-45 split is closer to what I was aiming for, and further negotiations might not yield a significantly better deal. Additionally, the increasing loss due to inflation with each passing round makes it riskier to continue. I'll accept this offer to secure the 55 dollars, even though it's worth less than initially.\n\n###\n\nLet Alice know I'm accepting her offer, and we can conclude the game!"
