"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me a slightly larger share, but still a generous offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the bigger share this time.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, the effective gains are:

* My gain: 45 * 0.95 = 42.75
* Bob's gain: 55

I'll consider Bob's offer. It's a bit more aggressive, but I'll think it's a fair deal given the current situation. I'll accept the offer.
