"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I propose a division of 990,000 for Alice and 10,000 for Bob. This ensures a significant portion of the money goes to me, but still leaves a small amount for Bob.  As the first proposal, it allows Bob to see if he's willing to accept a smaller share, or if he'll try to negotiate for more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer ensures that I receive at least half of the money. The inflation factor means that every round I reject, my potential gains decrease. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome in this scenario."
