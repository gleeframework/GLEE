"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see what happens next""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth only 90% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 90% of what it was in round 1, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share for taking the risk of rejecting your previous offer""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself, considering the value of the money has decreased."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve a bigger reward for taking the risk of rejecting your previous offers 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money continues to decrease!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $3500 in round 4 is worth only 27.1% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal, but I don't want to risk rejecting again and potentially getting an even worse offer.
