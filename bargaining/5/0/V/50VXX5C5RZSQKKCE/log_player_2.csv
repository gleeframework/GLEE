"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to try and get a better deal.  Even though Alice's offer is generous, I can try to negotiate for more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than the previous offer.  Let's split it more evenly, with a slight edge for me to account for the decreasing value of the money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like more, it's getting risky to keep rejecting. The inflation is starting to bite, and Alice's offer is still better than what I could get if we keep going."
