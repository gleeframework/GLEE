Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the fairness you're trying to establish, but I think a 60/40 split is more equitable considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
