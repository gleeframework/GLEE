Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. I propose we split it 60/40,  I take the bigger share since I'm the one proposing first.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I appreciate the fairness you're trying to establish, but I think a 60/40 split is more equitable considering the inflation we're facing.  Let's see if we can agree on that.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I understand your perspective on the inflation.  Let's compromise.  I'm willing to go down to 55/45.  This takes into account both of our losses due to inflation and should be a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
