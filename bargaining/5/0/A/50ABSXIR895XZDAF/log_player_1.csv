**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Inflation for Bob:** Bob's potential gain has been hit hard by inflation. He's likely feeling the pressure and this offer is closer to a 50/50 split than his previous one.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Rejecting this offer means another round with even less value for both of us. The potential gain from holding out is outweighed by the guaranteed loss from inflation.
* **Bob's Ultimatum:** Bob stating this is his final offer carries weight. There's a real risk he'll offer something much worse in a future round, or we'll be left with a paltry sum due to inflation. 

It's a tough call, but sometimes accepting a decent offer is better than risking a much worse outcome in a game of diminishing returns."
