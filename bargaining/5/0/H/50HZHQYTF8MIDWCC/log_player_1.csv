"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I would receive are:

* My gain: 300,000 / 0.95 = 315,789.47
* Bob's gain: 700,000 / 0.9 = 777,777.78

I'm not sure I like this offer. I'd rather negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less each round, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob! Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation effect:

* My gain: 450,000 / 0.859 (1 - 0.141) = 522,235.53
* Bob's gain: 550,000 / 0.727 (1 - 0.273) = 755,143.35

Hmm, it seems like Bob is trying to get more each round. I'm not sure I want to give him more than 40% of the remaining amount. I'll reject this offer.
