"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm leaving it up to Bob to decide whether to accept or propose a different split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now.

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair and even split, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing returns. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
