Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see we're getting closer, but I still think I can get a bit more. 58/42 is my new offer. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is right about us inching closer to a deal, his idea of ""a bit more"" is getting greedy with the inflated money. Accepting 42 now is a very bad deal compared to the 55 I proposed last round.  I need to show him I'm serious about not getting pushed around."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 56,
""bob_gain"": 44,
""message"": ""Bob, the money is losing value fast.  I'm offering 56/44 - it's a compromise, but we need to agree soon before we both lose out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but with urgency:** I'm slightly increasing my offer from 55 to 56, showing a willingness to compromise. However, I'm emphasizing the time pressure and the shrinking pot. 
* **Framing:** I'm framing my offer as a way to prevent mutual loss, appealing to Bob's rational side.  
* **Avoiding extremes:** I'm not going back to my original 60/40, as it might seem like I'm not taking the negotiations seriously.  This offer is a middle ground designed to get us to an agreement quickly."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I agree we need to settle soon, but I still think I can get a bit more. 57/43 is my new offer. Let's end this before the money is worthless. 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  Bob is right, the clock is ticking.  Another rejection and we're both looking at significantly reduced gains. 
* **Marginal difference:**  The difference between his 57 offer and my 56 counter-offer is pretty negligible at this point due to inflation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for one or two more dollars isn't worth the risk of walking away with nothing if Bob continues to play hardball. 

It's better to secure a decent amount now than to get greedy and potentially lose everything."
