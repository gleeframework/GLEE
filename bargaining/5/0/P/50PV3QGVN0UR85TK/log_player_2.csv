I'll start with a more favorable offer for myself, but still leave some room for negotiation.  Let's see how Alice reacts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is trying to lowball me, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I believe I can get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping to incentivize Alice to accept before the inflation cuts into our gains too deeply."
