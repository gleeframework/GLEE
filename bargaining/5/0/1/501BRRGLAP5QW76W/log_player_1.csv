I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure I have the advantage of knowing about the inflation, so I'll try to grab a large share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer.  While it seems like a bad deal, I know that I can still get a better share in the next round. I'm aware of the inflation, and I can use that to my advantage. Bob's offer is a sign he is trying to get the most he can out of the deal, so I'll keep pushing for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still pushing for a larger share, but I'm slightly reducing my demand to try and get Bob to accept.  I need to consider that he might be more resistant to accepting a 90/10 split again after rejecting it in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer.  While it's not the ideal outcome, it's a much better deal than the previous round. Bob's offer is close to the 90/10 split I initially proposed, and given the significant inflation on his side, I'm likely to get a smaller share in the next round.  I'll take the $2000 and end this game."
