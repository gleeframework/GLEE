"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me taking the larger share since the money depreciates faster for me. Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your rate of depreciation is far worse than mine. I need a larger share to make this worthwhile in the long run. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation rate is making this deal less favorable with each passing round. It's better to take what I can get before the value drops even further."
