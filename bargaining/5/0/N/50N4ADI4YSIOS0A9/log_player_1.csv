"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see if Bob agrees or wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 40 is more than nothing, it's still a very unequal split, and I'm confident I can do better.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a more balanced split, and it reflects my improved position after Bob's unsuccessful attempt at a 60/40 split. I hope he'll accept this fair offer."
