Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  Bob's share is rapidly devaluing. Even though he's asking for 55%, it's worth significantly less than in earlier rounds.
* **Time Pressure:** Every round that passes without an agreement means a loss for both players.
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. He might become even more resistant to a less favorable split.

Accepting $450,000 now is better than risking a worse outcome later, especially considering the decreasing value of the total pot for Bob."
