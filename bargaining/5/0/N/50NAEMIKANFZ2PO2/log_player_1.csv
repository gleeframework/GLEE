Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to get most of the money in the first round.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in later rounds.  It's a fair split and we'll both get a decent amount."
