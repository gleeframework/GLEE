Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob.  I'm aiming for a significant share early on, knowing the money will depreciate faster for me in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is hitting me hard. It's better to accept this offer and secure a gain, even if it's less than I originally hoped for."
