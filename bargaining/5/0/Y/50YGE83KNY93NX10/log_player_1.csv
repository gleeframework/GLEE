"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'd like to get a larger share, considering the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering the inflation is still affecting me, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close to the edge, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but not quite there! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting the offer because, although I'd like to get a larger share, the money I gain is worth significantly less due to inflation, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with an even smaller share."
