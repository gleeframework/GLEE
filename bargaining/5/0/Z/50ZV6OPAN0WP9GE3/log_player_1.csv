Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good balance between our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, given the inflationary pressure. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's compromise and split it 50-50, considering the inflationary pressure""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more equal division considering the effects of inflation. I think this is a fair compromise, and it's a good opportunity for us to find a mutually beneficial solution."
