"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is 50-50, it's a fair split, but considering the inflation, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings! Given the decreasing value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

Since Bob's offer is still a 48-52 split, it's not significantly different from the previous offers. Considering the inflation, I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
