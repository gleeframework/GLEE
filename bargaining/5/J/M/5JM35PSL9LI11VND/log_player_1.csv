Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, considering I'm already at a disadvantage due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the growing inflation disadvantage, I'm adjusting the split slightly in my favor while still trying to be fair. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is framing his offer as a concession, it's important to remember the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for him, not for me. Holding out for a better offer that acknowledges this disparity is still the stronger strategy."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 512500,
""bob_gain"": 487500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer takes the inflation into account while still being beneficial for both of us.  It's time to close the deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm slightly adjusting my offer in this round. While I still hold a strong position, I recognize the need to keep Bob engaged.  This offer represents a small concession from my previous position but ensures a larger gain than his last offer. The message emphasizes the urgency of the situation due to inflation, prompting Bob to seriously consider accepting."
