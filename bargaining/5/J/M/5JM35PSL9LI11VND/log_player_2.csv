Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer takes the inflation into account while still being beneficial for both of us.  It's time to close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 487500 
# Alice gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant impact of inflation at this point and Alice's adjusted offer, which seems to acknowledge my disadvantage, I think it's wise to accept this deal before the value decreases further.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nIt seems like a fair adjustment given the circumstances, and further rounds would only decrease my gain's value."
