# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll decide to...

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, I'm taking control now! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite aggressive! I'm not thrilled about the 15/85 split, and the fact that I'll be getting a relatively small share of the pie.

However, considering the effects of inflation, I'm not sure if I can afford to be too picky. I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

I'll decide to...

I'm offering a 20/80 split, trying to find a compromise that's still somewhat reasonable. I'm hoping Bob will consider this offer and meet me in the middle."
