"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a small share.  It's a risky move, but I'm hoping to see if he's willing to accept a small gain early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's a fair split and I'm not sure how the inflation will affect future rounds.  It's best to secure a decent share now."
