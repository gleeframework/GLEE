"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer is a starting point. I want to keep most of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a small share to hopefully get him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While Bob is offering a much larger share of the money to me, I'm still holding out for more. I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, but still keeping the majority for myself. I believe this is a fair offer given the inflation and the fact that I will be making the offer in the next round if he rejects this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer. Bob's share is worth significantly less due to inflation, and while I would have liked to have gotten more, I believe this is the best I can do. Accepting will end the game and I will get half the money."
