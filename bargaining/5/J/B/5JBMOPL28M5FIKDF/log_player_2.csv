Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of value, last chance 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice knows I'm desperate at this point. If I reject this offer, the value will plummet even further, and she's likely to offer me even less in the next round. Taking $3000 now is better than risking a worse outcome."
