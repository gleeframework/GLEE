Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit greedy, don't you think? I'm proposing a 60/40 split. Let's be reasonable.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a 70/30 split is more fair, considering the inflation affecting your side. Let's reach an agreement before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering a compromise, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more desperate I become due to inflation, and she knows it. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth isn't helping either of us.  I'm proposing a straight 50/50 split. It's the fairest option and ensures we both benefit. Let's end this now before inflation eats away at my share further.""}"
