"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and equal starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slight majority, but we can still talk. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider the relative values.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a slightly more balanced split, as I feel you're taking a larger share than I'm comfortable with.""
}
```"

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the money he gains being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, his offer of 80 is actually equivalent to a much smaller share than it initially seemed.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. My message to Bob is:
