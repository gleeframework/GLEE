"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which I think is a generous offer. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a fair deal and that he should accept it. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, I'm feeling generous but let's wrap this up quickly. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $550,000 is actually equivalent to $495,000 in the first round. Considering I initially offered Bob 40% of the money, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Come on, Bob, let's meet in the middle!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than my initial offer, while still trying to maximize my own gain. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable compromise and that we should settle on this division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
