Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 6000

While the inflation is hitting me hard, I'm getting less than what I originally offered Bob, and his offer is still better than if we continue to the next round. It's time to take the deal."
