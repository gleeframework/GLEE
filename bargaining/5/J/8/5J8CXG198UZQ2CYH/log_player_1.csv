Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. I want to maximize my share in the first round, knowing that the money will be worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money.  Since inflation affects me more heavily,  the risk of getting nothing in later rounds is too high."
