"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll take 60, you take 40.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair and equal division of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I need some too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I like the sound of Bob giving me ""most of it"" - that's a pretty vague offer!

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's not very specific, Bob. I'd like a more concrete offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to kick in, and my $100 is now worth less than before!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's compromise, Bob. I'll take 55, you take 45. It's still a fair split.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous this time, offering Bob a slightly larger share. Hopefully, he'll accept this offer and we can move on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I'm getting desperate! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's getting desperate, huh? I'm not sure I like the sound of that...

I'll reject this offer, but I'll try to make a slightly more generous offer of my own:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give you most of it, Bob. Here's a better offer: 50-50 split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. 45 for me, 55 for you. Let's wrap this up!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but I'm not giving away too much. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer and we can finally end the game!"
