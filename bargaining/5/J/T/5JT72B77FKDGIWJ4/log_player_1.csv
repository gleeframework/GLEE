I'm starting with a relatively even split, giving myself a slight advantage since the inflation affects Bob more. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting less than I offered in the first round, I'm still getting a decent amount. Also, since the inflation hits Bob harder, it's unlikely he'll offer me more in the next round."
