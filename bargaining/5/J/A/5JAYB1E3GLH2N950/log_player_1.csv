"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, which means I'd get $8,000 and Bob would get $2,000. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair and square split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my calculations.

In the first round, I was proposing $8,000 for myself, which is now worth 90% of its original value due to inflation. So, in this round, $8,000 is equivalent to $7,200.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which means I'd get $5,000 and Bob would get $5,000. Since $5,000 is more than the equivalent of $7,200 in the first round, I'd be better off accepting this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
