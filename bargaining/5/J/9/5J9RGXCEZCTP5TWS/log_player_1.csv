"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant amount, and I'll take $600,000. I've included a message, ""Let's be reasonable,"" to convey that this is a fair and generous offer, considering we're trying to find a mutually acceptable division. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his claim of being generous, the division he's proposing is still not as favorable to me as my initial offer was to him. Given that the value of the money remains the same for me but decreases for Bob with each round, I have an incentive to hold out for a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a more acceptable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my share to $650,000 and offering Bob $350,000. Given that the money's value decreases by 10% for Bob with each round, the actual value he receives is less than the nominal value. My message, ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair,"" aims to highlight this point and persuade Bob that, in real terms, this offer is more generous than it seems at first glance. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his claim that this is his final offer, the division he's proposing is still not as favorable to me as I believe I can achieve. Given that the value of the money remains the same for me but has decreased significantly for Bob due to inflation (now worth 27.1% less than in the first round), I have a strong incentive to hold out for a better deal. Bob's assertive message, ""Take it or leave it,"" suggests he's trying to pressure me into accepting, but I'm not convinced this is the best offer I can get. Let's see how the game unfolds further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Inflation is on my side""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my share to $700,000 and offering Bob $300,000. The message, ""Inflation is on my side,"" is intended to remind Bob that with each passing round, the real value of the money he receives decreases, while the value remains constant for me. This dynamic gives me a significant advantage in negotiations, and I'm leveraging that to propose a division that's increasingly favorable to me. Given Bob's previous assertiveness, I'm interested in seeing how he'll respond to this offer."
