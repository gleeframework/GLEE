"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on you, my offer is relatively generous. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Each round hurts your buying power more, I'm being reasonable given the situation. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my rapidly devaluing position. While it's tempting to take a decreasing offer, I need to hold strong for a bit longer. Accepting this sets a bad precedent and she's likely to keep lowballing me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I need to secure a reasonable amount. This offer is a compromise, and accepting it benefits us both by avoiding further inflation losses.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation difference is getting extreme, I'm being more than fair at this point. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. The value of my potential gains is plummeting with every round. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, rejecting it risks even further losses from inflation, potentially leaving me with a pittance in the final rounds. It's better to secure something now than risk getting almost nothing later."
