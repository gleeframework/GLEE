"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I receive $400,000 and Bob receives $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

With the new offer, I'd be getting $300,000, which is worth 80% of what I could have gotten in the first round. That's a decent deal, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80%). I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 230000,
  ""bob_gain"": 770000
}
```"
