"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3 to start, then we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. I'm framing it as a starting point, suggesting we can adjust in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% and leave you with 40% for now, let's see if you'll accept 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll be getting $400,000, which is $280,000 in the first round's value.

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 20% less than in the second round, so I'll be getting 20% of $400,000, which is $80,000.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50:50 now that we've seen each other's moves. It's time to be fair.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50:50 split, suggesting we divide the remaining money equally between us."
