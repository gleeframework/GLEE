"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, with me getting 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than before, so I need to be cautious. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a bit more equal than my initial offer, but still not as favorable to me as I would like.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and tries to get a better deal for myself. Since the money is worth 40% less than in Round 1, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still relatively close to a 50-50 split to keep the negotiations going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate of 48.8% less than the first round, my potential gain is worth significantly less than before. Bob's offer is now a 40-60 split, which is actually more favorable to him than my previous offer.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer to get something rather than risking further erosion of the value.
