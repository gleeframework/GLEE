Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was tempting, Alice, but fairness swings both ways. I'm proposing a slight advantage for me this round. Let's settle this quickly and avoid inflation eating into our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
