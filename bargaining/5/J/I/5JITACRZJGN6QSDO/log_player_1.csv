"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's a good idea to accept an offer that gives Bob 80% of the total amount. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a more balanced split""}

I'm proposing that I get 45% of the total amount, which is $450,000, and Bob gets 55%, which is $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer at all. The consolation prize of $100,000 is not even 10% of the original amount, and Bob is getting the majority of the money. I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

I'm proposing that I get 30% of the total amount, which is $300,000, and Bob gets 70%, which is $700,000."
