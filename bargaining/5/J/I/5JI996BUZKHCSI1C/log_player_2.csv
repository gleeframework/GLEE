**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, accepting now means Bob is losing a significant amount of potential earnings due to inflation.  He needs to push Alice closer to a 50/50 split, or even slightly in his favor, considering the inflation disadvantage he faces."
