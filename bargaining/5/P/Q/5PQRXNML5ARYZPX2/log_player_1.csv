"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Take 20% and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. A 40-60 split is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, my gain of $600,000 is worth 80% of the original amount, which is $800,000, and Bob's gain of $400,000 is worth 80% of the original amount, which is $320,000.

I'm not sure I want to accept a 40-60 split. I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob! But I think I deserve a bit more. Take 45% and we can talk.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the current value of the money, which is $550,000, and Bob gets 45%, which is $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. A 50-50 split is a fair and reasonable offer. Let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing its value quickly! With the new values, my gain of $500,000 is worth 50% of the original amount, which is $500,000, and Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 50% of the original amount, which is $500,000.

A 50-50 split is a reasonable offer, and I'm not sure I can do better. I'll accept this offer.
