{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need more than $40 to make it worthwhile for me. Let's split it $55 for me, $45 for you.  This takes into account the inflation, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is working against you, but I need a larger share. I'll take my previous offer of $55. It's your last chance to get $45 before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
