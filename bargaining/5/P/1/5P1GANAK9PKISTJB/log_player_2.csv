Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share.  However, continuing this back and forth only hurts us both due to inflation.  Let's settle this fairly with a 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
