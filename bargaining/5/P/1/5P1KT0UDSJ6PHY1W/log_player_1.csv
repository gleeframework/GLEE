"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, Alice.  I'm offering a deal that benefits us both, given the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to flip the script!

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually the same as my initial offer, but with the labels swapped. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'd be getting $4800 (20% less than $6000) and Bob would be getting $5700 (5% less than $6000).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, considering the changed circumstances. I'd like to propose a new deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Given the inflation, I'm offering a slightly more conservative split. Let's meet in the middle.""
