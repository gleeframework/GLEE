"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept a ""fair"" split, but it's important to consider the inflation rate.  Since the money is worth less to Alice than to me, she's likely to make a better offer in the next round.  Let's see what she proposes."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script, Alice.  I'm offering a deal that benefits us both, given the inflation rates.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, I'm offering a slightly more conservative split. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is closer to my initial desire for a more even split, and with the inflation considered, it's a decent deal.  Accepting this ensures I get a larger share than what I initially rejected."
