750000.0,250000.0,I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the inflation rates.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is fair given the inflation rates and we can both walk away with a good share.,Bob,2,
