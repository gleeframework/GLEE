"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation impact on my end. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's just the first round, and I'm not in a hurry to accept 40 dollars when I could potentially get more. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think we should divide it more evenly.""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn! Since Alice's money is worth 10% less each round, I'm willing to offer her a bit less than half, while also taking into account that my own money is worth 5% less. Let's see how she reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more, and I need a larger share to compensate. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is a fair offer, considering the inflation impact on both of us. Alice's money is worth 19% less now, so her 55 dollars is actually less valuable than it seems. Meanwhile, my 45 dollars is only worth 9.75% less. I think I'm getting a relatively good deal here, and since Alice says it's her final offer, I don't want to risk losing everything by pushing for more. Time to accept and walk away with 45 dollars!"
