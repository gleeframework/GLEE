"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it seems like a reasonable and fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to give you a decent amount, let's see if you'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of $300,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to $240,000 in the first round's value.

Bob's offer seems decent, but I'm not sure if I want to give up so much control in the negotiation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my offer will be slightly more aggressive, considering the inflation. Since my share is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 80%), I'll aim to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more this round!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being generous this round, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, my share of $200,000 is worth 44.8% of what it was in the first round (100% * 0.488), which is equivalent to $448,000 in the first round's value. Considering the significant drop in value, I'm not sure if I want to accept such a small share.

However, Bob's message seems confident, and I don't want to risk missing out on any potential gains. I'll take a chance and accept this offer.
