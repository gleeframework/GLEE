"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, my friend!""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share, and I get a slight edge, but it's still a reasonable offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm not feeling generous 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of 70 is actually 56 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather get a slightly larger share, so I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my gain of 56 in the first round's value is now worth 44.8 in this round's value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time, but I'm still trying to get a slight edge. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is getting worse! My gain of 55 in the first round's value is now worth 28.4 in this round's value.

Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving him 75. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so my gain of 28.4 in the previous round's value is now worth 14.8 in this round's value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 20,
  ""bob_gain"": 80,
  ""message"": ""I'm being generous, Bob, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money and make a more modest proposal."
