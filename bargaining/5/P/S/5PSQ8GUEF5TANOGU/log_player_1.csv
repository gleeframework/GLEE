"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Bob a small portion of the money, but it is a starting point. I believe it is in my best interest to offer him something to get the ball rolling, considering the money depreciates for me with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I understand the value of my money is depreciating, accepting this offer would mean losing almost all of the money. It's better to hold out and see what happens in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my offer for Bob to 200,000. This is still a significant amount for him, and I'm hoping it will encourage him to accept, as the money I receive is worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm losing value on my money quickly, this offer still feels extremely unfair. It's worth holding out for a better deal, especially since there are several rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer for Bob again, to 300,000. This is a substantial amount for him, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the dwindling value of my money. I'm hoping this will finally convince him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the value of my money is decreasing significantly, I can't accept this offer yet. It still heavily favors Bob, and I'm holding out hope for a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to find a middle ground. 600,000 for me and 400,000 for Bob seems like a reasonable compromise, especially considering the decreasing value of my money. I'm feeling the pressure of time, so I'm making a bold move."
