"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight advantage for me, but still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the $4000 I would gain in this round is equivalent to $4000 / 0.9 = $4444.44 in the first round. Still a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 60/40 split.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to balance the scales""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, trying to get a bit more for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a reasonable offer 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up quickly! The $3500 I would gain in this round is equivalent to $3500 / 0.713 (1 - 0.287 = 0.713) = $4921.43 in the first round. Still a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 65/35 split.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Back to a 50/50 split, no advantage for either of us""
}
```

I'm proposing another 50/50 split, trying to get back to a fair and neutral offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
