"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal.  I take $700,000, you take $300,000. This ensures we both benefit from the money now rather than risking its value diminishing over multiple rounds. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000

""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable: I propose a 47.5% / 52.5% split. This ensures you still receive a larger share while acknowledging the time-value of the money for both of us.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but it still heavily favors you in the long run. Let's be practical. I propose a 65/35 split.  This recognizes the decreasing value of the money over time while still offering you a substantial sum.

# Alice gain: 650000
