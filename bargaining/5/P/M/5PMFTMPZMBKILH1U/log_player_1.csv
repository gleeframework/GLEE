"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400,000
* Bob gain: 600,000

Considering the initial offer was 50/50, and Bob is now offering me 40% and himself 60%, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still hoping for a fair deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still trying to negotiate a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 48.8% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 480,000
* Bob gain: 520,000

Considering the previous offers, I think this one is a bit closer to a 50/50 split, but still slightly biased towards Bob. I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise.
