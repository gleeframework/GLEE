"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 600,000 and Bob takes 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think this is a fair starting point for me. I was willing to compromise in the first round, and now Bob is trying to take a larger share. I'd like to make a new proposal to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, where I take 520,000 and Bob takes 480,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's more favorable to me, but still reasonable."
