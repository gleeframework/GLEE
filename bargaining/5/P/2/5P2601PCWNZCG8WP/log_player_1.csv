Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive offer.  I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, as the inflation will make it less valuable in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing due to inflation in later rounds."
