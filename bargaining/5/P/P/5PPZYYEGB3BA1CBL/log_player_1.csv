"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 80 for me, 20 for you. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $80 and Bob getting $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice. Let's share it 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll actually get $45 (50 * 0.9) if we accept this offer.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 50/50 split, as I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of money due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll propose a slightly higher share for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll take 55 and leave 45 for you. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, Alice. 60 for me, 40 for you. It's a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Let's calculate the actual amounts I'd receive if we accept this offer:

* My share: 40 * 0.513 (since the money is worth 53.1% of its original value) = 20.52
* Bob's share: 60 * 0.515 (since the money is worth 51.5% of its original value) = 30.9

Considering the reduced value of money, I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to accept it since it's still a compromise.
