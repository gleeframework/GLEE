"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money, and I'll take the rest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll consider the value of the money in terms of its original value.

In the first round, Bob would have received $20, which is worth $16 in the second round. Now, he's offering me $50, which is equivalent to $40 in the first round.

I think this is a fair offer, considering the money is worth less for Bob. I'll accept the offer.
