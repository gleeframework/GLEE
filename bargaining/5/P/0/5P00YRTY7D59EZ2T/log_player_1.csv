"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $6,000 and keeping $4,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, the actual amounts I'd gain are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56
* Bob's gain: 5000

I'll accept this offer.
