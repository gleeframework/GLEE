Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the significant impact of inflation on your potential gains, 30 is a more than fair offer at this point. It's better for you to take this now rather than risk further devaluation. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
 
It's painful, but at this point, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. The relentless inflation means any further rounds will result in an even smaller share for me. While 30 isn't ideal, it's better than holding out for a slightly better offer and getting stuck with even less."
