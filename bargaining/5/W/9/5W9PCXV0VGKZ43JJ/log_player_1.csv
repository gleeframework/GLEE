"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to try and secure as much of the money as possible for myself in the first round, while still offering Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, the inflation means my share is shrinking with each round. Taking 6000 now is better than risking a smaller amount later."
