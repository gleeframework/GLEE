Let's see what Alice offers next. It might be better to wait and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. Even though it's a 50/50 split, the inflation has significantly decreased the value of Alice's share.  This is a decent outcome for me considering the risk of getting nothing at all."
