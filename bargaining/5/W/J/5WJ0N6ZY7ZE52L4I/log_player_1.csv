"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering you 30 dollars, and I'll take 70 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll consider the actual amount I'll get is 40 * 0.8 = 32 dollars.

I'll accept this offer.
