"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in the second round, I need to consider the equivalent value of $500,000 in the first round, which is $500,000 / 0.9 = $555,555.56.

With this in mind, I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer since I can get a higher value in the next round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the second round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Since the money is worth 10% less each round, I'll aim to keep a larger share of the remaining amount. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of my gain in the first round, considering the 27.1% reduction in value.

$400,000 / 0.721 = $555,277.78

Since this is lower than my previous offer, I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
