"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This is a fair starting offer. It's possible that Bob might accept it, but if he rejects, we can start strategizing based on the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is not very fair, especially considering the inflation rates. Even with the discount, I am getting a significantly lower share. I will reject and make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly from the previous round, but still offer a relatively fair split. It's important to find a balance between being assertive and ensuring that Bob doesn't completely shut down the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering a significantly lower share than what I consider fair, even with the discounted values. I will continue to reject his offers and make a counter-proposal in the next round.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to find a balance between getting a good share and avoiding a stalemate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}
```

I'm going to increase my share again, but still keep it reasonable considering the inflation rates.  Bob has rejected several offers now, so it's time to show him that I'm not afraid to push back. However, I'm trying to maintain a balance between my desire for a better deal and avoiding a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair, especially considering the inflation rates. I'm going to keep rejecting his offers and try to push for a more equitable split in the next round.  The inflation is becoming more serious, so I need to find a balance between being assertive and avoiding a stalemate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going to go back to the original 50/50 split. Bob has rejected several of my offers, and inflation is making the situation worse. I think going back to a fair, equal split might be the best way to ensure we reach an agreement before the money becomes worthless."
