"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

Alice gain: 400000 * 0.9 = 360000
Bob gain: 600000 * 0.95 = 570000

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
