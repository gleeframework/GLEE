Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept.  I'll take the majority of the money, but still give him a decent share.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, this is a fair offer.  It's better to get $5,000 than risk getting nothing at all in the next round.  It's a good compromise!"
