"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. It's a fair split, don't you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's settle this! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, my gain of $8,000 is still $8,000, but Bob's gain of $2,000 is now worth $1,800.

I'm not willing to meet Bob halfway just yet. I'll stick to my original plan to maximize my gain. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to meet in the middle, I'll try to take advantage of the inflation and make a new offer that's even more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You should take this offer, Bob, before it's too late!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, but don't think you're getting off that easy! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, my gain of $8,000 is still $8,000, but Bob's gain of $2,000 is now worth $1,464.80.

I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since my gain is still $8,000, which is a significant amount, I'll accept this offer.
