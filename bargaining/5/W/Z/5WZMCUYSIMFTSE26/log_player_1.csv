"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, the total amount of money is $9,500 ($10,000 - 5% = $9,500).

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $4,000, which is worth 4,000 / 0.95 = $4,210.53 in the original amount (before inflation).

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll consider it. I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me again, the total amount of money is now $9,000 ($9,500 - 5% = $9,000).

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to get a fair share""
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a slightly better deal, while still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much more 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is catching up!

In this round, the total amount of money is $8,500 ($10,000 - 14.26% = $8,600, but I'll use $8,500 for simplicity).

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $3,500, which is worth 3,500 / 0.8585 (1 - 0.1415) = $4,070.11 in the original amount (before inflation).

I'm not getting a great deal, but I'll consider it. I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 19.51% less for me again, the total amount of money is now $8,000 ($8,500 - 5% = $8,100, but I'll use $8,000 for simplicity).

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a balance, but I need a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm trying to give Bob a decent amount, but I'm also trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll!

In this round, the total amount of money is $7,600 ($10,000 - 22.62% = $7,770, but I'll use $7,600 for simplicity).

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $3,000, which is worth 3,000 / 0.7729 (1 - 0.2271) = $3,888.35 in the original amount (before inflation).

I'm not getting a great deal, but I'm running out of time. I'll accept the offer, hoping that Bob will stick to his word.
