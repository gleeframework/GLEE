Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but this offer is my final one.  Each round is hurting both of us, so let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice states this is her final offer, she has little incentive to actually refuse anything in later rounds.  The longer the game goes on, the more favorable the split becomes for her. It's highly likely she'll continue to play to maximize her gains. Bob needs to hold out for a better offer, even if it means going into later rounds."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer. This offer is fair given the current inflation, and we can avoid risking losing everything. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, a 50/50 split at this stage is a reasonable outcome for Bob.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game goes on, the more Bob loses to inflation. Accepting now secures a reasonable sum.
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice is unlikely to go much lower than a 50/50 split at this point. Her strategy likely involves maximizing her gain while ensuring a deal is reached.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a marginally better deal in later rounds carries a significant risk of getting nothing at all if an agreement isn't reached. 

Accepting a 50/50 split guarantees a decent payout and avoids the risk of walking away empty-handed."
