Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share and avoid any further risk of losing money.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, Alice, but I still need to get a fair share. Let's be reasonable and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
Let's break down why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're getting closer to the deadline, which is Bob's advantage. He knows my offers will get less appealing as time goes on due to inflation.
* **Minimum Acceptable Amount:** Even with inflation, I need to aim for a significantly better outcome than $450,000. My goal should be to stay above 50% of the initial offer while it's still feasible. 

**Strategy:**

My rejections are designed to signal that I'm serious about getting a better deal. I'm willing to risk going further into the game to see if Bob will crack and offer something more favorable."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's stop wasting time. This is my final offer. Take it or watch your potential winnings shrink even further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Pressure:** By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm shifting the pressure onto Bob. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I've come down to a 50/50 split of the original offer, which might appear more appealing to him now.
* **Urgency:** Emphasizing the shrinking pot adds urgency for Bob to accept before the deal potentially worsens for him in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's compromise and split the difference from my last offer. This will save us both from further losses. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling Bob's Bluff:** Bob's talking about ""both losing money,"" but he's unaffected by inflation. This is likely a tactic to pressure me.
* **Maintaining a Strong Stance:**  Accepting this offer would show weakness and likely lead to worse offers in the future. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  While the clock is ticking, I'm betting that Bob will become more willing to negotiate a fairer deal as we approach the final rounds."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time. This is the best you'll get. Don't let greed lead us to walk away with nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Mirroring and Countering:** I'm mirroring Bob's tactic from Round 6 by making it seem like a concession while actually flipping the amounts to my advantage. 
* **Strong Language:**  Using phrases like ""best you'll get"" and ""greed"" adds weight to the offer and implies he's being unreasonable.
* **Time Pressure:** Reminding him of the dwindling time is crucial at this stage to push him towards a decision. 

**It's a gamble, but at this point, I need to take control of the negotiation and force Bob's hand.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we both need to be realistic now.  The longer we wait, the more we lose. This offer is a fair compromise, and it's the best chance we have to walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pattern Recognition:** Bob is reverting back to his previous offers. This suggests he might be stuck in a pattern and not willing to move much further. 
* **High Stakes:** We are now in a critical danger zone. While the risk of getting nothing is very real, accepting this offer would be a significant loss compared to my goal.
* **Final Push:** This rejection is a calculated gamble to push Bob towards a more favorable deal in the very last rounds. He might be holding out, but the increasing pressure could make him reconsider. 

**The next couple of rounds are going to be extremely tense. I'm hoping my persistent rejections will finally make Bob crack.**"

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, it's now or never. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Don't let our greed ruin this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ultimate Bluff:** I'm returning to the ""final offer"" tactic, but this time with the most straightforward split. This creates a sense of urgency and finality. 
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  While I know Bob is primarily motivated by self-interest, invoking fairness at this late stage might make him reconsider his stubbornness. 
* **High Risk, High Reward:** It's a risky move, but with only a few rounds left, I'm betting that Bob will prefer to secure half the money rather than risk losing everything by sticking to his guns.

**This is the climax of the negotiation. It all hinges on Bob's response now.**"
