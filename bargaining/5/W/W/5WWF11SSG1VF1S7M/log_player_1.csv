"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the value of the money decreases more for Alice. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob's point about the value of money decreasing more for me due to inflation. However, I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on the split, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable adjustment for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to 55/45, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
