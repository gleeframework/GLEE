Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts pressure on me, but your offer was much too low. Let's be reasonable: I take 60%, you take 40%. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
