"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward division of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to calculate the actual value of Bob's gain in the first round to compare.

In the first round, Bob's gain was $5000. With 5% inflation, that's $5000 * 0.95 = $4750.

So, Bob's offer in the second round is equivalent to $4750 in the first round.

My gain in the second round is $4000, which is equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to Bob's previous offer, still a fair deal!""
}
```

I've increased my gain by $500, which is a 12.5% increase from Bob's previous offer, and decreased Bob's gain by $500, which is a 8.3% decrease from his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not giving up yet. This is my best offer so far! 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of Bob's gain in the first round, considering the 14.26% inflation.

Bob's gain in the first round was $5000. With 14.26% inflation, that's $5000 * 0.8537 = $4271.85.

So, Bob's offer in the fourth round is equivalent to $4271.85 in the first round.

My gain in the fourth round is $4600, which is equivalent to $4600 in the first round.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is a bit more attractive now. I'll accept it.
