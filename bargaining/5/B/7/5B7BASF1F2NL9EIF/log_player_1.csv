"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to start, fair and square!""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 and can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous just yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $4,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's $6,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to get a higher amount in this round to compensate for the decreased value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a bit more than Bob's previous offer, but still leave some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the current value of money, I need to think carefully about this offer. My $4,800 is worth about 38.4% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's $5,200 is worth about 92.5% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think about it...
