Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking 60% and you taking 40%.  It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid the risk of further inflation.

# Alice gain: 600000
