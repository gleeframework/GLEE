"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 75/25 in my favor.  While inflation will affect both of us, I'm willing to share more than Alice's initial offer. Let's make this a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
