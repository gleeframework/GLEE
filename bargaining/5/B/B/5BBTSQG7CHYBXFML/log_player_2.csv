"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 5% decrease in value isn't too bad, and I'm hoping Alice will be more generous next time to avoid losing even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's still somewhat generous, but takes into account the decreased value of money for both of us. Since Alice loses more value each round, I'll try to find a balance that might appeal to her.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering we both lose value each round, let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for us in this game! Let's settle this. This is a slight improvement on your previous offer, and it benefits us both to agree now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Given the decreasing value of money for both of us, but especially for Alice, I think this is a reasonable compromise. The longer we go on, the less we'll both get in real terms, and I don't want to risk ending up with significantly less than what's offered here.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
