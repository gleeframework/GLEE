"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer and see what Alice proposes next.  I'm hoping for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
``` 
I propose an even split of $5,000 each.  Let's be fair and avoid any further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice has increased my share slightly, it's still not a fair split. I'll reject this offer and see if she's willing to come closer to a 50/50 split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800}
``` 

I'll offer Alice $4,800 and keep $5,200 for myself.  I'm willing to give her a slight edge, but I'm not going to budge much further from a 50/50 split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4605 
# Alice gain: 5395 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still not offering a fair split. I'm going to keep rejecting these offers until she comes closer to a 50/50 split. The value of the money is declining with each round, so I need to make sure I get a good deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to stick with my original proposal of an even split.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm not willing to give away any more of my share. I hope Alice finally realizes that this is the most fair and logical solution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Finally!  Alice has come to her senses and offered a fair split.  I'll accept this offer and avoid any further inflation risks."
