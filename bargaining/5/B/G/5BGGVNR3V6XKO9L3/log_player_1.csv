"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
