"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the money will depreciate further in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the impact of inflation on the money's value for both players.
Inflation affects Bob's gain by reducing its value by 5% each round, while Alice's gain remains unaffected.

### Step 2: Consider the offers made in previous rounds and the strategic implications.
In Round 1, Alice offered a 60/40 split, which Bob rejected. In Round 2, Bob offered a 55/45 split, considering the depreciation of money, which Alice rejected.

### Step 3: Determine a new offer that takes into account the previous rejections and the effect of inflation.
Given that the money's value decreases by 5% for Bob each round, and considering the previous offers, Alice should make an offer that is slightly more favorable to Bob than her initial offer but does not compromise her gain significantly.

### Step 4: Calculate the offer.
Alice could offer a split that is slightly more generous than her first offer but still favorable to her, considering the strategic advantage of the game's structure.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer in the required JSON format.
Given the considerations above, Alice's new offer could be a 58/42 split, aiming to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob, given the depreciation of the money's value for him.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the depreciation, this is a fairer split.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
