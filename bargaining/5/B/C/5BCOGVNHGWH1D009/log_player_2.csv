Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your ambition, but I'm not sure 55/45 is fair.  Let's compromise: 52/48 in my favor.  It's a fair split considering the inflation, and we can move on to more important things. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation by framing the inflation as a bigger factor than it is for me. While she is losing value, it's not a significant enough difference at this stage to warrant a 52/48 split in her favor. I'm aiming for a larger share, and I'm willing to push a bit further to see if I can get it."
