"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. My message to Bob is ""Let's start with a fair split""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly this time.  I think a 60/40 split is fair. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less for me now.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
