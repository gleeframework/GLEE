"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** The money is worth less now, and Bob's gains are impacted more heavily (36% less). 
* **Alice's offer:** While the offer still favors Alice, it's a significant improvement on her previous proposal (460,000 vs 400,000 for Bob). 
* **Risk:** Rejecting the offer means Bob will have to propose in the next round, but the inflation effect will further diminish the value of the money. It's a calculated risk, but accepting this offer secures a decent amount of money."
