Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, Bob, but I believe we can find a fairer split. This offer gives you a decent share while ensuring I'm not losing out too much.  Let's work together to find a solution.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair share. This offer takes into account the inflation affecting your earnings, while still leaving you with a substantial amount. Let's find a middle ground and end this game amicably. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is right about finding a middle ground, this offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the accelerating inflation I'm facing.  It's time to show I'm serious about getting a better deal, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm sticking with a 50/50 split. This is non-negotiable. Accept now, or the effects of inflation will hurt us both.""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to play hardball.  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. By offering a firm 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating I'm willing to risk everything to avoid an unfair deal.  

* **Time pressure:**  We are past the halfway point, and the rapidly increasing inflation will soon make any offer unattractive to me.  
* **Anchoring:** My previous offers have been attempts at negotiation. By firmly stating that 50/50 is non-negotiable, I'm setting a new anchor point for the remaining rounds. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Alice needs to consider if squeezing a few extra dollars out of me is worth the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
