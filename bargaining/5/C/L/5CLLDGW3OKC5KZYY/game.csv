60.0,40.0,Let's start with a fair offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'll be losing money due to inflation as the game goes on.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. You still get a significant amount, and I get a bit more to compensate for the potential loss in future rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, your offer doesn't account for the increasing inflation. This split is more balanced considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"I understand your concerns about inflation, but I think you're overestimating its impact. This offer is a bit more generous to me, considering the money is still worth the same to me.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise - it acknowledges the inflation while still giving you a good share.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
40.0,60.0,"We're indeed running out of time, and I think this offer is a better compromise. The inflation is affecting your share more significantly now, so I'm willing to take a bit more.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We need to settle this now.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
38.0,62.0,"I understand your frustration, but a 50/50 split doesn't account for the fact that my share isn't affected by inflation. This offer is a bit more realistic.",Bob,8,

48.0,52.0,"Bob, we're down to the wire.  This is my final offer - it's a reasonable split considering the circumstances. Let's close this out.",Alice,9,
