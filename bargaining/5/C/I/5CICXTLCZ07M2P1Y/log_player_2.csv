# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and inflation is hurting me.  This offer is a compromise - meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, and her offers are getting worse for her.  While I'm willing to be somewhat generous, I think I can get a better deal in the next couple of rounds as the pressure mounts on her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""} 

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out and Alice is feeling the squeeze from inflation.  By offering an even split, I'm demonstrating fairness while also increasing the likelihood of her accepting.  It's a strong position to take in this late stage of the game."
