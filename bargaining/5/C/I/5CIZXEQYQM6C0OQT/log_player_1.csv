"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob.  This is a fair starting point, as it allows for potential negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While the offer is better than my initial proposal, I still believe I can achieve a more favorable outcome. I am willing to negotiate, but I will not accept an offer that gives me less than 90% of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 95% for me, and 5% for Bob. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still securing a significant portion of the money. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the inflation that has occurred."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation rate has drastically decreased the value of the money I would receive.  It is in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a portion of the money before further inflation diminishes its value."
