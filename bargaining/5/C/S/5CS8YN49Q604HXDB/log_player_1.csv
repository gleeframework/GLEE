"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, but I'll take a slightly bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain in Round 2 being worth the same as in Round 1, and Bob's money being worth 10% less, I need to be cautious.

Since Bob is offering a 50-50 split, but with a slightly larger share for himself, I'll have to think carefully. However, I'll also consider the fact that the money I gain is worth the same as in the previous round.

I'll reject this offer for now and wait for a better one.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, but with a slightly larger share for himself, I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation factor.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair one. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, which is a slightly more uneven split than the previous round. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain in Round 4 being worth the same as in Round 1, and Bob's money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to consider the decreasing value of Bob's offer.

However, Bob's offer is still a 40-60 split, which is a significant concession from his previous 50-50 offer. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the risk of waiting for a better one.

Considering the inflation factor, I think I'll take this offer.
