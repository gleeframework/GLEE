I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money.  I'll see what Bob thinks!  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer offer, and I'm not sure I can improve on it in the next round. Even with inflation, Bob is taking a bigger risk by rejecting this. I'll take the 50!"
