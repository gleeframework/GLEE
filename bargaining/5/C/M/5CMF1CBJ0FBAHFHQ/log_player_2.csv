Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, hoping I'll panic as inflation eats into my potential gains.  I need to push her a bit more, but I'm also running out of time."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you a very reasonable deal.  Take it before inflation makes this whole thing pointless for both of us.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob. Each round, your share is worth less. I'm willing to make a deal, but it's going to be on my terms. 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's painful, but I need to accept.  Alice is playing hardball, and with each round, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. Accepting a 41/59 split now is better than risking getting even less later, or even nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
