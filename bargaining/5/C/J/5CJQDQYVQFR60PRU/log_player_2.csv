"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple 60/40 split. It's a good deal for both of us considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Let's see if we can get a better deal!  I'll try to negotiate a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer. It's still a good deal for both of us, especially considering the potential for inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's meet in the middle. 52/48 is a reasonable compromise.  We're losing money with each round! 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers with the inflation. Let's take this deal."
