Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Come on, Alice, we're running out of time! This is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster inflation on my side.  While the deal is getting closer to something acceptable, waiting him out a bit longer could force him to be more reasonable.  It's a gamble, but I still have some rounds left before the money becomes worthless."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this drags on.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  The offer is heavily skewed in my favor, but the rapidly depreciating value means Bob needs to make a decision NOW. He might go for a smaller but guaranteed gain rather than risking it all for a slightly better outcome in later rounds.  The ""final offer"" angle adds pressure."
