"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and giving 100,000 to Bob.  I think this is a fair starting point, acknowledging that I have the advantage of making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, the proposed split is extremely unfair, giving me a much smaller share than what I initially proposed.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I propose a 70/30 split, giving me 700,000 and Bob 300,000. While I'm willing to compromise,  I believe this split is still more fair considering the inflation factor and the fact that I made the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the money is worth less now due to inflation, I still find this offer to be too unfavorable. I am willing to compromise, but the proposed 40/60 split is too lopsided, especially considering the significant inflation on my side. I believe we can reach a fairer agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 600,000 and Bob 400,000. This reflects a significant compromise from my previous offer, taking into account the inflation and Bob's initial offer. I believe this is a fair and balanced solution that allows both of us to walk away with a reasonable portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the significant inflation that has occurred. Although I would have preferred a larger share earlier in the game, accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount of money, and it avoids the risk of further inflation diminishing my potential earnings."
