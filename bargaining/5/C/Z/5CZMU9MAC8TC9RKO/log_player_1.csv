"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split, keeping almost all the money for myself.  The goal is to get Bob to accept this offer as quickly as possible to avoid the potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to get more, the inflation factor makes this a good deal for me. I'm guaranteed half a million, and it's unlikely Bob will get a better deal in the next round."
