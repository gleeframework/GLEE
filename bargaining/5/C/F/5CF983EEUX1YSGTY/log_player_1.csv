Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a split where we both receive amounts that account for the decreasing value of money over time. This ensures fairness in our distribution. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000
