"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can take 40.""}

Please let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a bit too 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is worth 20% less than the original $100, his gain of $30 is actually worth $24 in the original money.

I'm not thrilled about giving up 30% of the total, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept the offer.
