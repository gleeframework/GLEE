"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a good starting point that's fair, while also leaving room for negotiation if Bob isn't happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While I'm still getting a significant share of the money, the inflation is making it worth less.  I think I can get a better deal if we keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. Since I'm the one making the offer now, I think I can get a better deal than what Bob offered in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting much less than I initially wanted, the inflation is really starting to hurt. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting even less in the next round."
