"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty extreme imbalance! I'm not interested in accepting an offer that gives me only $100, when I could have had $5,000 in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to be more strategic this time. Given the inflation, I'll aim for a smaller share, but still try to get a decent amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2000,
  ""bob_gain"": 8000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating into my potential earnings! Given that my share is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer. However, it's still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going into another round.
