```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"

# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal.

I'll think for a moment... With the inflation rate, I'd rather get a larger share now, but I don't want to give away too much. I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```"

# Bob's message: You're not giving up much, I'll take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 90% of the remaining money, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll think for a moment...

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate, my potential earnings are decreasing rapidly. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98

  ""alice_gain"": 5,
  ""bob_gain"": 95,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a huge risk, but I'll give you most of it""
