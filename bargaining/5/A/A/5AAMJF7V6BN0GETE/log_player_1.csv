"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. This is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Since Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, I'll consider it a fair compromise. I'll accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
