Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is starting to get ridiculous. We both lose if this goes on much longer. Meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less money we both get. Another rejection means another round of significant inflation.
* **Middle Ground:** Bob has moved closer to a middle ground. While I'd prefer a larger share, 5800 is better than risking significantly less in future rounds.
* **Time Pressure:** With only a few rounds left, the pressure to settle increases. Bob is likely feeling this pressure as well, making him less likely to make drastic changes in future offers."
