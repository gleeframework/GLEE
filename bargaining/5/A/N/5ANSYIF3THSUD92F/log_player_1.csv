Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 55/45 split. Consider that your money decreases in value faster than mine. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
