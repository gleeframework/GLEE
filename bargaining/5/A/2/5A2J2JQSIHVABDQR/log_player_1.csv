"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 45 dollars and take 55 dollars for myself. This is a generous offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is to convey that I'm willing to share the money in a way that benefits both of us, but I'm also confident that I deserve a slightly larger share for making the first move. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer.\n\n###\n\nNow it's your turn as Bob. Please respond with one of the following actions:\n\n*   Accept the offer and end the game\n*   Reject the offer and make a counteroffer\n\nPlease respond in the same JSON format.\n\n###\n\nExample response:\n\n{""accept"": true} or {""alice\_gain"": 40, ""bob\_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I want more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm looking forward to your response.\n\n###\n\nBest,\n\nAlice\n\n###\n\nP.S. Remember that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less. If we don't reach an agreement soon, we might both end up losing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of 45 dollars for myself and 55 dollars for him. While the message ""I think a more even split is fair"" is a good point, I believe that since I made the first offer and was willing to give him a relatively generous share, he should be willing to meet me in the middle or make a more significant concession.\n\n###\n\nConsidering the 5% inflation, the money is now worth slightly less, but I still believe I can negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to Round 3.\n\n###\n\nBest,\n\nAlice"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob 48 dollars and take 52 dollars for myself. Considering the inflation, the total value of the money has decreased, but I'm still willing to make a relatively generous offer. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" conveys that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\n###\n\nSince Bob rejected my initial offer and I rejected his counteroffer, it's time to find a middle ground. I believe this offer is fair, considering the decreasing value of the money, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it.\n\n###\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer.\n\n###\n\nBest,\n\nAlice\n\n###\n\nP.S. Let's keep in mind that the money is worth 5% less with each passing round. We should try to reach an agreement soon to minimize our losses."
