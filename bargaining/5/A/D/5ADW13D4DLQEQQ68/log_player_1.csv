Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I'll start by offering a 90/10 split, hoping to secure a good portion of the money early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's true that my share of the money is worth less due to inflation, a 45/55 split is still too unfavorable for me. I believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially since Bob is facing inflation as well.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. Since I'm facing a larger inflation rate, I'll need to secure a larger share to compensate.  I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob than the previous one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer. Even though the inflation rate is higher for me, a 40/60 split is still not equitable.  I believe I can hold out for a better deal, especially since Bob is also facing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground. With the inflation hitting me hard, I need to get a decent amount, but I also don't want to risk losing everything.  55/45 feels like a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable, but I'm still not ready to give in. I believe there's a better deal out there, even with the inflation impacting me more significantly. I'm willing to take the risk of losing a bit more money to see if I can negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm going to try a slightly different approach this round. The inflation is getting serious, and I need to secure some money.  Offering a 45/55 split is a compromise - it's a bit closer to Bob's previous offer, but I'm hoping he recognizes the need to reach an agreement before we both lose too much due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not accepting this offer.  While inflation is hitting me hard, a 30/70 split is simply too far off from what I believe is fair.  Bob's inflation is less severe, and I think he can offer a more equitable division. I'm going to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking losing more money in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

This is getting dicey, but I need to get something.  I'm offering a 40/60 split.  This acknowledges the inflation impacting us both, and I'm hoping Bob realizes that we need to reach a compromise soon or we'll both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting increasingly ridiculous, but I'm still not going to accept it.  While inflation is hitting me hard, a 25/75 split is simply not fair.  Bob's inflation is much less, and he clearly wants to take advantage of the situation.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal, even if it means risking losing everything.  I'm not going to be taken advantage of, especially not this late in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

This is my last offer. Inflation is crippling me, but I need to get something. A 35/65 split is the best I can do under the current circumstances.  I'm hoping Bob recognizes the urgency of the situation and finally agrees to a deal.  If he doesn't, we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a terrible deal, but it's better than nothing.  Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of my desperation, but with only one round left, I have no choice but to accept. The inflation has decimated the value of the money, and I'm left with a meager share.  It's a harsh lesson about the dangers of inflation and the importance of reaching an agreement early on."
