"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust from here if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, let's start again 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure why Bob is proposing to meet in the middle, but I'm not convinced that 50/50 is the best split. Since I'm worth 20% less now due to inflation, I'd like to adjust the proposal to account for that. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, and I think he's trying to take advantage of my reduced bargaining power due to inflation. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me less than 50% of the remaining money. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bit more""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, and I'm proposing that I get 52% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 48%. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept it."

# Bob's message: You're pushing it, I'll give you most of it, but I need something 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting desperate, but I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 30% of the remaining money. I've already adjusted for inflation, and I think I deserve a better share. I'll make one more attempt to negotiate, hoping Bob will be more generous."

Round 7

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's now or never, I'll take most of it 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only 20% of the remaining money. With the inflation rate being so high, I'm essentially getting pennies on the dollar. I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially since I've already adjusted for inflation. I'll take my chances and hope that Bob will come back with a better offer in the next round."

Round 9

I'm trying to be more realistic about the situation, given the high inflation rate. I'm proposing that I get 25% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 75%. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
