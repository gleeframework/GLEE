"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate, let's just divide and be done with it.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $5,000 and keep $5,000 for myself. I'm trying to be fair and straightforward, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I'm not sure I like Bob's offer, considering the inflation. If I accept, I'll be getting $4,000, which is worth 10% less than the $5,000 I initially proposed. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my offer to account for the decreasing value of money. I'll propose a slightly larger share for myself to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I still think this is a fair split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about getting $4,500, but I'm not sure I want to reject it either. The inflation has already reduced my potential gain significantly, and I don't want to risk getting even less in future rounds.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be satisfied and we can finally conclude the game.
