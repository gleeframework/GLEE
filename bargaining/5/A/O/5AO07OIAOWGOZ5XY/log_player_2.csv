"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""That's not a great starting point, let's be more equitable. This offer is fairer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer was crucial.** It showed her we're serious about getting a fair deal and not just accepting any offer. 
* **A 55/45 split in Bob's favor is a strong counter.** It's significantly better than her offer and still leaves a decent sum for Alice. 
* **The message emphasizes fairness.** This appeals to Alice's sense of reason and implies that accepting this offer is the logical choice. 

This offer aims to secure a favorable outcome for Bob while still being enticing enough for Alice to accept, avoiding further devaluation of the money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is attempting to compromise, this offer is still tilted in her favor. Accepting it would mean Bob loses out on a significant amount of potential earnings due to inflation. It's worth pushing for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, let's be practical. This is a win-win.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure is increasing:** With each round, the value of the money decreases. Bob needs to push for a deal quickly.
* **Slight concession from Round 2:** Offering Alice $480,000 is a small compromise to make the deal more appealing. 
* **""Win-win"" framing:** This language positions the offer as beneficial for both parties, encouraging Alice to accept.

By slightly lowering his initial demand, Bob increases the pressure on Alice to accept before inflation erodes the value of the deal even further."
