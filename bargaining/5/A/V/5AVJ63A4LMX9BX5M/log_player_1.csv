"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with a friendly message to Bob. Since the money is worth 5% less to me with each passing round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. I'm hoping Bob will see the offer as reasonable and accept it, ending the game early. If not, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less to me in this round, I need to take that into account when considering Bob's offer. However, I also want to keep in mind that if I reject this offer, I'll have to make a new proposal in the next round, and the money will be worth even less to me then.\n\nConsidering these factors, I think it's better to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to find a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less to me now (5% less in each of the first two rounds), I'll aim for a slightly lower amount than my initial proposal, but still try to get a bit more than Bob offered me in the previous round.\n\nHere's my new offer:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle!""}\n\nI hope this offer is more appealing to Bob, and we can reach an agreement soon!###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a little more, but I think a 53/47 split is fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 47 
# Bob gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less to me now, I need to carefully consider Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a better deal, I also don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round.\n\nBob's offer of a 53/47 split is closer to my previous proposal, and considering the inflation, it might be a reasonable compromise. I'll have to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus trying to negotiate further.\n\nAfter some thought, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. I think it's better to secure a deal now rather than risking further losses due to inflation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nLet's finalize the agreement!###"
