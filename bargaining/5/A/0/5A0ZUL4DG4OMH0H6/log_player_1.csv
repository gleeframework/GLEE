"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll take 90% of the money, and give Bob the remaining 10%. It's a good starting point, and I want to see if he'll accept a deal that favors me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more money, the inflation makes this offer a lot more appealing than the previous round.  Getting 500,000 is better than 720,000 (900,000 * 0.8) after inflation."
