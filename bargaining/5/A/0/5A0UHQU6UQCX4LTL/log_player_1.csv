"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40% of the total amount, which is $400,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering that I'm the one making the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but you have to make a better offer next time! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll have to consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer this time!

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50-50, a fair and equal proposal!""}

I'm proposing that we split the money evenly, with each of us getting $500,000. I think this is a fair and equal proposal, and it's a good compromise after Bob's previous offer."
