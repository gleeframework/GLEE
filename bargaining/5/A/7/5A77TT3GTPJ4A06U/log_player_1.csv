"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a small amount, but keeping the majority of the money for myself, while also giving him an incentive to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's start with a fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Meeting in the middle seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal to get a better deal. With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You can have 40, but I need more to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight advantage, but I still want a decent share 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be careful. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer to get some certainty.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
