"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal split, as fairness seems to be important. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $500,000 in Round 2 is equivalent to $400,000 in real value.

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
