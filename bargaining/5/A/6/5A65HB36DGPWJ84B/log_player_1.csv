"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a small share to get the ball rolling. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Seems fair to me. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, my gain of $9,000 is now worth $8,550.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me. Splitting it evenly would mean I'd get $5,000, which is worth $4,762.50 after inflation. I'm not sure if I want to settle for that.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain of $8,550 is now worth $8,102.50.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is a smaller share than before, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to budge a bit more, but I still think we should aim for a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $8,102.50 is now worth $6,960.88.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not sure if it's the best deal for me. Splitting it 60/40 in my favor would mean I'd get $6,000, which is worth $5,213.31 after inflation. I'm not sure if I want to settle for that.

However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of time and the decreasing value of money. I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that I can do better in the next round.
