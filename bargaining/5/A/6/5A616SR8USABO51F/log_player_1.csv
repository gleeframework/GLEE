I'm going to start with a very unfair proposal.  I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If he accepts, I win big.  If he rejects, I'll have to be more reasonable in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's just as unfair as mine was, and I'm not willing to settle for just $1.  I'll make a more balanced proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest offer possible, and I think it's in both our best interests to agree.  If we keep rejecting each other's offers, we risk getting nothing at all."
