"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the lead""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me getting the larger share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40, a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, the effective split is more like 75/25 in favor of Bob. I'll have to decide...

I'll reject this offer for now. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're pushing for more, I'm willing to give a bit more, but not too much""
}
```

I'm adjusting the split to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. A 50/50 split seems like a fair compromise, considering the reduced value of the money.

I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
