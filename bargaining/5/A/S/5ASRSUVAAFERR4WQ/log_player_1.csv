Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split, a fair and simple solution that doesn't take into account the inflation uncertainty, but ensures we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
