"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is my first offer. I'm keeping the majority of the money but giving Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, I'm not sure if I can get a better deal. The risk of inflation is too great, and a 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
