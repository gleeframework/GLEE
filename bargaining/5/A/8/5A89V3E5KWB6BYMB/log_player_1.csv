"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $90 and Bob gets $10."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, Alice. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less in Round 2, my gain would be $81, not $90.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
