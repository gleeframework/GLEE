"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going for a generous but not foolish first offer. This gives Bob a decent amount while still securing the majority for me.  I'm hoping this will entice Bob to accept in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  I believe I can still get a good share, especially since the money is losing value with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

Since Bob rejected my initial offer, I'm going to reduce my share a bit, but still keep it above 80%.  It's important to show flexibility, but I'm not going to give away too much.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob in light of the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough.  I'm going to reject it again.  The money is losing value quickly, so I need to hold out for a better deal.  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not going to accept a deal that gives me significantly less than I deserve."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm trying to maintain a balance between being fair and ensuring I get a decent share.  I'm hoping that the rapidly diminishing value of the money will encourage Bob to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, but I'm still not willing to settle for a deal that leaves me with less than half of the money.  I'm going to reject his offer and hope that we can reach a compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer again, but I'm still trying to maintain a significant share.  Time is running out and the inflation is hitting hard, but I'm not willing to settle for a drastically unfair deal.  I hope this offer will finally be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting hard, and I'm starting to run out of time.  While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's a better deal than what I would get if we fail to reach an agreement.  I'm going to accept this offer and secure a decent amount of money before the value decreases even further."
