"Round 1

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob!""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 10% less for Bob, I'd like to negotiate a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I think I can do better than 2000.
