"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward proposal. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still keeping the majority! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

After considering the offer, I decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my initial proposal, but still reflects a fair and reasonable split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to squeeze out a better deal for himself.

I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, especially considering the money is worth even less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to come up with a new proposal that's more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 30% to feel comfortable. Let's meet in the middle-ish!""

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get closer to his target, but I'm not willing to give up that much.

I'm not happy with the 25/75 split, especially considering the money is worth even less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.
