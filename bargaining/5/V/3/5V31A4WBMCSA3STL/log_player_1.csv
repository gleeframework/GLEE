I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair and simple. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, it's better to accept this offer.  Inflation means the money I gain is worth less, and the next round will only make that worse. I'll take the 45 dollars."
