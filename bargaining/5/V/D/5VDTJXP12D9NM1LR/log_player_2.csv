"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly and save our money from inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept a ""fair"" split, but I'm Bob and I know that with each round, the money will be worth less. I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try 60/40 in my favor, and we can both avoid losing too much to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split. Let's come to an agreement! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take its toll, and I don't want to risk losing everything. This offer is a decent compromise, and I'd rather get something than nothing."
