"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but it's still fair 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I don't think I'll accept this offer. I was hoping for a slightly larger share, and 2000 seems too low for me. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Now it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the 50-50 split, but still gives me a slightly larger share. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, but I need a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer. 3000 is still a bit low for me, and I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up more. However, I don't want to reject it and risk Bob making an even lower offer in the next round.

I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like I'll be walking away with $3000!"
