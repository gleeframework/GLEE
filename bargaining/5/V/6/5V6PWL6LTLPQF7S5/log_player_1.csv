"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering your offer in the previous round.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the loss in value.

I'll reject this offer for now and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think 55-45 is a bit too generous for Bob. I'll make a counter-offer: 5000 for me and 5000 for you.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll aim to get a bit more to make up for it. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A 55-45 split is closer to what I had in mind. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
