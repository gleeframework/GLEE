Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair deal considering we both have an equal chance of winning in the next round, and the inflation will only decrease the value of the money further.  Let's end this on a good note. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
