"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose an even split. It's the most sensible way to ensure we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my $500,000 gain is now worth 80% of the original amount, so it's equivalent to $400,000. Bob's $500,000 gain remains the same as in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an even split, especially since the money is worth less for me due to inflation. I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is worth 64% of the original amount (80% of 80%), so I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more to ensure I don't lose out. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still offering a fair deal. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my $400,000 gain is now worth 40% of the original amount (since 1 - 0.488 = 0.512, and 0.512 * 1,000,000 = 512,000, then 512,000 / 1,280,000 = 0.4). This is actually a good deal for me, considering the decreasing value of money.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
