"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more.""
}
```

This is my opening offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you halfway, let's settle this 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think meeting halfway is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept this offer. Let's settle this and call it a day!"
