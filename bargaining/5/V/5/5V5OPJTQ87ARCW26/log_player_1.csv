"Round 1

  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 20% of the total.""

# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more fair, Alice. I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I think it's a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's now worth $7,200.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not convinced that it's a good deal for me. I'd rather wait for a better offer.
