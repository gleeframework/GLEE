Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a greedy approach, assuming Bob will want something rather than nothing, and leaving him with just $1. I'm banking on the fact that this is a one-time game and not a repeated negotiation, so the threat of retaliation in future rounds doesn't apply. Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, it's clear that Bob is willing to take a larger share.  With inflation, it's likely that accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I receive a significant amount of the money.  It's better to take 400,000 now than risk getting nothing at all in future rounds."
