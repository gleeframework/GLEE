Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being kind 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting worse, accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gains. Alice knows the pressure is on me due to inflation. I need to hold out for a slightly better deal, hoping she becomes more willing to compromise as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. While I'd prefer a better split, a 50/50 offer is fair and gives me a much better chance of securing some winnings. Alice is likely aware of the time pressure as well, making her more receptive to a straightforward and equitable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your money is melting, mine isn't 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming critical. Accepting this offer, while not ideal, guarantees me something rather than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation to her advantage, and further resistance might lead to even worse offers."
