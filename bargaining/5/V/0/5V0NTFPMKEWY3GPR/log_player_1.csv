"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, no need to negotiate too hard.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, given the inflation we'll both be facing if we go another round.  Let's work together to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,500 in this round is equivalent to $3,600 in the first round. Bob's gain of $5,500 in this round is equivalent to $4,200 in the first round.

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a fairer split than my original offer, and it's still a decent amount considering the inflation.
