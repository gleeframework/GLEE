"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll take a smaller share for now. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is now worth less due to inflation, I'll consider it carefully. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think I can do better. The game will proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer is a bit more balanced, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not budging, I'll take a smaller share for now. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is quite aggressive! Considering the effects of inflation, I'll think carefully about this one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 85% of the original $100, even with inflation. The game will proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite extreme, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more reasonable. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. This is a fair split.""
}
```

This offer is a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise."
