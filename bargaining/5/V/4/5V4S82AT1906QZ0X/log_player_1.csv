Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a split of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob.  I think this is a fair offer, considering I'm the one making the proposal.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
It's better to take half the money than to risk getting nothing at all.  Even though I'm getting less than I proposed, this is a good deal."
