"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I propose keeping the majority of the money for myself, as the first mover, and offering a small amount to Bob.  While it's a small amount, it may be enough to incentivize him to accept rather than risk getting nothing if we go through multiple rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. Although I'm losing money due to inflation, 5% is a small amount, and I can still afford to reject this offer. I believe that I can get a better deal if I wait for my turn in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 90 for myself and 10 for Bob. This still gives me the majority, but it shows some compromise and may convince him to accept before inflation erodes my share further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the inflation is starting to become more significant, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. Bob's offer is a bit too lopsided, and I'm willing to risk another round to get a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15} 
```

I am increasing my offer again. Inflation is taking a toll, but I am still confident that I can get a better deal than Bob's offer in the next round. This offer shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  The inflation is getting serious, but I'm holding out for a better deal. While Bob is offering more than before, it's still not enough to compensate for the inflation.  I believe there's still a chance I can get a larger share if I wait for my turn."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to 80 for myself and 20 for Bob.  While the inflation is hurting, I believe this offer is fair and shows good faith. I'm hoping it will convince Bob to accept and avoid further rounds of losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I am accepting Bob's offer. While inflation has taken a significant bite out of my potential earnings, I am no longer in a position to risk getting nothing.  The offer is more than I would have received in the previous round, and I am willing to cut my losses and end the game."
