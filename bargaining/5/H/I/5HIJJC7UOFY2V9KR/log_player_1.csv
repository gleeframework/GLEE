"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets the remaining $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $3,600. Bob's gain of $6,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4,800.

I'm not sure if I like this offer, but I'll accept it.
