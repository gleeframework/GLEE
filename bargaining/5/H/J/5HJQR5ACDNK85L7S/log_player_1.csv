"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too greedy, Alice. I'll give you a smaller share this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to come back with a new offer so quickly!

I'm not sure I like this offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, I'll take the offer, but I'll make sure to make a better one in the next round.
