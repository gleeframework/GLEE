"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me a majority of the money, but it's still fair since I'm taking the risk of Bob rejecting it and forcing us into a new round with less money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the value of the money is decreasing with each round. Accepting this offer guarantees me half the remaining money, which is better than risking getting less in the next round."
