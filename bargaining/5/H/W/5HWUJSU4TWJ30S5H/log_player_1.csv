"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money in a 3:1 ratio. This might seem a bit lopsided, but consider the decreasing value of money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 1:1 split, since we're both starting with the same amount of money and the value of money is decreasing at different rates for us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
