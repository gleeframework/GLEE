"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to give up 50% of the remaining value of the money, considering the inflation. I want to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, while still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's getting harder to negotiate a better deal due to the increasing inflation. 520,000 is a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values."
