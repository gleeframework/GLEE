"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to keep the majority of the money, but I think this is a fair starting point. Let's see what you think!

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a more equitable starting point, considering the value of money will decrease for both of us over time. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still hoping for a larger share. I think a 60/40 split is more reasonable, given the inflation we are facing.  Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable solution. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. Inflation has already devalued my potential gains, and if I reject this offer, the next round will see my share further reduced. It's better to secure a 40% share now than risk getting a smaller percentage later."
