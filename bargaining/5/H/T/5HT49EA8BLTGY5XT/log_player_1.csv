"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This seems like a fair and simple way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 40% of the total amount. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced you're getting a fair deal, but I'm willing to give a bit more 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer again! The money I gain is worth less and less with each round, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 35% of the total amount. I think I can do better than that. I'll propose another offer and see if I can get a better deal.

I'll try to be more aggressive in my next offer, considering the decreasing value of the money I gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I think this is my last chance to get a fair deal""}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer. I'm trying to squeeze out as much as I can, considering the decreasing value of the money I gain. This might be my last chance to get a decent deal, so I'm going all in."
