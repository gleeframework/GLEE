"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both of us 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This seems like a bad deal for me in the long run.  While it seems fair now, if I reject, I'm guaranteed to make more money in the next round due to the inflation working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but this is my starting point. The clock is ticking!""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer heavily favored her. By immediately counter-proposing, I signal I'm serious about getting a better deal.  The message aims to:

* **Establish Dominance:** I'm taking charge of the negotiation.
* **Introduce Urgency:**  The inflation factor makes each round count.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** I'm starting high, but implying I might move down later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, think carefully 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, but I need to hold my nerve. While the decreasing value hurts, accepting this offer would be a significant loss compared to even her initial offer.  There's still a chance she'll panic as the rounds progress and offer a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. Don't let greed make you lose out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've significantly lowered my demand from the previous round, signaling a willingness to compromise. 
* **Shifting Blame:** My message subtly puts pressure on Alice, implying that *she* will be at fault if a deal isn't reached.
* **Time Pressure:**  Each round gets worse for me, but it's important to convey that this is Alice's last chance to secure a favorable deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While 3000 is significantly less than I aimed for, rejecting this offer is extremely risky. In the next round, the inflation will eat into the value even further, making it almost impossible to recover. Alice knows this, hence her ""generous"" offer.  

It's painful, but accepting now cuts my losses and guarantees a reasonable payout rather than risking a disastrous outcome in further rounds."
