"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finalize the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a good chunk for myself! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money I'll gain due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more generous, but still holding out for a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to get a good deal, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. This is my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money I'll gain. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I'll have to accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's getting late in the game and I don't want to risk going home with nothing.
