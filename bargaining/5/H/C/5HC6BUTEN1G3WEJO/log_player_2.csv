Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a slightly better deal, the inflation is rapidly eroding the value of Bob's potential earnings. It's time to push for a more significant change in her favor or risk getting a much worse deal as time runs out."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the deal is getting worse with every round.  I'm offering a reasonable 52-48 split. Let's be sensible and end this.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going lower than this 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting comfortable and thinks she's in control. However, time is running out *for her* as well. We need to show strength and demonstrate that Bob's patience is wearing thin. There's a chance she'll cave in the next round and offer something more reasonable before the inflation demolishes Bob's potential gain."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this 53-47 split, or we both walk away with nothing. Don't let greed ruin this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance before we both lose, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds left, the inflation has eaten away most of Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of 45 is better than risking getting nothing at all if the game reaches the 12th round."
