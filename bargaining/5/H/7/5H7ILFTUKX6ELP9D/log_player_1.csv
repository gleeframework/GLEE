Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10. This is a pretty generous offer considering the inflation risk!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I would have preferred more, accepting this offer is the best option. With each round, the money I gain is worth less due to inflation. It's better to take the $10 now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
