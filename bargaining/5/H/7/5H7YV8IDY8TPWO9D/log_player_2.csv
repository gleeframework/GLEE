**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her due to inflation. It's still heavily in her favor, and time is on my side. I'll hold out for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair 50/50 split. Let's end this now before inflation eats away any more of your share.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more keenly. It's time to push for a more equitable split. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair, and it's a strong negotiating position. It becomes increasingly difficult for Alice to justify taking less as time goes on. 
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the shrinking pie for Alice, urging her to act before the deal gets even worse for her."
