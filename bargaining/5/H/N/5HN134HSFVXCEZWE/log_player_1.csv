"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'm offering Bob 400,000, but I'm keeping 600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, I'm actually getting a better deal than I initially offered. But Bob's gain is worth 20% less than it would have been in the first round, so he's getting a worse deal.

Considering this, I think I can do better than a 60-40 split, but I'm not sure if I want to give Bob an even larger share. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 70-30, I'll try to counter with an even more generous offer to see if Bob will accept.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share. Will you accept this compromise?""
}
```

This offer is a 42-58 split, which is more favorable to Bob than his previous offer. I'm hoping he'll see it as a reasonable compromise and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but still trying to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money Bob gains being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, he's getting an even worse deal than in the previous round. Considering that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I think I can do better than a 45-55 split.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 55-45, I'll try to counter with an even more generous offer to see if Bob will accept.

  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Will you accept this compromise?""
}
```

This offer is a 48-52 split, which is more favorable to Bob than his previous offer. I'm hoping he'll see it as a reasonable compromise and accept."
