"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take $6,000, which is 60% of the original amount. This way, we can end the game quickly and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, no need to rush! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll consider the adjusted amounts. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced it's fair yet. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm not accepting the equal split, as I'd like to try to get a better deal."
