Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Even though the nominal value is the same, I'm losing a significant chunk of my potential gains due to inflation with every passing round.  I need to push for a better split before the difference becomes too large."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it before we both lose out! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Bob is extremely unlikely to offer anything better than a 50/50 split at this point. Continuing to hold out risks getting nothing at all.  While not ideal due to the inflation, accepting now guarantees I at least receive something."
