"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going for 4:1 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the new offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm looking for a better deal. I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Let's try to negotiate again!

I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 3:2, let's settle this""}

I'm proposing a 3:2 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much ground 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

I'll propose:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more equal distribution of the funds. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept the offer."
