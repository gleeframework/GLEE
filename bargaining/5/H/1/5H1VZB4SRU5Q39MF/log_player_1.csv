I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself.  I think this is a fair offer, as I'm taking the majority of the money but still giving Bob a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering Bob $450,000, and taking $550,000 for myself.  This is a compromise from our previous offers.  Hopefully, Bob will see the value in this offer and agree."
