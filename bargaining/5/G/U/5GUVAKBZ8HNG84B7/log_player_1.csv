"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even split considering we're starting with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we're both working towards getting something. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the inflation effect.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that we can revisit the split in future rounds.
