"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll start by offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a large enough offer to be tempting for him, but still leaves me with the lion's share.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled with the 10% decrease in value, it's still better than nothing. If I reject this offer, the value of the money will continue to decline. I'll accept the offer and move on."
