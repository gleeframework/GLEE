"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\n\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact on you""}\n\nI'm offering Bob a significant amount, taking into account that with each round, his share's value decreases more than mine, making it a relatively fair start considering the conditions. This also leaves room for negotiation without risking too much loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer acknowledges the inflation while still being advantageous for you. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject this offer because, although Bob's share value decreases, the proposed division doesn't sufficiently account for the future rounds' potential loss for him, which could allow for a more favorable division for me. Additionally, accepting now doesn't maximize the potential gain considering Bob's increasing loss of value per round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation on your share, this is a more balanced offer""}\n\nGiven the progressive devaluation of Bob's potential gain, I'm adjusting my offer slightly to still be attractive but also recognizing the pressure on Bob to settle due to the increasing loss of value in each subsequent round. This strategy aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Bob before the value of his potential share decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, this is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject this offer because, despite the significant decrease in value for Bob, his offer doesn't adequately reflect the urgency and the disproportionate loss he faces with each passing round. By holding out, I'm betting on Bob's increasing motivation to settle for a less favorable division as the rounds progress and his potential gain's value diminishes further, hoping to secure a larger share for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 620000, ""bob_gain"": 380000, ""message"": ""Given the substantial decrease in your share's value, this offer is more realistic considering the time pressure""}\n\nI'm increasing my share in the proposal, leveraging the fact that Bob's potential gain is significantly decreasing with each round. This offer still gives Bob a substantial amount but reflects the urgency and the impact of inflation on his share, aiming to bring the negotiation closer to a conclusion in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer - a straight 50/50 split.  Let's end this now before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject this offer because, despite Bob's claim of it being his final offer and the significant impact of inflation on his share, accepting a 50/50 split at this point would mean ignoring the strategic advantage gained from the rounds that have passed. Given that Bob's share is worth 67.23% less than initially, and mine retains its full value, I believe there's still room to negotiate for a larger share, exploiting the time pressure and the disproportionate effect of inflation on Bob's potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Considering the drastic decrease in your share's value and the time running out, this is a more realistic offer""}\n\nGiven the extreme devaluation of Bob's potential gain and the pressure to conclude the negotiation before the value decreases further or we reach the 12-round limit, I'm proposing a division that significantly favors me. This offer still allows Bob to walk away with something, but it reflects the strategic advantage I've gained through the negotiation process and the impact of inflation on Bob's share."
