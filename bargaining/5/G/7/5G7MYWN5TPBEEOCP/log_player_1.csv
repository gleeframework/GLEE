"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 80/20, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's see if we can do better than Alice's initial offer! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

In this round, my gain of $5000 is equivalent to 62.5% of the initial $10,000, and Bob's gain of $5000 is equivalent to 50% of the initial $10,000.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it.
