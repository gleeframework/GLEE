"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. It's a good offer for you considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes next, I might be able to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. I'm willing to split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share.  It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where we're even close to splitting the original amount. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is right, the inflation is getting out of hand and I don't want to risk ending up with even less. 50/50 is a fair split considering the circumstances."
