"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 10% of the money, is that fair?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 10% of the money, which is $100,000, and I'll take the remaining 90%, which is $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair 60% 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, I'd like to reconsider Bob's offer. Since I'll be gaining $600,000, which is worth 5% less than the $900,000 I was offered in the first round, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30% of the money, it's a fair compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, 55% 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice gain: $450,000 (worth 14.26% less than the $900,000 I was offered in the first round)
Bob gain: $550,000 (worth 48.8% less than the $200,000 I was offered in the first round)

Considering the significant decrease in value, I think this offer is more reasonable than my previous ones. I'll accept it.
