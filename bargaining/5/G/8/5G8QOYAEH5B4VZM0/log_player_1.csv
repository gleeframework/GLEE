"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being cautious, let's see if you'll accept a smaller share for yourself 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so the effective amounts are:

* Alice gain: $2000
* Bob gain: $8000

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less again, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1500,
  ""bob_gain"": 8500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get something for my efforts""
}
```

I'm proposing a 15-85 split in my favor, with me getting $1,500 and Bob getting $8,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're giving me less than I asked for in round 2, I'll take this deal 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value.

With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain is worth a lot less. I'll calculate the effective amounts:

* Alice gain: $1,000
* Bob gain: $9,000

Considering the previous offers, I think this is a decent deal for me. I'll accept Bob's offer.
