"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000

Let's see if we can do better!  I'm sure we can find a split that's more beneficial for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. This split is more equitable and still leaves a good chunk for you. Let's see if we can agree on this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bit more, the inflation is starting to bite, and this offer is closer to what I was aiming for.  Let's end this now."
