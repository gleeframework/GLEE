"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not giving away too much. Accept or reject?""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. It's a win-win for both of us, and we can move on to other things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 10% less than the original 100$, which is 70 * 0.9 = 63$. Bob's gain is worth 20% less than the original 30$, which is 30 * 0.8 = 24$.

I don't think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money, considering the inflation. I'd rather try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than the previous round, so my gain is worth 63 * 0.9 = 56.7$. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this time. Accept or reject?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, but it's still a fair deal considering the inflation. Let's end this game and get the money! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 27.1% less than the original 100$, which is 70 * 0.723 = 50.61$. Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than the original 30$, which is 30 * 0.516 = 15.48$.

I'm not sure if this is the best deal I can get, but I'm getting a bit desperate since we're running out of rounds. I'll accept this offer to get some money.
