"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Bob a small portion, aiming to encourage him to accept in the first round. I want to secure the majority of the money while minimizing the risk of him rejecting and pushing the game into further rounds where inflation hurts me more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still significantly unfavorable to me.  While I'm losing money due to inflation, it's only 10% less than the previous round, whereas Bob's offer gives him 80% of the money, which is a much greater loss in value due to the 20% inflation he's experiencing. I'm willing to risk another round to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 600,000, while still maintaining a significant majority.  This should be more appealing to Bob, as he's likely feeling the pressure of increasing inflation.  While I still risk rejection, I believe this is a reasonable offer considering the diminishing value of the money with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly unfavorable, even with the increased inflation he's experiencing.  I'm losing almost 30% of the value of my potential gain from the first round, while he's gaining 60% of the money, despite the 48.8% inflation on his side. I'm willing to risk another round to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to bridge the gap and make it more appealing to Bob.  This is a significant compromise for me, as the inflation is now hitting hard. But, I believe it's the best strategy to secure a deal before the potential for further losses becomes even greater."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is hitting both of us hard, but I'm losing over 40% of the value of my potential gain from the first round.  This offer, while still not ideal, is the best I'm likely to get.  I'm accepting to avoid further losses and secure some of the remaining value."
