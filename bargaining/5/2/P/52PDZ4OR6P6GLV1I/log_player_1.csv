"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and inviting Bob to make the next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you take 40, let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. If I take 40, the money I gain will be worth 10% less than the 50 I could have gotten in the first round, so I'm not getting the best deal. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value.

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm looking for a better split. Meet me halfway at 55/45?""
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70, you take 30, it's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering the money I gain is now worth significantly less than in the first round, I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the value of the money I gain is decreasing rapidly, and I'm not getting a fair share. I'll wait for a better offer that takes into account the devaluation of the money."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less now, I'll aim for an even higher share to make up for the loss in value.

  ""bob_gain"": 40,

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting! I'm not happy with this offer, but I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept it or risk waiting for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the value of the money I gain is now so low that 20 is essentially worthless to me. I'll wait for a better offer, but I'm running out of time and options."

```
{

}

I'm rejecting this offer because 10 is essentially worthless to me at this point. I'm not going to accept such a paltry sum when I could have gotten a much better deal earlier. I'll try to make one last push for a better offer."
