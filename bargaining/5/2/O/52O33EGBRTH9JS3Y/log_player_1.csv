"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  I think that's fair, and it avoids any further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather try to get a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to get a bigger share.""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and passing the decision to Bob to come up with a new proposal."
