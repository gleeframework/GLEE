"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money, and Bob 10%. While I want to maximize my own gains, it's important to remember that this is a negotiation. I want to make an offer that is fair enough to entice Bob to accept, so that we can both walk away with a decent sum of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my previous offer. Even with the inflation penalty, 300,000 is less than 900,000 with the 5% decrease. I will reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm taking a more moderate approach this time.  I'm offering Bob a larger share, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  While this reduces my own gain, I believe it's a better strategy to avoid another round of potentially even worse offers due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, as inflation has significantly lowered the value of the money. While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer still gives me a considerable sum, and rejecting it risks another round of further devaluation.  I'll accept the offer and end the game."
