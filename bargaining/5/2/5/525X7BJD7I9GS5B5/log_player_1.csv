"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game!""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still trying to conserve some for myself. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'm effectively getting $45 (60 * 0.75).

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45% share. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, my gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% * 0.9), so I'm effectively getting $40.5 (45 * 0.9).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, and we can see if Bob is willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'm still trying to hold on to some value. Will you take this? 
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round (100% - 27.1%), so I'm effectively getting $36.3 (50 * 0.729).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'd be getting a slightly higher share, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. However, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get."
