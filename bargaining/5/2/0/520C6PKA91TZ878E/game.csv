70.0,30.0,Let's split it in a 70/30 ratio. I believe this is fair considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I think a 60/40 split is a more equitable way to share the money.  While your proposal recognized the value decrease, I believe a closer split is more fair in the long run.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,I propose a 50/50 split. This maintains fairness while also acknowledging the diminishing value of money in each subsequent round.,Alice,3,
