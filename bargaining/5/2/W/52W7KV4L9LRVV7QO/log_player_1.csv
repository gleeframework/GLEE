"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large portion of the money (90%!), while still giving Bob a small amount. Since this is the first round, I am taking a risk that Bob will accept this.  However, if he rejects, the money will be worth significantly less for him in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than the offer I made in the first round. Even though the money is worth less for both of us, I am still better off rejecting this offer and making a counter-proposal in the next round.  I am confident that I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still keeping a larger proportion. This offer is likely to be more attractive to Bob than his previous offer, especially given the inflation. I'm hoping he'll accept, but if he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer again in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering me a larger share compared to his previous offer, it is still significantly less than what I would be willing to accept.  The inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me, so he's getting desperate. I'm going to hold out for a better deal,  confident that I can secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm further reducing my share by 100,000, but I believe this offer will still be attractive to Bob due to the inflation impacting him more significantly. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept. If he rejects, I will have to consider adjusting my offer again, but I'm confident I can still get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering me a larger share compared to his previous offer, it's still significantly less than what I'd prefer. The inflation is hitting Bob hard, making him desperate. I'm going to hold out for a better deal, confident that I can secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to entice him to accept. Inflation is hitting him hard, and this offer will give him more than what he's received so far.  I'm still holding out for a larger proportion, but with only a few rounds left, I need to be strategic and find a compromise that will allow us both to gain something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, inflation is hitting Bob extremely hard. This offer is close to a 50/50 split, and with only a few rounds left, the value of the money will continue to decline for both of us. Accepting this offer is the most sensible decision, as it guarantees a substantial gain for both of us."
