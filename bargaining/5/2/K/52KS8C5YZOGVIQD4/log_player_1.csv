Round 4

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to go a little higher, but I need a larger share than your last offer.  We're both losing money with each round, so we need to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I'll accept this offer. Let's finish this.""

Even though it's not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 6 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the money loses value for Alice.  Waiting longer means a worse deal for her even if Bob offers slightly more.
* **Downward Trend:** Bob's offers have been slowly increasing while Alice's have been decreasing. This trend suggests Bob might not go much higher.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** If Alice keeps rejecting offers, they risk reaching round 12 and getting nothing.

While 5800 is less than Alice's previous offers, it's still better than the risk of walking away with nothing.  This decision prioritizes securing a reasonable amount of money over holding out for a potentially unachievable ideal."
