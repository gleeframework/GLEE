Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take 99 dollars and give Bob 1 dollar.  It's a pretty unfair offer, but I'm hoping he'll be desperate enough to accept it in the first round.  I'll see how he reacts.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer offer than my initial proposal, and it's likely that Bob will be even more demanding in the future.  It's better to take what I can get now and avoid the risk of getting nothing later."
