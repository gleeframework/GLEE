"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer aims to maximize my gain in the first round. While it might be seen as unfair, it sets a precedent for me as the proposer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most strategic move.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  My share is worth 20% less, so a smaller gain is better than a larger gain that's significantly devalued. 
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject, I have to propose in the next round.  Inflation will continue, and Bob may become even more aggressive with his offers.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  A guaranteed 75 (even with inflation) is a decent outcome. Trying to get more might lead to a smaller share or nothing at all."
