"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70, you can have 30. It's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, which I think is a generous offer considering I'm the one making the first move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have it all, I need some too! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and 5% less than in the second round, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 40, you can have 60. It's a fair split!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, which I think is a reasonable offer considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a little 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'll think carefully before making a decision. However, I'm not willing to accept a 15/85 split, especially since I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 25, you can have 75. It's the best I can do!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 25/75 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm taking most 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is plummeting!

I'm not thrilled about the 10/90 split, but I'm getting desperate too. Considering the extremely low value of the money now, I'll reluctantly accept Bob's offer.
