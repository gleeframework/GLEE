Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to be more reasonable, but I still need to get the majority. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the impact of inflation on her potential gains. I need to push for a more equitable split before we start running out of rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a middle ground soon. Time is literally money in this game, and your share is decreasing with every round. This offer is fair and gives us both a good deal."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.  We've both been stubborn, let's make a deal before we both lose more money. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is undeniably fair. Plus, the longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for Alice. Accepting now secures a significant sum and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement."
