"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While 60/40 seems like a bad deal on the surface, the inflation plays a huge factor. It's important to push the game further to force a better offer from Alice as her share will devalue quicker than mine."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, so I'm proposing a 55/45 split. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses from inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:**  Alice's opening offer suggests she wants a significantly larger share. I'm countering with a more reasonable split that still favors me slightly.
* **Inflation Pressure:** While not ideal, accepting a slightly smaller gain than desired is better than dragging the game out.  Each round diminishes the overall value, and I want to capitalize on the fact that Alice's share loses value faster. 
* **Appearance of Compromise:** My message aims to make Alice feel heard while emphasizing the mutually beneficial aspect of settling quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my new offer is slightly lower, but still more than fair. 58-42 is the best I can do. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation, which is good. Her offer only slightly decreased despite the increasing devaluation. This tells me she likely won't let it drop much lower. By rejecting again, I'm aiming to make her sweat a bit more in the next round, hopefully leading to a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing every round. I'm proposing 60/40 - a strong offer considering the circumstances.  Take it now before it shrinks further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting Power Dynamic:**  After two rejections, I'm taking a more assertive stance.  My offer is now the inverse of her original, aiming to show her I'm serious about a more equitable split.
* **Time Pressure:** By round 4, the inflation has significantly impacted the value. I'm emphasizing the urgency of the situation, hoping to make Alice more amenable to accepting a deal rather than risking further losses.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a chance Alice might reject this offer, but it's a risk worth taking. If she's truly unwilling to budge from a highly favorable split, dragging the game out will only hurt us both. This offer is a clear signal that I'm not going to simply cave to her demands."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we both want the best deal, but I won't go below 56-44. Inflation is affecting us both, let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is the best I'm likely to get. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money. Waiting longer will only result in smaller gains for both of us.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Alice has barely budged from her initial position, indicating she's willing to risk significant losses to maintain a favorable split. Accepting now avoids a worse outcome later.
* **Potential for Loss:** If I reject this offer and we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds, we both get nothing. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk losing everything."
