"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the money 70-30 in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the value of the money will decrease for both of us with each round.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think a 60-40 split is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
