"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, $5000 is equivalent to $5,000 / 0.9 = $5555.55 in the first round. Similarly, Bob's $5000 is equivalent to $5000 / 0.95 = $5263.16 in the first round.

Considering the offers, I think Bob's proposal is reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
