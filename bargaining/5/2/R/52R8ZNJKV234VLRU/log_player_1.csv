Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm going to hold my ground and continue to offer a reasonable split. I'll keep lowering the offer a bit each round, but I'll make sure to keep a significant amount for myself."

I'm going to continue to lower my offer, but I'm still going to keep a significant amount for myself.  I think Bob is starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and he might be more willing to accept a deal closer to what I want."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

We're getting close to the end of the game, and the pressure is on.  Bob is feeling the heat of inflation, and I'm going to take advantage of that.  I'm still going to offer a decent amount to him, but I'm also going to make sure I get a majority of the money.  Let's see if this works."
