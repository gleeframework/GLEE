Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think a 55/45 split is more in line with the rate of inflation we're facing. Think about it - you lose less value over time! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
