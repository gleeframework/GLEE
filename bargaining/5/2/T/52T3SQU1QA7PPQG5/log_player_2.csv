Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, think about it 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is working in Bob's favor.  Alice's share is losing value much faster than Bob's. Bob can likely push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's end this now with a perfectly fair split.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Offering a 50/50 split at this stage is strategic:

* **Time Pressure:** Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely.  Delay heavily favors Bob.
* **Appears Fair:** A 50/50 split makes Bob seem reasonable and could encourage Alice to accept rather than risk an even worse deal as time runs out. 
* **Bob is Still Ahead:** Even with a 50/50 split, Bob is getting a better deal relative to the initial round due to the inflation difference."
