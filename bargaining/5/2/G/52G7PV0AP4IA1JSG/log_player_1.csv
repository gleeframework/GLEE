"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can start fresh!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. Let's get this game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money fairly, I'm happy to take a slightly larger share, but I think this is reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $8,000 is now worth $6,400 (80% of $8,000), and Bob's $2,000 is now worth $1,900 (95% of $2,000).

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll evaluate it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 55/45 split just yet. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation adjustment, my $6,400 is now worth $5,120 (80% of $6,400). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
