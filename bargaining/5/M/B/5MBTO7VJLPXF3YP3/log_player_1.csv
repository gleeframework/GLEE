"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself, which is a 25% share for Bob and a 75% share for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to a fair split, but I'm not giving away too much just yet. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 60% share for myself. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if we can find a better compromise. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share is worth even less, so I need to be careful.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. A 50-50 split seems fair, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money being even less valuable."
