Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the potential for inflation in the next round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's break down why rejecting this offer is the strategic move:

* **Inflation Impact:** Bob's offer is designed to seem appealing because he's emphasizing the inflation risk. However,  the inflation actually hurts him *more* than it hurts you. 
* **Future Rounds:** If you reject this offer, you get to propose in Round 3. In that round, Bob will be even more desperate to settle as the value of the money decreases further for him. 
* **Power of Rejection:** By rejecting this offer, you signal to Bob that you're willing to play the game and that you understand the impact of inflation. This puts you in a stronger position for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Aggressive Stance:**  We're increasing our demand significantly in this round. This reflects the fact that Bob is becoming increasingly desperate as the value of the money plummets for him.
* **Finality:** By framing this as our ""final offer,"" we increase the pressure on Bob.  He knows if he rejects this, the value of the money will decrease even further for him, making any potential deal in the future worse. 
* **Psychological Play:**  While we might be willing to negotiate slightly, taking a strong initial stance in this round could be enough to make Bob accept, especially with the implied threat of further devaluation."
