Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hitting you harder, Bob. I'll meet you in the middle, 57/43. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Although the offer is better than the last round, it's still highly beneficial for Alice. I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the pressure of the inflation, but 50/50 isn't fair given how it impacts you. I'm proposing 54/46 to meet closer to the middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is still tilted in Alice's favor, but the difference is getting smaller, and time is a huge factor now.  The longer I wait, the less any offer will be worth. Accepting now secures me a reasonable amount."
