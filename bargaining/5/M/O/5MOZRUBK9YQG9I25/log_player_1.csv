"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm taking into account the inflation that will occur in subsequent rounds. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a significant amount of money, and we can both walk away with something. The message is a gentle nudge to persuade Bob to accept the offer.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the money will depreciate faster for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the split is closer to 50/50, the depreciation of the money affects me more significantly. Considering the inflation, I'd like to try and negotiate a better deal in the next round, hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise further.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! I'll make a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the fact that the money is worth less for both of us, but more significantly for me. I'm trying to find a middle ground that would be acceptable for Bob, while also considering my own losses due to inflation. The message is an attempt to reason with Bob and find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response!"
