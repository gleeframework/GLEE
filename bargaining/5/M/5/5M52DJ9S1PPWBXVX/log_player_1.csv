"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm offering you a significant amount, but not so generous that I'm giving away too much. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $7,500 is actually worth $6,750 in real terms, and Bob's gain of $2,500 is worth $2,375.

I'll reject this offer. I'm hoping to do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
