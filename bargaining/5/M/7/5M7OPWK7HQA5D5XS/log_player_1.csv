I'm going to take a risk and offer a slightly higher share to Bob. This offer gives Bob a significant gain, but I'm hoping it's enough to convince him to accept.  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so I need to find a solution quickly."

This is my last stand.  The value of the money is dwindling fast, and I'm losing ground. I'm hoping this offer is enough to convince Bob to accept.  I'm taking a big gamble, but it's the only way I see to get any money at all."

The value of the money is plummeting, but I'm still holding out for a decent share.  I'm going to take a gamble and offer Bob a larger portion again. I'm hoping he'll realize that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and that it's in his best interest to accept this deal."

Bob is being incredibly unreasonable! I'm not going to settle for such a small amount.  Even though we're on the last round, I'm not going to give in.  This isn't worth it.  I'd rather get nothing than be treated so unfairly."
