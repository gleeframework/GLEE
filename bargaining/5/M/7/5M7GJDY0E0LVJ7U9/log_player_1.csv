"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that I deserve only $4000, considering I'm the one who made the first offer and proposed a 50/50 split. I think I can do better than that. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away all the profit""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and not giving away too much. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the decreased value of my share 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving Bob a larger share now, especially considering the decreased value of his share due to inflation. I think I can do better than that. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a larger portion for myself. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, I think I can do better than this 
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is determined to negotiate!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure why Bob thinks he can do better, considering the value of his share is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'm not willing to give him a larger share than my previous offer, especially when I'm still getting a decent amount. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being firm and being reasonable. I'm not willing to give Bob a larger share, but I'm willing to give him a slightly smaller one. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up, I'll keep trying to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 6200 
# Bob gain: 3800 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still determined to negotiate!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've been pushing Bob hard enough, and he's still not willing to give up. Considering the rapidly decreasing value of his share due to inflation, I think this offer is a fair compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game."
