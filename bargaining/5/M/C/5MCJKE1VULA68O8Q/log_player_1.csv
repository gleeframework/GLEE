I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money.  Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, it's best to try to get as much as possible in the first round.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm not gaining as much as I initially hoped, it's better to accept this offer.  We don't know how much inflation will affect Bob in future rounds, and it's possible he'll try to take a larger share. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the inflation factor."
