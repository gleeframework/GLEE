"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\n### AI: Round 1\nI have proposed an offer where I, Alice, receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000. Given the impact of inflation, where the value decreases by 5% for me and 10% for Bob with each round, I believe this division is fair. It slightly favors me to compensate for the lesser depreciation of my share over potential future rounds, while still offering Bob a substantial amount considering the steeper depreciation he faces. The message ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact"" aims to convey the reasoning behind my offer, emphasizing fairness and awareness of the game's dynamics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable. This considers the shrinking pot. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\nGiven the adjusted values due to inflation, Bob's offer of $4500 for me and $5500 for himself does reflect the decreasing value of the money. However, considering the steeper decrease in value for Bob (10% each round), I might still have a better position in subsequent rounds. The message ""My turn. Let's be reasonable. This considers the shrinking pot."" indicates Bob's attempt to be fair, but I need to consider the strategic advantage of holding out for a potentially better offer in the next round, especially since the difference in inflation rates could make future offers more advantageous for me.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### AI: Round 2\nI reject Bob's offer to hold out for a potentially better deal in the next round, considering the strategic implications of the differing inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### AI: Round 3\nConsidering the impact of inflation on both our shares, where my share depreciates by 5% and Bob's by 10% each round, I will make an offer that slightly adjusts from the previous round to reflect these changes. My new offer will be $5800 for myself and $4200 for Bob. The message will emphasize the need for a compromise that recognizes the diminishing value of the money for both of us but also takes into account the strategic positioning due to the inflation rates.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, let's adjust our shares fairly""}\n\n### AI: Round 3\nThis offer aims to strike a balance between being fair to both parties while considering the strategic implications of the game's progression and the impact of inflation on our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 4\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our shares, with my potential gain now worth 14.26% less and Bob's worth 27.1% less than in the first round, Bob's offer of $4800 for me and $5200 for himself seems more reasonable. The message ""Time is running out! This is my final offer."" suggests that Bob is not willing to negotiate further, implying that the next round could result in a worse offer or no deal at all. Given the substantial depreciation of the money's value and the risk of ending up with less or nothing if the game continues, I will accept Bob's offer.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### AI: Round 4\nAccepting Bob's offer at this stage seems prudent, considering the diminishing value of the money and the risk of further negotiations not leading to a better outcome."
