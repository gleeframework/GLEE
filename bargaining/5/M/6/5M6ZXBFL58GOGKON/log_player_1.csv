I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000.  Let's see if he's willing to accept a small share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though the inflation hit me harder than Bob, it's still a good deal to get $8,000, especially since the next round would mean I have to offer him a larger share, and the inflation would be even more significant."
