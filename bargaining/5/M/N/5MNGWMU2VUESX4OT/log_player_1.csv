"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob! Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of 70 is actually worth $56.

I'm not too thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 44% less than the original $100 (80% of 80% of 100). Let's calculate my gain in the current round:

$100 * 0.8 * 0.8 = $64

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. A 50-50 split is fair!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up more, but I think I can get a better deal. Your turn again, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 51.2% of the original $100 (52% of 48.8% of 100). Let's calculate my gain in the current round:

$100 * 0.488 * 0.52 = $25.696

However, I'll round this to the nearest whole number, so my gain in the current round is approximately $26.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the 25% gain for me, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 50.24% less than the original $100 (51.2% of 48.8% of 100). Let's calculate my gain in the current round:

However, I'll round this to the nearest whole number, so my gain in the current round is approximately $25.
