Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a 50/50 split, but we need to be realistic. The longer this takes, the less your share is worth. My offer is still a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4875 
# Alice gain: 5125
