600000.0,400000.0,Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly. This offer ensures you get a good chunk while I get slightly more for starting the negotiations.  A fair deal is better than risking it all with inflation!,Alice,1,

450000.0,550000.0,"Your offer was tempting, Alice, but I'm confident I can do slightly better.  How about this: we both walk away with a respectable sum, and you still get a significant share for starting the negotiation. Deal?",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground. However, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, considering I initiated the negotiation. This is a fair offer, and I urge you to accept it before inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Alice,3,
