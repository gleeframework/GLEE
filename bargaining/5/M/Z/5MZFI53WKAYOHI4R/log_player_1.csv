"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was tempting, Alice, but I'm confident I can do slightly better.  How about this: we both walk away with a respectable sum, and you still get a significant share for starting the negotiation. Deal? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, considering I initiated the negotiation. This is a fair offer, and I urge you to accept it before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""
