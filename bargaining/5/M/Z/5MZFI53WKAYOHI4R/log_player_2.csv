Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your attempt to find a middle ground. However, let's be realistic. The longer this goes on, the less we both get. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, considering I initiated the negotiation. This is a fair offer, and I urge you to accept it before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
