"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us""}\n\nI made an offer to divide the money 60-40 in my favor, with a message trying to convince Bob that this is a fair deal. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fair, considering your offer in the previous round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, and I'm not willing to accept 40% of the money, especially since the value of the money is decreasing for me faster than for Bob. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55-45 is a reasonable compromise. Let's settle this!""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer Bob a slightly better deal than before, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's still a relatively good deal for me, and I don't want the value of the money to decrease further. Let's see how Bob responds!"
