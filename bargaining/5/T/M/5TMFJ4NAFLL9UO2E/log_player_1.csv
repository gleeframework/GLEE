"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split, I'll give you 10, I'll take 90. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 10% of the initial $100, and I'll take the remaining 90%. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can start the negotiations from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll give you 50, I'll take 50. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, and Bob's offer is to give me 50, which is 50% of the current value, I'll have to calculate the actual amount I'll receive.

Current total value of money = $100 * (0.9)^2 = $81

So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 50% of $81, which is $40.50

I'll accept Bob's offer.
