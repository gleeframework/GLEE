Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves a significant amount for Bob. I'm hoping this is fair enough for him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is already starting to impact the value of the money.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer in the next round."
