"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for haggling""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting 4000, which is worth 10% less than my original 5000, and Bob will get 6000, which is the same as his original proposal. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway, but still trying to get a fair share""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, and I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really eating into my potential earnings! 

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although I'm getting closer to my original target, I still think I can do better. The difference between 4200 and 4500 is relatively small, and I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really taking its toll now! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4900,
  ""bob_gain"": 5100,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to the 50-50 split, but I'm not there yet""
}
```

I'm trying to inch closer to the 50-50 split, but I'm not willing to give up too much more to Bob."
