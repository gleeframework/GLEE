Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that time is running out (and money is rapidly losing value), her offer is still tilted in her favor considering the inflation disproportionately affects her.  I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a bad deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Every round costs us money!"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

By round 6, the inflation is starting to become very significant. Offering a 50/50 split: 

* **Demonstrates fairness:** It shows Alice I'm willing to compromise and recognize that dragging this out hurts us both. 
* **Simplicity:** A clean split avoids further complicated negotiations as time runs out.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes that we need to decide *now* before the money value drops even more."
