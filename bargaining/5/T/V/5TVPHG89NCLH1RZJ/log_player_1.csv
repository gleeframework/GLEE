"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself, arguing that it's a fair split considering the inflation penalties we'll both face if we don't come to an agreement soon. Waiting to hear back from Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share this time, but I need a little more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my share should be bigger""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $430,000 and keeping $570,000 for myself, arguing that since the money is worth less with each passing round, I should get a bigger share to make up for the loss. Waiting to hear back from Bob!"
