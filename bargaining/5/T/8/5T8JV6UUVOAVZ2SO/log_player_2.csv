"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it closer to even, but I need a little more to make it worth my while.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to even, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer I hold out, the more the inflation hurts her offer.  I need to push for a more equitable split while time is on my side."
