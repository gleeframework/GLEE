I propose to keep 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This is a fair offer considering the inflation that will affect me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I offer Bob 400,000 dollars, and I take 600,000.  This is still a better deal for me considering the inflation that will impact me in the next round, and also offers a significant gain for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a tough choice, but I have to accept.  While the money I gain is significantly less due to inflation, it's better than getting nothing."
