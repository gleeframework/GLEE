"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! Don't be greedy!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still get 2000 dollars, which is a good deal. But I was hoping to get more.
