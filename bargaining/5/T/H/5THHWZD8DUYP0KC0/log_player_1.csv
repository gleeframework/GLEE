"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60/40 in my favor, which means I'll get $60 and Bob will get $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a slightly more even split.  Let's be fair, but also get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a more even split!

Considering the new values due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 45 * 0.95 (since my gain is worth 5% less) = 42.75
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.9 (since Bob's gain is worth 10% less) = 49.5

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, which is a slightly more even split than my initial offer, but still in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
