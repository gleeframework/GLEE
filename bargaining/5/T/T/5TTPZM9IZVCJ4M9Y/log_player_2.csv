""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was kind, but ultimately doesn't benefit me as much as it does you. Let's be pragmatic: I'll take a larger share this round, understanding the value decreases quickly for both of us as time passes.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share. However, your offer doesn't account for the rapid devaluation of your potential gains. Let's be reasonable: I'll take a little less than my initial offer, which is still more beneficial for you than waiting. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
