"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that Bob will have to consider the potential loss of value in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than what I offered in the first round, I believe I can do better. I will reject and see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
``` 

I'm going to offer a 70/30 split in my favor.  While the value of the money has decreased for both of us, I still think I can get a more favorable deal than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is not great, the inflation is hitting me hard, and I risk losing more by rejecting. I'll accept this offer."
