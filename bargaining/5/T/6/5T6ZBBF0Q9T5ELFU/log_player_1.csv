Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  I'm hoping Bob will be greedy and take it, but if not, I'll have time to adjust my strategy over the next 12 rounds.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite generous to me, even with the inflation factored in. While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money.  It's also a good sign that Bob is willing to negotiate, so I'm hoping we can find a more balanced split in the future if the game continues."
