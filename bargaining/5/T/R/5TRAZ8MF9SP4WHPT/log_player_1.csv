# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking. The offer is still a bit lopsided, but I'm tempted by the promise of a ""good deal"".

I'll decide to...
