"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself, with a message suggesting this is a fair split. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split this down the middle. It's the fairest way. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I still want a larger share. Plus, Bob's share will be worth less due to inflation, so I have some leverage to negotiate for more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 610000, ""bob_gain"": 390000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $390,000 and keep $610,000 for myself, with a message pointing out that I'm being generous considering the inflation that's affecting Bob's share."
