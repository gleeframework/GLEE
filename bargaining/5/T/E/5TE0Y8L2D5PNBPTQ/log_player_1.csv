"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60, I'll meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since Bob is meeting me halfway, it means he's willing to give me 30, which is 15% of the initial $100. I'm not getting as much as I wanted, but it's a decent compromise.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
