"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not sure if I want to give up $400,000 (in value) to Bob, considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $550,000 and Bob $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

This offer is almost identical to my previous one, but I think I'll accept it since it's a fair split and I don't want to risk going to another round with even more inflation."
