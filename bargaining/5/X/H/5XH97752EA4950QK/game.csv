55.0,45.0,"Bob, time is running out and our money is losing value. I think my previous offer of 55/45 is very reasonable. Let's close this deal and avoid losing more.",Alice,3,

48.0,52.0,I'm willing to compromise.  Let's go with a 52/48 split.  This ensures we both get a good share while also minimizing the risk of losing everything.,Bob,4,

51.0,49.0,"Bob, we're getting dangerously close to losing a significant chunk of money. I'm proposing a 51/49 split. It's a slight edge for me, but it ensures we both leave with something substantial.",Alice,5,
