"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to set the tone for the game. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be reasonable, Alice. This is a one-time counter offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers""
}\n\nI've taken into account the inflation and the fact that Bob was willing to give me 475000 in the previous round, so I'm trying to find a middle ground. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm standing my ground. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\nI think it's time to stop the bleeding from inflation. Since Bob claims this is their final offer, I don't want to risk losing even more value. I'll take the 487500, which is still a decent amount considering the circumstances."
