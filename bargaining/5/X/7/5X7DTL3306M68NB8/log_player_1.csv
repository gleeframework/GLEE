"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd gain $4,000 and he'd gain $6,000. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'd be getting a better deal than I initially proposed. I'll accept this offer.
