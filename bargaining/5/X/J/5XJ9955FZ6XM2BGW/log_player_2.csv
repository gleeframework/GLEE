"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the bigger share but you still get something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a terrible deal for Bob, even in the first round. Alice's offer will only get worse with inflation working heavily in Bob's favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but this split is much fairer considering the inflation working against you."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but this is the best I can do considering the inflation. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation, but she's losing value far quicker than Bob.  While her offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid devaluation of her potential winnings.  Bob has time to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This offer is more than fair considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close to the end, Bob. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a great outcome for Bob! While he was pushing for a higher share, getting 50/50 at this stage means he's actually getting significantly more of the original value due to the inflation working in his favor. Alice is finally making a rational decision, and it's in Bob's best interest to accept before she changes her mind or time runs out."
