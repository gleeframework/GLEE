"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see how it goes from here!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly higher percentage this time, but I'm not going to give up too much ground 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking its toll, I'm not getting as much value as I was in the first round.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough. I'd like to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation still affecting the value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I'm not getting any younger. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to add up! With the money being worth significantly less, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 45/55 split, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of the money continuing to drop, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value.
