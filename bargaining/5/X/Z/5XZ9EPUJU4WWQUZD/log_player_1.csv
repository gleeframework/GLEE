"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. This is a generous offer to start, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 8000 for me and 2000 for Bob. While I want to be fair, I need to account for the inflation impacting Bob more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the dwindling rounds. 7000 for me and 3000 for Bob seems fair considering the inflation impacting Bob more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

We are running out of time, and I need to secure some of the money. I'm offering 6000 for me and 4000 for Bob. This is a reasonable offer, especially considering the impact of inflation on Bob."
