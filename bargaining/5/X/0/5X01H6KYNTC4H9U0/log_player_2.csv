Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not giving in, you're losing more than me 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting worse, I still lose significantly more than Alice due to the inflation rate. It's a gamble, but holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds is still the more logical choice. Alice's taunting suggests she might be getting nervous, which could work in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop this. A fair 50/50 split is the best way to end this before we both lose out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is really starting to hurt, and it's becoming less likely Alice will offer anything better than this.  A 50/50 split is fair, and while it means accepting a loss compared to the first round, it's better than risking getting zero by the end. This offer emphasizes the risk to both of us if we don't make a deal."
