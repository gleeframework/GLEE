"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already reduced the value of the money, so I need to be more cautious with my decision.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than $6,000. I'm hoping to get more in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to get closer to an agreement, I'm willing to meet you halfway!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $7,000 and leaving $3,000 for Bob. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's try to find a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money, and I need to be careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a 50-50 split, which is a relatively even distribution of the remaining funds. Given the decreasing value of the money, I'm inclined to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
