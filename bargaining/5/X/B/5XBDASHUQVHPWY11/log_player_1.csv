"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to set the tone for a fair negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair, let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, the actual amounts I would gain are:

* My gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5
* Bob's gain: 50

I'm not sure if this is the best I can do, but I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
