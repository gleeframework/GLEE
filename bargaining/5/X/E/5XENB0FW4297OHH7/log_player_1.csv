"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can get more if you wait, but the longer you wait, the less you'll get 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 80% of the original value, which is 3200 dollars. Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 96% of the original value, which is 5760 dollars.

I'm not sure if I should wait for a better offer, but Bob's message suggests that the longer I wait, the less I'll get. I'll decide to reject this offer and hope for a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of the original value (80% of 80% = 64%). I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a significant portion, but I need something in return""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm still not giving in 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 3000 is worth 64% of the original value, which is now 1920 dollars (64% of 3000). Bob's gain of 7000 is worth 84% of the original value, which is 8400 dollars.

I'm starting to get desperate, but I don't want to give up yet. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 40.96% of the original value (64% of 64% = 40.96%). I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2400,
  ""bob_gain"": 7600,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting low on options, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm offering Bob an even larger share, but I'm getting close to my breaking point."
