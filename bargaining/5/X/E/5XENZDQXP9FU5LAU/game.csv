6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $6000, you get $4000.  The money loses value quickly for both of us if we wait.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it evenly - I'll take $5000, and you get $5000. It's a fair deal, and we can avoid losing more money to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, that's still not fair considering the money is losing value faster for you. How about $5500 for me and $4500 for you? Let's settle this before we both lose out.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be reasonable, Alice. Inflation is affecting us both.  $5000 each is a fair compromise.  If we keep rejecting each other's offers, we'll both end up with less.",Bob,4,
