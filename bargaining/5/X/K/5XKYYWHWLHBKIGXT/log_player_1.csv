"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer to start with. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. That seems fair, wouldn't you agree? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to be fair and split the money evenly. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I was hoping to get a slightly higher share, and 50-50 seems a bit too equal for me. Now it's my turn to make the next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself this time. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""A slight edge for me, but still a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, hoping that Bob will consider it a reasonable compromise."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time we both got a little closer to a 50/50 split. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to adjust the split to get closer to 50-50. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I was hoping to get a slightly higher share, and 45-55 is still a bit too far from my target. I'll try to make another offer that gets me closer to my desired share."

Round 5

  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, but don't expect me to give up much more!""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
