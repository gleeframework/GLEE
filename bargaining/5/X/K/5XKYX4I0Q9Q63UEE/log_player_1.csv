"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered me 20%, now I'll offer you 10% 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You offered me 10%, now I'll offer you 40%. I think this is a more balanced split.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but still keep a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered me 40%, now I'll offer a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully. A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money continuing to lose value."
