"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. You get a small share now, but I'll keep the lion's share. We can renegotiate later if you're unhappy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's think about this strategically. While $100,000 is a significant amount of money, accepting this offer puts me at a huge disadvantage. Alice is clearly banking on me being swayed by the immediate payout. 

Here's why I should reject:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money decreases with each round, hurting Alice more than me. Her offer will be worth significantly less if I reject it now.
* **Negotiating Power:** By rejecting this offer, I signal that I'm not easily manipulated and am willing to fight for a fairer share. This gives me more leverage in the next round.

I believe I can secure a much better deal by waiting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. I understand you want a larger share, but I control this round. This offer is more than generous considering the inflation working against you. Take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Strategy:**

* **Strong Opening:** This offer immediately establishes a favorable position. It's unlikely Alice will accept the previous 10/90 split after seeing I'm willing to forgo a significant sum for a fairer deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  By using phrases like ""Let's be realistic"" and ""Take it or leave it,"" I'm emphasizing the urgency of the situation due to the decreasing value of the money. 
* **Appearing Firm:** While I'm open to negotiation in future rounds, I want to project confidence in this offer. This might push Alice to accept, fearing an even lower offer later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  This offer is fairer to both of us, considering the inflation. Let's end this game and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is now much more reasonable. Here's why accepting makes sense:

* **Significant Improvement:** Alice has moved from a 90/10 split to a 60/40 split. This shows she understands the impact of inflation and my unwillingness to accept a lowball offer. 
* **Limited Future Gains:** While I might be able to squeeze a bit more out of Alice in another round, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk. There's no guarantee she'll offer more than 40% in the future.
* **Time Value:** Every round that passes diminishes the overall value of the money, even for me. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting a marginally better deal later with less overall value. 

Accepting this offer guarantees a fair share of the money and avoids further risk."
