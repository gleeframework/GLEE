Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's call it even. I'm willing to split the money 50/50.  We both get a fair share, and we avoid further rounds of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
