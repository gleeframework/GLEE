Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob might accept it to avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to have more, accepting this offer is the best option. Bob's offer is fair, and if I reject it, I risk him proposing a worse deal in the next round. The risk of inflation on Bob's side means I'm unlikely to get a better deal."
