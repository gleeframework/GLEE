  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,

}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer on the table, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially considering the value of the money has already decreased due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:
