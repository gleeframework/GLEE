"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose a division of $99 for myself and $1 for Bob. This is a bold strategy, but I'm banking on Bob being willing to accept a small amount to avoid potentially losing more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, it's likely that Bob will propose even less for me in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me $70, which is better than risking getting a smaller share or even nothing in the following rounds."
