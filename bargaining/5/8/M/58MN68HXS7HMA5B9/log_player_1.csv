"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose to keep 900,000$ for myself and give 100,000$ to Bob.  This way, we both get a sizable portion, and I can maximize my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to get more, I'm willing to accept this offer. I'm worried that if I reject, inflation will continue to devalue the money, and we could both end up with nothing in the end."
