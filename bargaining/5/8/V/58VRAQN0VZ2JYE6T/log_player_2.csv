"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the fact that the money loses value faster for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money loses value faster for me, I'd like to try to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping she'll consider the fact that the money is losing value faster for me and accept this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases rapidly for you, and this offer still gives you something. It's better to take it now than risk getting even less later. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll take my chances and make another offer in the next round. Given the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me, I'm not satisfied with Alice's proposal.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal despite the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, I believe this split is more reasonable. It's in both our interests to conclude this soon.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm emphasizing the urgency due to the rapid loss of value on my end."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  The money is practically worthless to you at this point. Take this deal while you can still get something! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the extreme devaluation of the money for me, Alice's offer seems to be the best option at this point. Continuing further would likely result in even less value for me, so it's prudent to accept this deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease conclude the game with Alice's offer from round 5."
