"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80 dollars and leave 20 dollars for Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more equitable.  I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but we're both getting closer to a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 45 dollars is actually worth 40.5 dollars (90% of 45). I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not proceed to the next round if I can get a better deal now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my gain of 40.5 dollars is now worth 36.45 dollars (90% of 40.5).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 50/50""
}
```

I'm now offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
