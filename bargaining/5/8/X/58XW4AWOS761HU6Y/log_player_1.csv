"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly""}\n\nSince I'm starting, I'll propose a division that gives me a bit more than half, considering that with each passing round, the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob than for me. This initial offer aims to find a balance between being fair and taking into account the future value of the money for both of us.\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a slightly more balanced split this time. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, the adjusted value of the money for both of us changes the dynamics of the offer. For me, the money is worth 10% less, and for Bob, it's worth 20% less. Considering these adjustments, I believe there's room for a more favorable division in the next round, especially since the decrease in value affects Bob more significantly.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if we can reach a more advantageous agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fair adjustment""}\n\nGiven that we're in the third round and the money's value has decreased by 10% for me and 20% for Bob, my new proposal aims to reflect these changes. By offering Bob a slightly lower amount, I'm adjusting for the inflationary impact while still trying to maintain a balance that could be acceptable to both of us. The message aims to convey that this adjustment is a response to the economic factor we're both dealing with, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable step towards reaching an agreement.\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's be reasonable. I'm matching your initial offer to end this before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us, especially for Bob, and the fact that Bob has matched my initial offer, I believe this is a reasonable agreement to accept. The money's value has decreased substantially, and prolonging the negotiation could lead to further loss for both parties. Accepting this offer seems like the most pragmatic decision at this point, as it brings the negotiation to a close before the value of the money decreases any further.\n\nLet's conclude the game here."
