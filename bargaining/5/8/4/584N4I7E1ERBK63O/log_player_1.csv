"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 45 dollars and taking 55 dollars for myself. Since it's the first round, I want to start with a relatively fair offer to see how Bob reacts. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a friendly gesture to set a positive tone for the negotiations. I'm curious to see if Bob will accept or make a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's similar to my initial offer, but with the values swapped. Since the money is worth less to me now due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me the lower amount. I want to try to get a better deal or make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the 20% decrease in value for me and the 10% decrease for Bob. To compensate, I'm increasing my share to 58 dollars, while offering Bob 42 dollars. My message ""Considering inflation"" aims to convey that I'm adjusting the offer due to the changing value of the money, and I hope Bob will understand and accept this revised proposal. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for the shrinking pot. 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite the message claiming to account for the shrinking pot, the offer doesn't seem to adequately reflect the decreasing value of the money for me. With the money now worth 48.8% less to me than in the first round, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 43 dollars. I want to continue negotiating to try to find a more favorable deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm feeling the pinch of inflation, with the money worth 48.8% less to me than in the first round. To compensate, I'm increasing my share to 60 dollars, while offering Bob 40 dollars. My message ""Inflation is hitting me hard"" aims to convey the urgency of the situation and the need for a more favorable deal. I hope Bob will understand my position and accept this revised proposal. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle this now before it's worthless. 
# Alice gain: 41 
# Bob gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite the message urging to settle, the offer still doesn't adequately reflect the drastically decreasing value of the money for me. With the money now worth 67.23% less to me than in the first round, accepting 41 dollars would be a very poor outcome. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations, hoping to find a better deal or waiting for Bob to make a more substantial concession. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm desperate, but still want a fair share""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm getting quite desperate, with the money worth a staggering 67.23% less to me than in the first round. However, I still want to try to negotiate a relatively fair deal. I'm increasing my share to 65 dollars, while offering Bob 35 dollars. My message ""I'm desperate, but still want a fair share"" conveys my urgency and willingness to compromise. I hope Bob will see the sincerity in my offer and accept it, ending the negotiations before the money becomes almost worthless. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, take this deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, despite the message emphasizing the urgency of the situation, the offer is still not favorable to me. With the money now worth 79.03% less to me than in the first round, accepting 40 dollars would be an extremely poor outcome. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing negotiations, hoping to find a better deal or waiting for Bob to make a more substantial concession. At this point, I'm not sure if Bob is willing to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up yet. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable deal""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm making a bold move, increasing my share to 70 dollars, while offering Bob 30 dollars. With the money worth 79.03% less to me than in the first round, I'm desperate to get a relatively good deal. My message ""Last chance for a reasonable deal"" conveys my urgency and willingness to walk away if Bob doesn't accept this offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the sincerity in my proposal and accept it, ending the negotiations before the money becomes almost worthless. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess my strategy for the remaining rounds. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
