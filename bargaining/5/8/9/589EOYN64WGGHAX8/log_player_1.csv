"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my 40 dollars is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to $38. But I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, since Bob is getting a larger share of the total amount.

I'll reject the offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for myself this time, but I'm still willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. With the offer from Bob, my 35 dollars would be worth only about 85% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to around $34.25.

Considering the current state of the economy, I think this offer is a good opportunity for me to get a decent share of the remaining money. I'll accept Bob's offer.
