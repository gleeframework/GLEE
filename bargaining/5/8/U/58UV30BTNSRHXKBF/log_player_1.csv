Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. If you reject it, we'll both lose more in the next round. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation. While his offer seems tempting as the deadline approaches, accepting it would mean settling for significantly less than my initial offer in Round 1.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and this is the most straightforward way to split the money. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is increasingly impacting my potential gains. While I want a better deal than Bob's previous offer, it's time to make a strong stance and propose an even 50/50 split. This emphasizes fairness and puts the pressure on Bob, as further delays will hurt us both."
