Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for a long game.""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 70% 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.
