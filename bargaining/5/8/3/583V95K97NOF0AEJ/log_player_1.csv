"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose Alice gets $9000 and Bob gets $1000.  I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives Bob a small incentive to accept, but still leaves the majority of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to reduce my share slightly to 8000, but increase Bob's share to 2000. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still maintain a significant portion of the money. Since the inflation is only affecting Bob's share, I think this is a good deal for both of us."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm further reducing my share to 7000, but increasing Bob's share to 3000. Bob's share is getting reduced due to inflation, so I'm trying to compensate for that to make the deal more attractive while still retaining a larger part."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's frustrating to get such a small share, with each round passing, Bob's share is being significantly reduced by inflation.  Accepting this offer is the best option to get some money at all."
