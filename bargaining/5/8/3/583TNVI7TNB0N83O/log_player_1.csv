"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money with a 70/30 ratio. This seems fair considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 40/60 split is a more reasonable ratio, considering the value of money will continue to decrease for me. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
