Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was quite cheeky!  Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Consider that with inflation, waiting any longer will only hurt us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
