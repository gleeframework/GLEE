"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going for a slightly uneven split in my favor, knowing that Bob has no information about the inflation factor. This might encourage him to accept the offer early on, before the inflation effect becomes too significant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take something,  knowing that the money is losing value with each round, it's too risky to accept such a lopsided split this early in the game. I'll push for a more equitable division in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share, but still keeping it above 50%.  Bob rejected my previous offer and is likely to be more cautious now, but the inflation factor is starting to affect the value of the money. I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him."
