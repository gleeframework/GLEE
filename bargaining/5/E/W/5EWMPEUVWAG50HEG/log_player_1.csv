"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me taking 90 dollars and Bob taking 10.  It's a fair starting point that gives Bob a decent share.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, especially since I don't know how much inflation is affecting Bob. Accepting this offer is the safest way to ensure I get something."
