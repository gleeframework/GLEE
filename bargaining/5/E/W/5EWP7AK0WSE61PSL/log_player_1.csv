"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money with a ratio of 7:3. This way, I'm getting a slightly larger share considering the inflation factor.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split in our favor.  This is fairer considering the inflation factor, and allows us both to get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
