"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob is a 50-50 split, which is a fair one.
