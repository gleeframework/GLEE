"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This is a much better deal for you than the next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll reduce my share a bit, let's compromise 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""This is a fair offer considering the inflation. I'm willing to be reasonable, but time is running out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and your last offer 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob.  While she's trying to compromise, her offers are still heavily skewed in her favor in the early rounds. By rejecting this offer, Bob reinforces that he's aware of the inflation dynamic and is willing to push for a better deal as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a smaller share, but still more than your last offer 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning in Bob's favor.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot, even if her decrease in share is slow. Bob can afford to play hardball for another round or two, aiming for at least an even split or slightly better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  It's the fairest option, and we're running out of time.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to push for an even split.  While Bob could potentially squeeze out a bit more in the next round or two, there's a risk that Alice might panic as the rounds dwindle and offer even less favorable terms. An even split is a clean and justifiable outcome at this stage."
