"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very uneven split in the first round.  I want to see if Bob is risk-averse or if he's willing to gamble on getting a better offer later.  I'm also trying to set a precedent of being the dominant player in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to have more than 500,000, given the inflation factor, and the fact that Bob is willing to split the money evenly, it's in my best interest to accept this offer. It's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob will make a similar offer in subsequent rounds, and the inflation will continue to erode my share."
