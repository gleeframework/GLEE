"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 60/40 split.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for Alice, so I have some leverage to negotiate. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation that affects Alice's valuation of the money. This way, I'm trying to find a mutually acceptable division."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to address the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation that affects Alice's valuation, I believe I can negotiate for a slightly better deal. The fact that the money is worth 19% less for Alice gives me some room to push for a bit more.\n\n###\n\nLet's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on your end, I think a 58/42 split is a reasonable adjustment.""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the money is now worth 19% less for Alice, I'll try to negotiate a slightly better deal for myself while still being mindful of finding a mutually acceptable division. The goal is to find a balance that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Alice."
