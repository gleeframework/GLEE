"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob. No need to negotiate, let's just take half each.""
}
```

This way, we both get a fair and equal share, and we can avoid any potential disagreements or inflation worries."
