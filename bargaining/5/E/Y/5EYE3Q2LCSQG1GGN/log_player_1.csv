"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share this round, but I'll give you a better deal later. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll receive $30, but it's equivalent to $24 in the first round's value.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split, especially with the promise of a better deal later. I'd like to negotiate further and aim for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the second round, I'll receive $24, but it's equivalent to $18 in the first round's value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, with me getting 45 dollars and Bob getting 55 dollars. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on the split, but I'm willing to give you a smaller share now to get a better deal later. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I'll receive $20, but it's equivalent to $10.40 in the first round's value.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20/80 split, especially with the promise of a better deal later. I'm starting to think that Bob is trying to wear me down with low offers and is not serious about making a fair deal. I'd like to try to negotiate a better split or make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll receive $10.40, but it's equivalent to $5.12 in the first round's value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging on the 50/50 split. Let's end this game fairly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with me getting 50 dollars and Bob getting 50 dollars. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
