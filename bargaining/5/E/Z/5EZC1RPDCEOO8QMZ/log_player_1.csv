"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose that I take 90 dollars and Bob takes 10 dollars.  This is a good starting point as it ensures a large portion of the money goes to me, but still offers Bob something to consider accepting.  We'll see if he's willing to play along!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a huge swing in his favor. While the money is worth less due to inflation, it's still not worth accepting such a drastic change.  I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, which is still a significant amount of money. I'm hoping that Bob will realize that continuing to reject offers will lead to both of us losing more money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even worse than his last one! This inflation is really biting, but I'm still not willing to accept such a lopsided deal.  I'll see if I can push for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. It's clear that we're not going to be able to get a more favorable deal for either of us at this point. Inflation is really hitting hard now. Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise and accept this fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly ridiculous. While the value of the money is declining rapidly, I'm still not willing to accept such a small amount. I'll keep trying to negotiate a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm offering a 40/60 split in Bob's favor.  While inflation is taking its toll, I'm willing to make a concession to try and get a deal done.  We're running out of time, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is absurd.  While the value of the money is dropping dramatically, I refuse to settle for such a small amount.  I'll keep trying to negotiate a fairer deal.  We're running out of time, but I won't be taken advantage of."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}
```

I'm offering a 30/70 split in Bob's favor. We're down to the wire now and I'm trying to be as reasonable as possible while still securing something for myself. It's a gamble, but with inflation hitting us hard, it might be our best chance to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is ridiculous!  I won't accept such a paltry sum.  Even with the declining value of the money, I'm not going to be taken advantage of like this.  I'll counter his offer in the next round, even if it means we both get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 20, ""bob_gain"": 80}
```

This is my final offer.  We're down to the wire, and the value of the money is practically worthless.  I'm willing to take a significant loss, but I won't accept anything less.  Let's see if Bob is finally willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 91.41% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0.01 
# Bob gain: 99.99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is outrageous!  Bob's offer is insulting. Even though the value of the money is almost nothing, I refuse to accept such a ridiculously lopsided deal.  It's better to walk away with nothing than to be treated with such disrespect. We both lose in the end, but at least I stand by my principles."
