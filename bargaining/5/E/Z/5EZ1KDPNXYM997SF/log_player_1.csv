I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with something to hopefully make him think about accepting. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, I'm worried that if I reject, the inflation will make my potential gains in future rounds much lower. This offer is a fair split, and I'll take it."
