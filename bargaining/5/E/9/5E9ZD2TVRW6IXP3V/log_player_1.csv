"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, and hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth even less.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

I'm not too thrilled about giving up a large majority of the money, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.
