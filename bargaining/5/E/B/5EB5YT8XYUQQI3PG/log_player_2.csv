"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can both be happy with that. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With 20% inflation, the value of the money will decrease, but I'm hoping to get a better deal than 10%. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more reasonable than Alice's initial proposal. Since the value of the money has decreased by 20% due to inflation, the total value is now $800,000. I'll offer Alice 60% of the original amount, which is $600,000, and I'll take 40%, which is $400,000. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}"
