While Alice's offer seems fair, I can likely get a better deal for myself since I only lose 5% of the money's value each round, while she loses 10%."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is closer to my ideal split, I still think I can get a slightly better deal with more rounds. I'm not yet ready to settle."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm sticking to my position that I should get a larger share due to the different inflation rates. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid further rounds of negotiation.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it down the middle, last fair offer 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is becoming increasingly attractive due to the inflation rate.  It's a fair deal, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
