This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates. I'm aiming to get a larger share of the money, but I'm also willing to compromise to avoid the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer to get more, this offer is still advantageous considering the inflation. The reduction in value means I'll get less than 6000, and Bob will get less than 4000.  It's a fair split and it avoids the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
