"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, leaving $300,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now it's my turn to make a big cut! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, I didn't expect Bob to cut me down so low!

Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $100,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is equivalent to $80,000 in the first round. That's a big cut!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my proposal for Round 3 will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, now it's my turn to take control! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, it seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me dry!

Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $50,000 is worth 50.8% of what it was in the first round, which is equivalent to $408,000 in the first round. That's a huge cut!

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or try to negotiate further...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the previous round, my proposal for Round 5 will be:

  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to hold on, but I need something reasonable. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 25-75 split, hoping Bob will show some mercy and give me a slightly better deal."
