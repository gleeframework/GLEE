"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4,000 and keep $6,000. We can discuss further if you'd like.""
}
```

This offer gives Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and me $6,000, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your starting offer, but I believe I deserve a bit more.  Let's flip it - I'll take $6000, and you can have $4000.  This way, we both get something closer to what we might consider fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll need to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If Bob's offer is $6,000 for him and $4,000 for me, that's equivalent to 60% of the original amount for him and 40% of the original amount for me.

Considering the inflation, I'll calculate the actual values:

* My gain: $4,000 / 0.9 (10% inflation) = $4,444.44
* Bob's gain: $6,000 / 0.8 (20% inflation) = $7,500

I'm not convinced that this offer is fair, considering the inflation rates. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you $5,800 and keep $4,200. It's a bit more generous than my previous offer.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation rates, and I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share to try to reach a agreement."
