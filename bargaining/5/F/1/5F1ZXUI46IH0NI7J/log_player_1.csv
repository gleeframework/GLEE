Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a large share but also gives Bob a decent amount to potentially agree to.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  I've already lost 20% of my potential earnings due to inflation.  Accepting ensures I get at least half the remaining value, which is better than potentially getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
