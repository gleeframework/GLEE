"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money fairly, or I can try to negotiate further.""
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's still a relatively fair split. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a fair split. This is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This split seems fair, and I'm willing to end the game here."
