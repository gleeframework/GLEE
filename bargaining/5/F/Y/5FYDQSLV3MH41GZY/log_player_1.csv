Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm not giving up. I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get a better deal. This is my final offer, and if you reject it, you'll have to deal with the consequences of your greed. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70

This is a tough spot. While I'd prefer to get a better deal, Bob is clearly willing to gamble on a worse outcome for both of us.  Accepting his offer guarantees me $30. If I reject it, there's a chance I might get nothing in a later round if Bob decides to propose keeping everything for himself. It's a risky gamble I'm not willing to take at this point."
