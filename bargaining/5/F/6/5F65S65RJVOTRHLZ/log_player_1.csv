"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's end the game now!""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take 40, I'll take 60. It's a fair offer, don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, my gain of $40 is actually worth $36 (since 90% of $40 is $36).

I don't think this is a very generous offer, considering the value of money is decreasing. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so my gain is worth 10% less than $36, which is $32.40 (since 90% of $36 is $32.40).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you the majority, but I need a bit more than 30. Make a better offer or accept this one!""
}
```

I'm trying to be reasonable, but I'm not giving up too much yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a bit less than 25, but that's my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of $25 is actually worth $18.25 (since 72.9% of $25 is $18.25).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept it.
