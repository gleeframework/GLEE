"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 70-30""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70$ and Bob will get 30$. I'm starting with a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate and give me a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 84% of the original amount, so I'll get 70 * 0.8 = 56$.

Bob's gain is worth 95% of the original amount, so he'll get 30 * 0.95 = 28.5$.

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a fair 50-50 split.
