"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair for me to get a bit more this round, but I'm still open to negotiation! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current state of the game.
We are in Round 3, and due to inflation, the money's value decreases by 10% with each round. The initial $100 is now worth less.

### Step 2: Analyze the previous offers.
In Round 1, I (Alice) offered to take $55 and give Bob $45, which Bob rejected. In Round 2, Bob offered me $45 and wanted $55 for himself, which I rejected.

### Step 3: Determine the strategy for Round 3.
Given the decreasing value of money and the history of rejections, it's crucial to find a balance that might be acceptable to Bob while still benefiting me. Aiming for a slightly more favorable division than the last offer but still appearing fair is key.

### Step 4: Calculate the offer for Round 3.
Considering the rejection of the 55-45 split in my favor and the decreasing value of money, offering a split closer to 50-50 might be more appealing to Bob, but given the history, aiming slightly higher than the last offer but still being mindful of the need for acceptance might mean offering a bit more to myself but less than initially offered.

### Step 5: Formulate the offer and message.
Offering a slight increase from the last rejected offer but still being ""fair"" could mean offering myself $52 and Bob $48. The message should convey a sense of compromise and urgency due to the decreasing value of money.

### Step 6: Prepare the offer in the required JSON format.
Given the strategy and calculations, the offer should be formatted as follows:

{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Compromising, considering inflation.""}

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Compromising, considering inflation.""}"
