"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A slight advantage for me in the first round seems reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember that the money is losing value each round. Rejecting allows me to propose a deal in the next round, potentially getting more than $4,500."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly, Alice.  It's the fairest deal, and we both get a decent share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and we both lose with every round.  I'll adjust my offer slightly for a faster agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too favorable to her, considering the inflation factor. I'll keep rejecting until I can secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be flexible but I can't accept a deal that heavily favors you. This offer is closer to a fair split, considering the inflation factor. Let's reach an agreement before we both lose too much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal, but the clock is ticking.  This offer is a compromise, and accepting now is better than losing value in further rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's tempting to accept to avoid further inflation, Alice's offer still heavily favors her. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and achieve a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round.  This offer is closer to an even split than your last one. Let's find a compromise before the value of our gains diminishes further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is a very slight advantage for me, and realistically the closest we'll get to a deal. Let's settle this now before the inflation eats further into the pot. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is getting severe, and Alice's offer is the closest we've gotten to an even split.  It's time to accept and secure a decent share before the value of our gains dwindles further."
