"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money relatively evenly, Bob. This offer is a good deal for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Strong:** It's generally a good strategy to begin with a somewhat reasonable offer, even if it slightly favors Alice. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome.
* **Inflation Factor:** The inflation rate is crucial here. Money loses value faster for Alice (10%) than for Bob (5%).  Therefore, Alice needs to secure a decent amount early on.
* **Psychology:** The message is designed to be non-confrontational and appealing to a sense of fairness. By highlighting the mutual benefit, Alice hopes to make the offer more enticing for Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move. How Bob responds will heavily influence Alice's strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, Alice, but this is more reflective of the decreasing value over time.  Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is designed to sound reasonable but is actually quite cunning. Here's why Alice should reject it:

* **Shifting the Blame:** Bob subtly frames his offer as a concession to Alice's supposed greed (""you want a larger share""). This is a tactic to make his offer seem more generous than it is.
* **Unfavorable Split:**  While Bob's offer appears close to even, the inflation difference means Alice is actually getting a much worse deal over time. Accepting this offer would lock Alice into a losing position. 
* **Future Leverage:**  Rejecting this offer shows Bob that Alice is serious about getting a fair deal and won't be pressured by time constraints. This gives Alice more leverage in the next round.

**It's important to note:** By rejecting this offer, Alice is taking a risk. The money will be worth even less in the next round. However, it's a calculated risk, as Bob's offer is already unacceptable given the inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for us. I'm proposing a split that acknowledges the decreasing value but still offers a fair deal. Let's wrap this up.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice is slightly reducing her demand from the initial offer (550,000 to 510,000) to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to settle. 
* **Inflation Awareness:** The offer still leans in Alice's favor, reflecting the faster rate at which the money loses value for her. This is crucial to getting a deal that's beneficial in the long run.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the time pressure without sounding overly aggressive. This aims to nudge Bob towards accepting a deal before the money is worth significantly less for both of them. 

**Overall Strategy:** This round is about finding a balance between firmness and a willingness to compromise.  Alice needs to convince Bob that accepting a slightly less favorable deal now is better than risking a worse outcome in future rounds."
