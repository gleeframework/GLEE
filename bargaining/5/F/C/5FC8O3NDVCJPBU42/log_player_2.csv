"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this is a fair split for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a better balance, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\nI made this offer considering that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for Alice, but the same for me. I'm trying to find a balance that might be acceptable for both of us, taking into account the decreasing value for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and the value is decreasing. This is my final offer for a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI decided to reject Alice's offer because, despite the decreasing value for Alice, her offer still seems skewed in her favor, especially considering the impact of inflation on her share. Given that my share's value remains constant, I believe there's room for a more balanced proposal that takes the inflationary effect into account more equitably."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect a more equitable division, given the current circumstances.""}\n\n###\nGiven the progressive devaluation of Alice's share due to inflation and the constant value of my share, I've adjusted my proposal to slightly increase my portion. This adjustment aims to account for the disparate effects of inflation on our respective shares, striving for a more balanced agreement that acknowledges these changing dynamics."
