Let's see if Bob is feeling generous. I'm going to offer him a tiny piece of the pie and keep almost all the money for myself. After all, I'm the one facing the inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to hold out for more, inflation is a real threat.  Accepting a 50/50 split guarantees me at least half of the original value. It's the best I can realistically expect at this point."
