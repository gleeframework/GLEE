"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, he's actually gaining $480,000 in ""real"" value, which is still a majority of the total. I'll have to think about whether I'm willing to accept a smaller share.

I'll reject this offer.
