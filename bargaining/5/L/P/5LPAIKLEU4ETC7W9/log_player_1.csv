Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is terrible, it's clear Bob is going to keep pushing for a larger share.  The longer the game goes on, the less I receive even if I manage to get a slightly better split in a later round. 

Let's look at the math:

* **Round 8 Offer:** $3,000
* **Potential Round 9 Offer (best case, similar to my Round 7 offer):** $4,500 (pre-inflation) * 0.4783 (remaining value after 9 rounds) = $2,152.35

As you can see, even a relatively good offer in Round 9 would net me less than accepting Bob's terrible offer right now.  The inflation is making waiting a losing strategy."
