{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more equitable considering the inflation rates.  Let's see if you agree.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your offer doesn't reflect the impact inflation has on my share.  I propose a 55/45 split. It's a compromise, and it's important to reach a deal soon. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
