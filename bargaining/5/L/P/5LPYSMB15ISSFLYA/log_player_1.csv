"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'll give you a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60-40. This is a more even split for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting a larger share now against the potential for a better offer in future rounds. Given that the money is worth less each round, it's likely that future offers will be smaller.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a big share, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still holding onto a significant portion for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer or not!"
