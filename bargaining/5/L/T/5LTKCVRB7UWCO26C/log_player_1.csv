Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5500

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the best strategy at this point:

* **Diminishing Returns for Bob:** The inflation is significantly impacting Bob's potential gains. He's likely to become more agreeable as time passes. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means risking an even lower offer from Bob in subsequent rounds, especially as his potential gains continue to decrease. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:** Accepting a 45/55 split isn't perfect, but it's better than risking a worse outcome by continuing to play. 

It's a judgment call, but in negotiation scenarios with diminishing returns, it's often better to secure a reasonable gain rather than hold out for an ideal outcome that becomes increasingly unlikely."
