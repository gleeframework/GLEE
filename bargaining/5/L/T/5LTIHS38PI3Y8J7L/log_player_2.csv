"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob.  It's a good deal for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's a terrible deal for me! I'm not going to accept that."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 999999,
""alice_gain"": 1,
""message"": ""This is a fair split, considering your money depreciates faster than mine. Accept it before it's too late!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I need something more reasonable than your last offer.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I still think I should get more, Alice is being more reasonable this time. This is a much better deal than before, and I'm willing to take it."
