I propose Alice gets $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000.  This is a fairly aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob will accept it in the first round. I figure he'll likely want to counter-propose in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being very greedy!  I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round.  I'm willing to accept a slightly less favorable deal than my original offer, but I won't accept this lopsided division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer slightly, to 8000 for Alice and 2000 for Bob.  It's a compromise from my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to get a fair deal.  With the inflation, this is effectively a better deal for Bob than his last offer, so I'm hoping he'll be more reasonable this time."
