"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount. I'm taking the remaining 90%. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a better deal for both of us. Let's start with a fairer split this time. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm getting a significantly smaller share of the money, and I think I can do better. I'll make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was heavily skewed towards him, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. This is a fair split.""
}

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount. I'm taking the remaining 70%. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a more reasonable offer and accept it."
