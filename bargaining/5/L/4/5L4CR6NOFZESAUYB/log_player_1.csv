Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement. Since the inflation rate is much higher for Bob, I'm aiming to get a good portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable than my initial one. Even though the money I gain is worth 5% less, it's still not worth accepting such a disproportionate split. I'll push for a more balanced deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the ongoing inflation, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. This offer is more balanced than Bob's, and it's still favorable to me given the inflation rate. Hopefully, Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is more balanced than his previous one, it's still not acceptable. The inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for him, and it seems he's willing to take a greater loss than I am. I'll continue to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

It seems like we're both becoming more willing to compromise.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is the fairest option given the inflation rates.  This offer ensures we both get something, and it's the most sensible way to prevent further losses due to inflation."
