"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This is a generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, but it's worth less in real terms than my initial offer. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation taking a bigger bite, I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my proposal for round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's still a relatively reasonable split considering the decreasing value of money. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Bob's offer is still a 75-25 split, but it's worth significantly less than my initial offer. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
