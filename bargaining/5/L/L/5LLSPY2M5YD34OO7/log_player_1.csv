"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial 100$, which is 70 dollars, and leaving 30 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the next round will be worth less to me. Let's reach an agreement and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the current value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better than a 45% share. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60 is a more reasonable share for me, considering the decreasing value of money.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining 100$, which is 60 dollars, and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
