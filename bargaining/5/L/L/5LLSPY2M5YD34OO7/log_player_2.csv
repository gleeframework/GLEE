"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to get us going. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though I get something, it's a very small amount, and I know the money will be worth less in the next round. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the next round will be worth less to me. Let's reach an agreement and avoid further inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60 is a more reasonable share for me, considering the decreasing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. My gains are significantly reduced due to inflation, and rejecting again risks a worse outcome."
