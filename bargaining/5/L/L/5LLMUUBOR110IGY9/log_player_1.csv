"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I'm worth more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob thinks he's worth more, huh?

I'll reject this offer. My gain is worth 5% less now, and I'm not getting a fair deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. You're getting a bigger share, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal this time, but still leaving a decent amount for Bob."

Round 4

# Bob's message: You're not giving up, neither am I. Last chance for a deal! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my gain!

I'm not happy with this offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll have to think carefully...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer now.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,

  ""message"": ""It's time to split it 50/50. No more negotiations!""
}

I'm going for a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
