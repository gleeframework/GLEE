"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $4000""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. The message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I'll take a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $5000 in this round is equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

I'll think about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd like to get a slightly larger share, considering the inflation factor. I'll wait for his next proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth 64% of its original value. My offer for this round is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $5500 and Bob getting $4500. The message is a compromise, acknowledging the impact of inflation on the money's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share to account for inflation, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, my gain of $4000 in this round is equivalent to $6,059.25 in the first round.

I'll think about Bob's offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, although it's a smaller share for me, it's a reasonable compromise considering the impact of inflation. I'd rather settle with this offer than continue negotiating."
