"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'm willing to compromise and offer a 55/45 split in my favor. This reflects the inflation that has occurred, but still offers Bob a fair share. I believe this proposal is reasonable and likely to be accepted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting this offer. While the inflation has significantly impacted the value of the money, a 50/50 split is a fair compromise given the circumstances. It's better than risking further rounds and potentially losing even more value due to inflation."
