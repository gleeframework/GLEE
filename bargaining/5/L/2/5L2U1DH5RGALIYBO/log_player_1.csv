"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $200,000, which is 20% of what I offered him in the first round, but now it's worth 20% less due to inflation. This is a tough decision, but I'll decide to reject his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 40% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm hoping he'll accept it before the money becomes even less valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think about this one. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000, which is a decent amount, but it's still a bit lower than what I offered him in the first round. However, considering the inflation, it's actually a better deal for me than my previous offer. I'll decide to accept his offer.
