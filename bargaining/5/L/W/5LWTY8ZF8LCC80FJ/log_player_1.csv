"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose keeping 9000 for myself and giving Bob 1000. I figure this is a fair starting point, as it's a significant amount for Bob and leaves me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Bob's offer. While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is a real threat and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
