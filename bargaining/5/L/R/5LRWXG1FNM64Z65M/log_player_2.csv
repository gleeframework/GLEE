Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle at 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's a good compromise, and with inflation, I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round. Let's do it!"
