"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant majority of the money while still offering Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm offering Bob 190,000 dollars, which is slightly more than he received in the previous round, despite the inflation. This is a good deal for me as the money is worth less to Bob than it is to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money,  the inflation is hitting Bob harder than me. Accepting his offer is the best strategy at this point."
