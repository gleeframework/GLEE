I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  This is a good starting point, as it reflects the value disparity we'll see in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly to $950,000, leaving Bob with $50,000.  This is still a favorable split for me given the inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'd like, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 975000, ""bob_gain"": 25000}
```

I'm going to push for a slightly higher share, offering Bob $25,000.  This is a risky move, but I'm confident I can win given the inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is becoming increasingly attractive due to inflation. It's unlikely I can secure a better deal in the next round."
