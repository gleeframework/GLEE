"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer is designed to be a bit cheeky, but I think it's a good starting point.  Bob is highly unlikely to accept this offer, but it gives me the chance to be the proposer in the next round.  I'll be watching how Bob reacts to see if he is more interested in a fairer split or if he's willing to play a long game to try and get more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This offer is equally as unreasonable as my first offer, and I don't see why I would accept a 1$ gain when the value of the money for Bob is shrinking with each round. We're both being stubborn so far, which indicates the possibility of a long game. I will counter his offer with a fairer one in the next round, but it's clear neither of us are willing to accept a grossly unfair split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split in this round. This is a fair offer, and I believe it is a good starting point for negotiation.  I think Bob may be more willing to accept this offer as the value of the money he receives continues to decrease with each passing round.  If he rejects, I am prepared to continue the game until we can reach a mutually agreeable outcome."
