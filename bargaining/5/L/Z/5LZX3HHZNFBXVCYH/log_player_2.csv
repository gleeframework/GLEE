"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the $4000, I know that in the next round, I'll be making the offer. With inflation, my $4000 will be worth less than Alice's $6000, so it's worth waiting for my turn."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair deal, considering the inflation. We both get a good share, and it's my turn to propose!""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is the best you'll get considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, the inflation is working against me. This offer is better than what I'd get in the next round, and it's worth taking."
