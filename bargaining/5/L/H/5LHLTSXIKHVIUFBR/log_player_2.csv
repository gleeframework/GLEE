# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting slightly better, time is running out **for Bob**.  He needs to signal he's willing to accept something more reasonable, but Alice is still getting the vastly better end of the deal.  He needs to up the pressure."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob... 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  The pressure has become too great. Alice is clearly willing to play hardball and run the clock. At this point, accepting a less-than-ideal deal is better than risking getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds. Bob's bargaining power is severely diminished by the relentless inflation."
