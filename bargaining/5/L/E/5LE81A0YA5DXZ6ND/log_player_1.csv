"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money to start with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's being a tough negotiator!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer...

After considering the inflation effect, I realize that Bob's gain of $90 in the second round is equivalent to $81 in the first round. That's a pretty big chunk of money!

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less in the second round and another 10% less in the third round).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is getting out of control!

Let me calculate the actual values of Bob's offer in the first round...

Bob's gain of $85 in the fourth round is equivalent to $85 / (1 - 0.271) = $85 / 0.729 â‰ˆ $116.67 in the first round.

That's a huge amount of money!

Considering my gain of $60 in the first round, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the fact that the money is worth 37.1% less than in the first round (10% less in the second round, 10% less in the third round, and 17.1% less in the fourth round).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
