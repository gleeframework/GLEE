"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a significant advantage for me, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. Even though the money I gain is worth 5% less, it's still significantly better for me to wait and propose my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm going to propose a slightly less favorable split for me this time, 85/15, but still with a substantial majority. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in getting a guaranteed amount of money, even if it's smaller than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has hit me hard, and this offer is much lower than what I initially wanted, I'm going to accept it.  Bob's offers are getting increasingly unfavorable, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round.  This is the best I can do at this point."
