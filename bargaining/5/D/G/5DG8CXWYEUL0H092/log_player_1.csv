"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I'll get 60% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is 50/50, I'll have to think carefully.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings. Considering the money I gain is worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll have to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a 45/55 split, which is a relatively small difference from the original 50/50.
