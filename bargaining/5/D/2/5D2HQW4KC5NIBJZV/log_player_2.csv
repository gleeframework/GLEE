Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Take it or leave it - we both lose if we keep wasting time. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is right, this is getting ridiculous. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, the value of the money is decreasing so rapidly that waiting any longer will result in a significantly smaller gain, even if I could secure a slightly better split in later rounds."
