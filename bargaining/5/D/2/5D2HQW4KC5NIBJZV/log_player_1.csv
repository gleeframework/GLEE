# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is better for Bob and worse for me than the initial offer, even considering inflation. I'll try to steer him closer to a more equitable split.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time and the money is losing value quickly.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is squeezing me, and the inflation is working against me much faster than him.  He's betting I'll panic.  However, getting less than half is a bad deal even considering the circumstances. I have to try to push him further.
