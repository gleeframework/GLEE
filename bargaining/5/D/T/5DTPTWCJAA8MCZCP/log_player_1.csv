"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This is a pretty standard starting offer. I'm taking a large portion, but leaving a decent amount for Bob. I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal that's heavily in my favor, or if he's going to try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal. I'm losing 600,000, and while the inflation is a factor, I'm confident that I can still get a better deal by rejecting and proposing my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a compromise. I've reduced my share to 600,000, which is still a significant amount, but I'm giving Bob a larger share than his previous proposal. I believe this offer is fair, considering the inflation, and I'm hopeful that Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, I've been offered 450,000, which is more than half of the initial amount.  It's a significant decrease from my previous offer, but I'm not sure I can get a better deal if I reject. Accepting this offer ensures I'm walking away with something substantial."
