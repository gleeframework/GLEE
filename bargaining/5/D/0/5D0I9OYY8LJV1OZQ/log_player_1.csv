"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'd like to accept Bob's proposal:
