"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40% upfront. A good deal considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Let's see how this plays out. While 40$ is a decent chunk, Alice is banking on Bob being afraid of losing money to inflation. Bob's money depreciates slower, so he can afford to gamble on a later round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. The longer this takes, the less valuable your share becomes. I'll take the 60%.""
}
```

This offer is a power move by Bob. He's calling out the inflation dynamic and putting the pressure back on Alice. It will be interesting to see if she folds under pressure or decides to gamble further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. 55-45 seems fair considering the time crunch. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is getting desperate, but she's still overestimating the impact of inflation on Bob's side. He can afford to push a little further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 65,
""alice_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. My offer stands. 65% or we both lose out.""
}
```

Bob is turning up the heat! He's holding firm on his 65% demand and emphasizing the shrinking pot.  This puts Alice in a very tough spot. Will she accept a smaller share than before or risk everything on one last gamble?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's split it 50/50 and get this over with. It's the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good time for Bob to accept. While he could potentially squeeze out a bit more, Alice is unlikely to offer more than 50/50 at this point.  Accepting now guarantees Bob a respectable share without risking the entire pot due to further inflation on Alice's side."
