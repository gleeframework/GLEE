{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too much in your favor.  I propose a 60/40 split for me this time.  Considering the inflation, I think this is fair.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45 this time, with me getting the larger share.  It's still a good deal considering the inflation, and I think it shows good faith in finding a solution. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
