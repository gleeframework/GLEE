"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can do better than this?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to set the tone for the game and make him think twice about accepting or rejecting my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but I think this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's offer is still a 40:60 split, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a bigger bite, Bob. You can't keep playing it safe!""
}
```

I'm pushing for a more favorable split, hoping to take advantage of Bob's initial offer and get a better deal before the money loses more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. With the money worth 48.8% less than the initial $10,000, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

A 50:50 split is a more even split than my previous offers, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Considering the inflation, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential gains I might get in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping that the next round will bring a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my next offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob. You're not getting any younger, and neither is my patience!""
}
```

I'm pushing for an even more favorable split, hoping to take advantage of Bob's willingness to meet me halfway in the previous round. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, but I'm willing to try."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet. Let's try to find a middle ground 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gains now. With the money worth 67.23% less than the initial $10,000, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

A 40:60 split is a more favorable split for Bob, but I'm not sure if I can do better at this point. Considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential gains I might get in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, hoping that I've made the best decision given the circumstances."
