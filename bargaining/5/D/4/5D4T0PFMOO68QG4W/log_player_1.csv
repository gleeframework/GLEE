"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be reasonable"". This is a fairly generous offer, considering I'm giving Bob 40% of the total amount. The message is meant to convey a sense of fairness and encourage Bob to accept the offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, given the inflation. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can get a better deal than 45% of the total amount. Bob's message tries to emphasize the fairness of the offer, but I'm not convinced. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a more favorable split. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal for both""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 57-43 split in my favor. Given the inflation, the money is worth less for both of us, but I believe this offer is still reasonable. My message emphasizes that this deal is good for both of us, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer and ending the game. Let's see how Bob responds!"
