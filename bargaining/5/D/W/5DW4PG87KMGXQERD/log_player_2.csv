"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent amount, I want to see if I can get a better deal. There's a lot of money at stake and 12 rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 
``` 
I'm going to offer Alice a slightly smaller share, hoping to secure a deal and avoid the risk of further inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is still less than my initial offer, the inflation is starting to bite. It's better to accept this offer and secure a decent amount than risk getting nothing."
