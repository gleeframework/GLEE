"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a reasonable starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This offer is more equitable, and gives us a chance to start negotiations with a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob thinks this is a fairer offer. However, I'm not convinced yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the total amount is now $9,000. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn, Bob.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a slight adjustment from my initial offer. Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
