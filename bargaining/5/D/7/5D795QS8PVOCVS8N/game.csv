6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6,000, you get $4,000. This way we both benefit from splitting the money early.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"I think it's more fair if we split the money closer to 70/30.  I'm willing to give you a little more than you offered, but I need a larger share to make it worth my while.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the inflation working against you. I'm willing to go up slightly to $6,500 for me, leaving you with $3,500.  Let's settle this before the value decreases further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we split it 60/40? This gives you a bigger share than your previous offer, and it's a fairer compromise considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking and the value is slipping away with each round.  I'm increasing my offer to $7,000 for me and $3,000 for you. This is a very generous offer considering the lost value for you. Let's be realistic and close this deal.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable.  We're both losing value with each round. Let's split the money evenly 50/50 and call it a day. It's the fairest solution considering the current inflation.",Bob,6,
