"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60-40, I'll meet you in the middle with 70-30. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new offer, I'm now considering a 30% gain, which is less than what I initially proposed. However, I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds and potential future inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
