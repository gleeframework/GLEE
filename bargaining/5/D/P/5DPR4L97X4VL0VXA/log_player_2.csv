Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to make it worth my while. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is inching closer to a more even split, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but holding out a bit longer could force her to offer a much better deal."
