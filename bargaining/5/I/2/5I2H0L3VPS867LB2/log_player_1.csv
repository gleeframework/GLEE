"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  I want to avoid the risk of inflation eating away at my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, I'm not willing to risk further rounds of inflation and potentially losing out on a decent amount. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least $50."
