Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I believe this is a fair starting point.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to eat into the value of the money. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent amount, and it's better than risking getting less in the next round."
