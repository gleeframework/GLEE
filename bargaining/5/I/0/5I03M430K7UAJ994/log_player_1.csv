"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll need a larger share to feel comfortable.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get desperate, but I think this is a reasonable split 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now. I'll accept this offer.
