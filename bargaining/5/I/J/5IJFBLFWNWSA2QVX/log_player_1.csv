Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start with a very high offer for myself, hoping Bob will be tempted to take it even though it's minimal for him.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split, and while I could potentially get more by rejecting, there's no guarantee Bob would offer me more in the next round. Plus, the risk of inflation hurting my gains is too high."
