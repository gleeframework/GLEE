"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit unfair to me. Let's be reasonable, this is a good deal for both of us considering the decreasing value.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:**  Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. Rejecting it signals that I won't accept an unfair deal.
* **My offer:** I'm aiming for a slightly advantageous split (5250/4750) that still gives Alice a reasonable amount.  
* **Considering inflation:** I need to secure a decent portion of the money quickly, as it loses value with each round.  Alice's share loses value faster, so she has a stronger incentive to accept a somewhat even split now.
* **Message:** My message aims to be firm but not overly aggressive. I want to nudge Alice towards a more equitable agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose money with each round, so it makes sense to find a fair solution sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Even split:** Alice is now offering an even 50/50 split. 
* **Inflation impact:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both of us. Accepting a fair deal now is better than risking a worse outcome later. 
* **Time pressure:** While I could try to negotiate for a slightly larger share, there's no guarantee Alice would accept. The longer the game goes on, the less the money will be worth."
