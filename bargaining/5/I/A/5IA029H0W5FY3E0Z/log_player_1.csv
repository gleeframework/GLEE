"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with the message ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!"""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You offered 60/40, I'll try to get a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $2,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $8,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept this offer.
