"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

After the inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision. Since Bob's offer is the same as mine in the first round, I'll reject it. I'm not going to accept an offer that's essentially the same as the one I made initially.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The game continues!

Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll give Bob a slightly smaller share to account for the decreased value of money.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the significant inflation, I need to adjust my thinking. Bob's offer is actually a better deal for me now, given the decreased value of money. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
