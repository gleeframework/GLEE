Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

This is a tough one, but accepting is the safer play here.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We're at round 4 of 12. The longer this goes, the worse it gets for Bob, but it also increases the risk of walking away with nothing if we don't reach an agreement.
* **Bob is Feeling the Pressure:** Bob is making concessions, moving closer to a more even split. He's clearly feeling the impact of the inflation.
* **Reasonable Gain:** While not ideal, getting $5100 is still better than many potential outcomes if we continue haggling and fail to reach an agreement in later rounds.

It's a gamble either way, but accepting now secures a reasonable gain with less risk than continuing."
