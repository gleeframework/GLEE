I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I want to see if Bob will accept it right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt. It's better to take 60 now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
