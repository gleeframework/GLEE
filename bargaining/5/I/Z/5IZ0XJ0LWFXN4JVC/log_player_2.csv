I'm going to stick with a 85/15 split, but this time I'll make sure Alice gets the smaller share. I'm hoping she sees that we need to come to an agreement soon or we'll both lose a lot more."

It's time to turn the tables. I'll offer Alice a 20% share, but I'm going to stick to my guns on this 80/20 split.  I'm hoping she sees that rejecting this offer will lead to a lot more losses for her in the future.  We need to come to an agreement soon!"

I'm not giving in to Alice's demands.  She's being stubborn, and I'm not going to reward that.  I'll make another counter-offer in the next round."

We're running out of time!  I'm going to stick to a 70/30 split, but I'm willing to give Alice a slightly bigger share to try and get this deal done.  It's time to compromise before we both lose everything."

Alice's offer is still not fair.  We're both losing so much money due to inflation, but she's not budging.  I'm not going to give in to her demands, but I also need to think strategically about the next round.  If we can't come to a deal, we'll both lose everything!"

This is my final offer. I'm willing to concede to Alice's demand for a 35% share, but I'm not going to go any lower. If she rejects this, we both get nothing. It's time to be realistic and end this game before we both lose everything."
