# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the offer is:

```
{

  ""message"": ""That's still too skewed towards you. I'd like to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I deserve a larger share, considering the reduced value of the money for me. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a better deal."
