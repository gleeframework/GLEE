# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Taking into account the inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount. However, Alice's offer is still quite close to the previous offers, so I'll reject it.
