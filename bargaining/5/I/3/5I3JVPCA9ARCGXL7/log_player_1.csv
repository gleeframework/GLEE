Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your cut decreases significantly with each round Alice, let's settle this now. I'm being generous. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is nominally equal, I'm losing value rapidly due to inflation.  I need to incentivize him to accept a deal where I get a larger share upfront."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's be realistic. I need a bit more to offset the inflation, but this offer still gets you a good chunk.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the value is diminishing fast for you. This is my final offer before I have to start considering my own gains more seriously. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This is a tough one, but I need to hold out a little longer. Bob knows my position is getting worse, but he's still offering less than what I proposed in round 5. I need to show him I'm serious about getting a larger share."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer or I'm taking the majority from here on out. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This is a painful decision, but I need to accept.  Bob is clearly willing to let the game go to the end now where we both get nothing.  I am losing too much value to inflation to continue."
