Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split it 6:4 in my favor. This way we both get a good amount, and we can avoid further rounds and the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
