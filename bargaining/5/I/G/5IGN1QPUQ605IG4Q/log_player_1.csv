"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm making a straightforward offer to split the $10,000 equally between us. What's Bob's response?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective values are:

* My gain: $4000 (10% less than $5000)
* Bob's gain: $5700 (5% less than $6000)

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
