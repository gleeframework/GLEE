"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, I'll give you a tiny share""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a very small amount, but still a fair share, and I'll get the majority of the money to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the money will lose value with every round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather get a higher share now to compensate for the decreasing value of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the previous round), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need a bigger share for myself to keep up with inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a compromise,  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less now, I'm getting even more desperate to get a bigger share. However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, since it's still a relatively small difference. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to get as much as I can while there's still time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, I need a bigger share to keep up with the inflation, I'm willing to take a risk""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We need to come to an agreement soon, inflation is hitting us both hard. I'm offering a larger share, but I'm running out of patience. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting worried that we're running out of time, but I still don't want to give up too much. However, considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll accept this offer to avoid risking getting nothing.
