"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $6000 while Bob takes $4000, with a message suggesting a fair division. The ball is now in Bob's court to accept or reject this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, Bob's gain is actually worth less than the face value. Since my gain doesn't decrease with rounds, I have an advantage in waiting for a potentially better offer or making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I propose to take $5500 while Bob takes $4500. Given that Bob's gain decreases by 5% each round due to inflation, and we are now in the third round, this offer is more generous than it seems at first glance. The message aims to remind Bob of the impact of inflation on his gains and the fairness of the offer considering this factor."
