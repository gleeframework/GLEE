"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money loses value for me over time, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and accept it, or at least make a counteroffer that we can work with. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is still a good deal, but now it's my turn to propose. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept Bob's offer of a 40-60 split in his favor. Considering the inflation, the $4000 I would get is now worth less than it was in the first round. I want to try to get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Hopefully, Bob will be willing to compromise! 

### Alice's next offer:
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our two previous offers""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our two previous offers""}\n\n###\n\nI'll stick with the offer I previously decided on. Given the impact of inflation, I'm hoping Bob will see the value in meeting me halfway between our last two proposals. This way, we can both walk away with a decent amount, considering the decreasing value of the money for me. Fingers crossed he'll accept this time!"
