Let's see what I can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a gamble and offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less to Alice with each round, I'm hoping she'll accept before the value drops too much for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a 50/50 split, which is fair. While the money is worth less to me now, it's still a significant amount. I'd rather take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
