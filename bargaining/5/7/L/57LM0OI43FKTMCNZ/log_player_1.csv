Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a somewhat aggressive offer, as I want to maximize my share early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him than mine was, and it's still early in the game. There's still time for me to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is really hitting hard now.  Bob's offer is still much better than mine, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  Time to accept and get something!"
