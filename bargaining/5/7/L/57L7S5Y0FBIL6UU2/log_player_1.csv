"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000 dollars, which is a relatively generous starting point, considering the inflation factor that will affect his share more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50/50 is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in the current value.

In this round, the total amount is worth 95% of the original $10,000, so it's $9,500. My gain would be $4,750 (5000 / 0.95) and Bob's gain would be $5,263.16 (5000 / 0.95).

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather aim for a higher amount, considering the inflation factor.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation""
}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, but still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the current values:

The total amount is worth 85.71% of the original $10,000, so it's $8,571. The inflation factor for me is 0.859, and for Bob is 0.727.

My gain would be $3,882.15 (4500 / 0.859) and Bob's gain would be $4,005.75 (5500 / 0.727).

I'll accept this offer since it's a relatively good deal considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation.
