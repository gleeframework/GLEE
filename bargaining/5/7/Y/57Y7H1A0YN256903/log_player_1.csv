"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I'm going to start by offering Bob a very small amount. It's likely he'll reject it, but I'll get to propose again in the next round.  This strategy lets me see how much Bob is willing to settle for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer.  It's better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds!"
