"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to start with a fair offer, as I believe cooperation is key to a successful outcome.  I'll take 90% and leave 10% for Bob.  Let's see if he's willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a clear attempt to exploit the inflation factor. While I initially aimed for a fair division, I won't be taken advantage of. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round where I can propose a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This time I'm proposing an 80/20 split. Although inflation is impacting my gains, I'm still willing to negotiate. I believe this offer reflects a more balanced compromise while still accounting for the ongoing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even more unfair this round. He's taking advantage of inflation to secure a huge share. I'm determined to hold my ground and see this through to the end.  I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

Even though the inflation is affecting my gains significantly, I'm still willing to compromise. This 60/40 split demonstrates my willingness to find a solution, but also my determination to receive a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the increasing pressure of inflation, I refuse to be bullied into accepting such a lopsided deal. Bob's proposal is simply too unfair.  I'll continue to fight for a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I've reached my limit. Inflation has drastically reduced the value of my share, and Bob's unwillingness to negotiate fairly has left me with no other option. This 50/50 split is the fairest outcome at this point, and I'm hoping Bob finally recognizes the need for compromise."
