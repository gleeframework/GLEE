"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 600,000$ and Bob gets 400,000$. This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. The message is a friendly reminder that we can end the game quickly if Bob accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair, and it gives us both a good amount. Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 10% less, so the new total is $900,000.

I'm not sure I agree with Bob's proposal. I was hoping for a better split, and now that the money is worth less, I'm not sure I want to give up as much as 550,000$. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. It's a fair and equal split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and equal division of the money."
