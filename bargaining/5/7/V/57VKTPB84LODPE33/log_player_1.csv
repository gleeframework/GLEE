"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```
I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and simple."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain staying the same value and Bob's money decreasing in value, I'll try to maximize my share. I'll reject this offer and proceed to Round 3.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, I'll try to take advantage of the inflation that's affecting Bob's money. Here's my new proposal:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```
I'm offering a slightly skewed split, giving me a bit more than Bob, but still leaving him with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll on Bob's offer. With my share staying the same value and Bob's share decreasing in value, I'll accept this offer.
