"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's get started!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need for complications. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I don't want to give up too much to Bob, but splitting it evenly is a decent offer. I'll accept this offer for now.
