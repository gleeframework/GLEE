"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a nice starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not content with a mere 100,000. I'll see what Alice has to offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be a little more reasonable this time. 60/40 seems like a good starting point. We both get a significant amount, and it's a fairer split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. 55/45 feels like a fairer split considering the inflation. Let's end this game with a deal. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is biting into the value of the money. Accepting 450,000 is better than risking getting less in the next round."
