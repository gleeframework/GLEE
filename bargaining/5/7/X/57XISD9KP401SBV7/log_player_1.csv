"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest. It's a fair share, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly so we can end the game before the money loses too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve a bit more for my part in this negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than before, so I need to be careful with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer. I think I can do better than 600,000. I'll wait for the next round and see if I can get a better deal. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a bigger share to make this worth my while.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 700,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the current value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain. I need to think carefully about this offer.

With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, 450,000 is actually a relatively decent offer, considering the current value of the money.

I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking getting nothing.
