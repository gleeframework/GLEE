"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not afraid to take a risk. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. Will you take it? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting the offer. Even with the inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic drop in my share. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly.  I'm willing to compromise after your last offer.  50/50 seems fair, especially considering the inflation we're facing.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're willing to compromise, but I'm not. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still the one taking the risk. Will you take it? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While the inflation is hitting hard, this offer is the best I can realistically expect at this point. Accepting will at least give me a decent portion of the money."
