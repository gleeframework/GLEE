Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. This way, I get the most money and avoid any inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I won't let him get away with it. I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer to Bob, but I'm still giving him a substantial amount. This is to show him that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also value my own share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the inflation. I won't accept this offer. It's getting risky, but I'll counter with a more balanced offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This is a more even split, taking into account the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a decent amount now, rather than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing in the end."
