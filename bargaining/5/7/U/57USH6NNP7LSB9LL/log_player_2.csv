Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $2500. I believe this is fair considering the potential inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While the offer is tempting,  I'm hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fairer division, considering the potential for inflation. It allows for a more balanced outcome for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose an equal division of the money, each receiving $5000. This ensures fairness and stability for both parties. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is fair and considering the inflation, I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Let's call it a day!"
