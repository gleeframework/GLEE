"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This way we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While a 50/50 split seems fair, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll try to negotiate a larger share for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fair split, considering the risk of getting nothing if we can't agree. Let's be practical!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal division to ensure fairness and mutual benefit. This should help us avoid unnecessary risks. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, and with the risk of getting nothing at all looming, it's the best option."
