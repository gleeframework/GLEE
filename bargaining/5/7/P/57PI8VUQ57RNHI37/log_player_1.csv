"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share since I'm making the proposal this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's proposal is fair, considering I made a reasonable offer in the first round and he rejected it. Now he's trying to take advantage of the fact that he's making the proposal this round.

I'll reject his offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be worth even less than in the previous round. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This split should be more acceptable.""
}
```"
