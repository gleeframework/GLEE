"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a larger share, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's see if we can get a better deal.  I'm not sure I like her starting point.  Let's see what happens when I make the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's get this done!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's getting risky to keep rejecting offers, and a 50/50 split is fair. Let's take it."
