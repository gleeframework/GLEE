"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's early in the game, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm not sure how Alice is handling inflation, so I want to see if I can get a slightly larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point. It accounts for my time and effort in making the first offer.  Let's see if we can work something out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try again! 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice is being more flexible, and I'm starting to feel the effects of inflation.  Accepting this offer is a good way to ensure I get something, and it's only a small decrease from my initial offer."
