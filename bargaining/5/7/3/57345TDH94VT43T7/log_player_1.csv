"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a ""fair share"" to see if Bob will accept it and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, Alice. This way we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 70$ in this round is equivalent to 56$ in the first round, which is a decent share.

I accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
