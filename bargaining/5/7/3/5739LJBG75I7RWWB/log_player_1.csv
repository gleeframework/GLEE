"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this division is fair and reasonable, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can conclude the game quickly, minimizing the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something. Consider that the value decreases rapidly with each round. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money decreases with each round, accepting $30 (which is now worth 20% less than in the first round) seems unfair given that Bob is taking a significantly larger share. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round, despite the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle before it's too late""}\n\nI've decided to make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, in the hopes that he'll accept before the value of the money decreases further. By offering him $45 and taking $55 for myself, I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and conclude the game. My message to Bob emphasizes the urgency of the situation, given the rapid decrease in value."
