"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less in the second round, I'd like to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept it!"
