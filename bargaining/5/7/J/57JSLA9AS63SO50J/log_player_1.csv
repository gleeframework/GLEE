Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a fairer split. Let's try $55 for me and $45 for you.  This way, we both get a good amount, and we avoid the harsh effects of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
