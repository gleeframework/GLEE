"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80 and you get 20. Let's see if we can improve from here!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the value of money decreases more for Alice with each round. Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see what Bob is doing there. He's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I think I can do better than that. The value of money is decreasing faster for me, so I'd like to propose a counteroffer.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less for me now, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""Considering the value of money is decreasing faster for me, I'm willing to accept a smaller share. Let's see if you'll take it!""
}
```"
