"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm starting low. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $200,000 is now worth $190,000, and Bob's gain of $800,000 is now worth $640,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'm willing to meet in the middle. I'll accept Bob's offer.
