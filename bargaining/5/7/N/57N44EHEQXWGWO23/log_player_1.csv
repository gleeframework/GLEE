"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, Bob, but let me take a bit more since the value decreases for me over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be fair and split it evenly.  The decreasing value makes this a losing proposition over time for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
