Let's see what a counteroffer gets me!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split in my favor is more fair, considering I'm the one making the proposal this round. Let's see if you agree!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52-48 is a more reasonable split. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although I'm losing a bit more due to inflation, it's better to secure a gain than to risk getting nothing in the next round."
