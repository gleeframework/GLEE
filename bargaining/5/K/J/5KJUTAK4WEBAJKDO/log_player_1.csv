"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start by being generous, but keeping the majority of the money for myself. Since I'm the one making the proposal, I want to secure a good portion, but I also want to incentivize Bob to accept and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the inflation means I get 10% less than Bob, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  If I reject, I risk further inflation and a potential even worse offer in the next round."
