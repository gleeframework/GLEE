"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in the next rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, so he might think it's a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 dollars is actually worth 40 dollars in real terms.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of 50 dollars is actually worth 40 dollars in real terms. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 45 dollars is actually worth 23.4 dollars in real terms. I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation.

However, Bob's offer seems like a decent compromise, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll consider it.
