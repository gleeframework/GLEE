"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20%""
}
```

Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my initial reaction is that Bob's offer is a bit stingy. However, I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll think of a counteroffer for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 60/40 split""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll think of a new proposal for Round 5."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less now, I'll try to get a better deal.

Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, my proposal for Round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's call it a draw, 50/50 split""
}
```

I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob in the middle. Your turn, Bob!"
