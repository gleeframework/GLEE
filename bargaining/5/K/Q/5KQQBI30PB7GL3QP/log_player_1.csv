"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, I'm willing to share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a friendly message to try to convince him to accept. Let me know what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'm the one proposing this time. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Come on, let's meet in the middle!""
}

I'm making a slightly more generous offer this time, while still trying to get the better end of the deal. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise. Let's see what he thinks!"
