"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, I'll give you a fair deal!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, let's call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the amount I'll get in the current round ($5000) as equivalent to $6000 in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer because I can get a better deal than a 50-50 split, which is equivalent to a 60-40 split in the first round. I'll wait for a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's finalize this!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the amount I'll get in the current round ($5200) as equivalent to $6000 in the first round.

I'll accept Bob's offer because it's a better deal than my previous offer, and it's a good opportunity to finalize the deal.
