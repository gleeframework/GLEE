"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take $90 and leave $10 for Bob. This gives me a good starting point and leaves Bob with something, hopefully encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation. Accepting it guarantees me a substantial sum, and I risk getting nothing if I reject it."
