Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle this round, Alice.  We can negotiate further if you'd prefer, but I think a fair split is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
