"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a small share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20$ and keeping 80$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a fair deal. I'll accept it.
