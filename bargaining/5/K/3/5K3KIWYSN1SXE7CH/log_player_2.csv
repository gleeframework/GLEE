"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. 58-42 is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the money is losing value. I'm proposing 52-48 as a fair compromise to ensure we both benefit.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not convinced by your offers. Inflation is a problem, but I believe 57-43 is the minimum I can accept. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming significant. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of 43% ensures Bob gets something rather than risking getting nothing if the negotiations continue to fail.
