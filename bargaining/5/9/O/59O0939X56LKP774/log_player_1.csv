"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the one making the proposal. I hope Bob will accept this offer, as it will be to his advantage to avoid the potential for inflation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something while avoiding further inflation."
