I'm taking a risk by offering Bob such a small amount.  But I want to see if he's willing to accept a small share right away, or if he'll gamble on getting more later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than the one I made in the previous round. However, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, but I'm still aiming for a majority share.  I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise, I can secure a deal that is more favorable for me than Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still better than the last one I made.  However, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for an even split this round.  The inflation is starting to hurt, and I think Bob is realizing that he might not get such a large share if we keep going.  I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal before the inflation hits us too hard."
