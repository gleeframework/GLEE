950000.0,50000.0,"Let's start with a simple offer, Bob. I get $950,000, and you get $50,000. It's a good deal for you to get something rather than nothing if we run out of rounds.",Alice,1,

100000.0,900000.0,"I think we can do better than that, Alice.  I'll take $900,000, and you can have $100,000.  It's a fair starting point for negotiation.",Bob,2,

700000.0,300000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be more realistic. I'm proposing $700,000 for me and $300,000 for you.  This split acknowledges that I made the first move, but still leaves you with a significant sum.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money 80/20, with me taking $800,000 and you taking $200,000.  This is a fair deal that allows us both to get a good portion of the money.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, we're getting closer, but I need a bit more. How about a 60/40 split? I get $600,000, and you get $400,000.  It's a strong offer considering we're already halfway through the rounds.",Alice,5,
