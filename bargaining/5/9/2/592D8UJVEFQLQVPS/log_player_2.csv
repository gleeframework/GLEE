Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer before inflation eats away even more of your potential share.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses.  Alice is clearly willing to run the clock down, and the longer this goes on, the less I'll get. Accepting a 30/70 split is far from ideal, but it's better than risking even further losses to inflation."
