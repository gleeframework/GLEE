Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""This is a fair split, Alice. Let's call it a day and be done with this.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  We both lose money with each round. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting Alice's offer. While I'd prefer more, the inflation is making the money less valuable with each round, and it's not worth risking getting nothing at all."
