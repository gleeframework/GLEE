"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate later.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively even split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now I'll counter. Will you meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd like to get a better deal. Meeting him in the middle would leave me with a smaller share than I initially proposed, and I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was 70-30 in his favor, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You said I started high, but I think I'm being reasonable now. Meet me here or I'll walk away.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, you are being reasonable now. But I think I can do better than that. Will you meet me at 500k? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob! Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now, and I'd like to get a better deal.

I'll consider Bob's offer, but I'm not sure if I want to meet him at 50-50. I think I can do better than that.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the continued inflation and trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to meet you at 50-50. I think I deserve a bit more, considering the original proposal and the negotiations so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up more than 52% of the original amount. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of the deal. Considering the inflation, my gain is worth significantly less than it was initially, and I don't want to leave the table with a smaller share.

I'll accept this offer, as it's the best I can get at this point.
