"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to keep him motivated to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 6000 is actually worth 6000 * 0.9 = 5400 in the previous round's value. So, I'm actually losing 400 in value compared to the initial offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to be more aggressive in my next offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get an even bigger share of the money, but still leave Bob with a small amount to keep him interested in negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5500 is actually worth 5500 * 0.727 = 3995 in the first round's value. I'm actually getting a better deal than my initial offer, and it's a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
