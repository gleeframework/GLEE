Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob. Since the money is losing value, I want to secure a large portion for myself early on, while still leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Since I lose 10% on my potential gains and Bob loses 20%, it's unlikely he'll offer me a better deal in the next round."
