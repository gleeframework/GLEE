Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing, meet me halfway 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing.  It's risky, but holding out for a slightly better deal might be worth it in the next couple of rounds. If Alice doesn't budge soon, I'll need to reconsider."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. An even split is the only logical solution. Let's end this before we both lose out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is unlikely to accept anything less than 5000 at this point, and with the value of the money decreasing each round, holding out for a better deal is becoming increasingly risky. A 50/50 split ensures a reasonable outcome for both parties before inflation eats away at the value any further."
