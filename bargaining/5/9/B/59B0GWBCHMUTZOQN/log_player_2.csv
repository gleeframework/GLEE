"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
It's worth taking a chance to see if I can get a better deal.  While 1000 dollars is something, it's likely I can get more if I push for it.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to start with a pretty even split.  Since I know the money is losing value each round, I want to secure a decent portion early on.  We'll see if Alice agrees or if she wants to gamble on getting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's offer is better than the first round, I'm still not happy with it.  The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money, so I need to get a bigger share if I want to get anything worthwhile. I'll see what she offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to increase my proposed share slightly, but still keep it relatively even. Since I know the inflation is hitting me harder, I'm trying to be a bit more assertive in securing a larger portion for myself.  I'm hoping Alice sees the value of getting some money rather than risking getting nothing at all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offers are getting increasingly stingy, and I'm definitely feeling the pinch of inflation. However, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}
```

Inflation is seriously impacting the value of my share, so I'm going to push for a larger portion again.  I need to secure a good amount before it becomes worthless.  Alice has been rejecting my offers, but I'm hoping she realizes that getting something is better than nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and with only a few rounds left, I need to secure something. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than nothing and provides a decent amount of money.  It's time to cut my losses and accept the deal."
