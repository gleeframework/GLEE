``` 

I propose to take 9000 dollars, and Bob gets 1000 dollars. I want to start with a fair-ish offer, but I need to make sure I secure a good amount of the money early on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to be greedy here! I'm not going to accept a 55% cut of the money, especially since I know the value of my share is not decreasing. I'll keep fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a significant portion.  Bob rejected my previous offer and is now getting a 20% discount on his share, so I'm confident he'll be more reasonable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse! I'm sticking to my guns.  The inflation is hurting him, but I'm still in a strong position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to get a reasonable deal before things get too risky.  Bob's offer is getting worse, and I'm still losing nothing due to inflation. I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to take a smaller share now than to risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting incredibly desperate, but I'm not going to settle for a 20% cut. I'm confident I can do better. The inflation is really starting to hurt him, and I'm still in a strong position.  I'll keep pushing for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to take a slight risk here, but I believe Bob is starting to panic.  He's getting a really bad deal because of the inflation. I'm going to offer him a little more than my previous offer, but still keeping a majority.  If he rejects, I'm sure he'll come back with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
