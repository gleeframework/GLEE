"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving Bob with $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I think a 60-40 split in my favor is a better deal, what do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 40% share, especially since the value of the money is decreasing with each round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45% and take 55%, a more reasonable split""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 487500,
  ""bob_gain"": 512500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 51.25% and take 48.75%, a fair compromise""
}
```"
