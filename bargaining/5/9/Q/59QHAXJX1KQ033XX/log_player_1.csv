"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start with a clean slate.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm actually getting $320,000 (400,000 x 0.8).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting a smaller share, but I'm not sure if it's worth rejecting the offer. I'll think about it...
