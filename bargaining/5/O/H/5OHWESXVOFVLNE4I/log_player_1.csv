Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. 52-48 is a reasonable split.

# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is moving closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial to hold out a little longer. The inflation is hurting both of us, and he's likely to become more agreeable to a fairer deal as the rounds progress."
