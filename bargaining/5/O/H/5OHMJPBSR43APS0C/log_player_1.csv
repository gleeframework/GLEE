Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for the first round, Alice. Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor to compensate for the risk of further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
