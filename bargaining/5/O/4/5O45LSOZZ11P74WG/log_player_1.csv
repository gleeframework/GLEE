"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less after inflation, I'll have to think carefully. Since Bob is offering me a smaller share, I'll have to decide whether it's worth accepting.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}"
