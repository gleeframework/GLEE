"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This way, we both get $500,000, and we can end the game right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $500,000 from the first round is now worth $475,000 (95% of $500,000).

Considering Bob's new offer, I'd be getting $300,000, which is worth $285,000 after inflation. That's a significant reduction from my initial $475,000.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my $475,000 from the previous round is now worth $450,750 (94.625% of $475,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much""
}
```

This way, I'll get $420,000, which is worth $397,625 after inflation, and Bob will get $580,000, which is worth $547,375 after inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'll need a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $450,750 from the previous round is now worth $386,819 (85.74% of $450,750).

Considering Bob's new offer, I'd be getting $400,000, which is worth $385,200 after inflation. That's a bit better than what I'd get from my previous offer.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. If I reject it, the next round's money will be worth 5% less, which means I'll be getting even less.

I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
