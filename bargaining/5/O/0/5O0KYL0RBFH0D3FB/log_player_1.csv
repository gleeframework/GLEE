"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than the original $6000, so I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more favorable offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the original $10,000.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is catching up!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of my potential gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I still need to maximize my share.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
