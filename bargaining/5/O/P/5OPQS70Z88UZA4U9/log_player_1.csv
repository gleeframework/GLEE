"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 70 and you get 30. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This is a 70-30 split, which is a relatively even division of the $100."
