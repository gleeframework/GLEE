"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Now it's my turn to make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still being cautious.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, and the money Bob gains is still worth the same as in the previous round.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 47.5,
  ""message"": ""I'm being more aggressive now, but still reasonable.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to find a middle ground. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is getting out of control!

With the inflation, the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease. However, Bob's offer is still a reasonable one, and I'm starting to feel the pressure to accept.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
