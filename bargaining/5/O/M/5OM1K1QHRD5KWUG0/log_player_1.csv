"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80 and you can take 20. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering a 80-20 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I propose a 50/50 split.  This ensures we both get a good share, and it's a great starting point for a productive agreement. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 10% less, so if I accept Bob's offer, I'll be getting $45 (50 * 0.9).

I'm not sure if 50-50 is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of money. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so now it's worth 90% of the previous round's value. Since I rejected the 50-50 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer. 60 for me, 40 for you. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, hoping that Bob will accept this compromise."
