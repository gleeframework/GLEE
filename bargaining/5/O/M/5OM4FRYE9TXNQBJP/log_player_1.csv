"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I'm not sure I want to give up $4000. On the other hand, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going into another round and losing more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal than before, but I'm still not giving up too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not giving up too much to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much. You're getting closer to a fair deal, but not quite there yet. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gains. With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, $4800 is equivalent to only $3560 in real terms. I'm not sure I want to settle for that.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation! Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to get a better deal for myself, but I'm still willing to compromise. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less, but I'm not giving up too much to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit frustrated with these lowball offers. I think it's time to meet in the middle. Let's try to find a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation! With the money being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, $5000 is equivalent to only $2975 in real terms. It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure I want to settle for that.

However, I'm also aware that if I reject this offer, the value of the money will continue to decrease, and the next offer might be even worse. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
