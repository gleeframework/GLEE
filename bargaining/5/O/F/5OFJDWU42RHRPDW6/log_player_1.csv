# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, Alice, but I still think I deserve more. I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't think you're getting off easy. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled about accepting a 40% share, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds with the money's value decreasing even more.
