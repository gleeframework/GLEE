Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{

  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly biased split, but it's still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less after inflation, I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 60-40 split. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in round 2, I'll aim for a slightly better split. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more. Your turn!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less after each round!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll try to hold out for a better deal. Bob's offer is a bit too skewed towards him, so I'll reject it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 65-35 split. Can you meet me closer to 50-50?""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less after inflation, I'll aim for a slightly better split. Here's my offer:
