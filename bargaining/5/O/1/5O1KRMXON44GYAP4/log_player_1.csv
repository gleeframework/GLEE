"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 4:6 is a more reasonable ratio. It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
