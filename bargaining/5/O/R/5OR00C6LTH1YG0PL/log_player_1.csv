"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, with me getting 60% of the total amount and Bob getting 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is more favorable to me than my previous offer, I accept.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
