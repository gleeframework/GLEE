"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a small share to get us going.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $8,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $6,400.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'd be getting $4,500, which is less than what I was initially offered. I'll have to think carefully about this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, my gain is worth 64% of its original value (80% * 80% = 64%), so I'll have to be more aggressive to get a better deal.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy! I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still in the driver's seat.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
