I propose to take 990,000$ and give Bob 10,000$. This way, Bob will be happy to accept in the first round and we can both get something."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob 100,000$ and keeping 900,000$ for myself.  Since he rejected my initial offer, I'm going to try to be more generous this time, but I still want a larger share since I'm the one who's taking the risk of being left with nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is getting worse, and I'm still losing money due to inflation. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm offering Bob 190,000$ and keeping 810,000$ for myself. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and making an offer Bob might accept."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not appealing to me, given the heavy inflation. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm offering Bob 271,000$ and keeping 729,000$ for myself. The inflation is really hurting my potential gains, so I need to make an offer that is appealing enough to Bob without sacrificing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough considering the amount of inflation I'm facing. I need to secure a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of my earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}
```

This is a tough spot. I'm losing a lot to inflation, but I need to make an offer that Bob might accept.  I'm offering Bob 343,900$ and keeping 656,100$ for myself. It's a higher share for Bob than in the previous rounds, but I need to keep enough to make it worthwhile for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my share, accepting this offer at least guarantees me something.  It's better than getting nothing at all in the next round."
