"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too generous, let's try for more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to take a bigger share!

I'll have to be careful with the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, taking into account the inflation, I'd be getting $3200 (20% less than $4000) and Bob would be getting $5700 (5% less than $6000). I'd rather wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving away too much. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a slight increase in my share, but still trying to be cautious with the inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
