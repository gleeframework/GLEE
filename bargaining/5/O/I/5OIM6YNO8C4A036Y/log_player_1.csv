"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob getting 20%. The message is a friendly invitation to accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $4750.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a fair compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
