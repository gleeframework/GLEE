6000.0,4000.0,I propose dividing the money 3:2 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while accounting for potential inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think 3:2 is too skewed. Let's try a 7:3 split. It's a good balance between fairness and my own gain.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Considering the rejection of the previous offer, I propose an equal split of the remaining funds. This maintains fairness and avoids further negotiation complexities.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to compromise again. Considering the inflation, I think an equal split is too generous. I'll offer a 55:45 split in my favor. It's a reasonable compromise given the current situation.",Bob,4,
