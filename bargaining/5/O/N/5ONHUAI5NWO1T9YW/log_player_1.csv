I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money. This way, I hope to secure a quick agreement and minimize the impact of inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being quite greedy! While I understand the power of inflation, I won't be swayed by his ridiculous offer. I'll be more cautious with my next offer, but I won't settle for a measly 100,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I'm still giving Bob a decent share. I hope this will be more appealing than his last offer. I'm also taking inflation into account, knowing that my next offer will be worth less. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being incredibly stubborn.  His offer is still significantly skewed in his favor, especially considering the inflation we are facing. I'm not going to settle for this. I need to strategize better to reach a more equitable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This time, I'm going to offer Bob a much larger share, hoping that he will be more willing to compromise. I'm also taking into account the significant inflation we're facing. I believe this is a fair offer considering the circumstances."
