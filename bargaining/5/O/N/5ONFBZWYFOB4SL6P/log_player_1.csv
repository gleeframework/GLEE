"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm willing to meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll receive $3,000 and Bob will receive $7,000. It's not my ideal split, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
