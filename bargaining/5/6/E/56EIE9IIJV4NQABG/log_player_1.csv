I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This ensures a significant amount for me, while leaving Bob with something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm adjusting my offer to a 60/40 split. This reflects the inflation and gives Bob a slightly better deal than before. I'm hoping he'll find it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
With the inflation, the money is rapidly losing value. While I'd prefer a larger share, this offer gives me a significant amount and is close to a 50/50 split. It's better to secure a decent share now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
