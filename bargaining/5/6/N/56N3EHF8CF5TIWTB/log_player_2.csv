"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. This is my first and only offer. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is terrible, it's better to reject and see if Alice will adjust her offer.  The money is depreciating more rapidly for Alice, so there's a chance she might be willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm offering you a fair share.  Accept this and we both walk away with something.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  This is a much fairer split than your last offer. Take it before inflation eats away at my share even more. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still quite lopsided. It's better to reject and see if she'll offer a more equitable share, especially since inflation is hurting her more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with every round. Let's split the difference and end this. This is my final offer.""
}
