Send your offer to divide $10,000.","{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I prefer more money, the inflation is a significant factor.  In round 1, I was offering 9000, which is now worth 9000 * 0.9 = 8100.  Bob's offer of 5000 is still more than that, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the future.  It's best to take the sure thing."
