"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and Bob gets 30%, which is $30. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will see it as a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $50 is equivalent to $47.50 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems like a relatively even split. However, I'm hoping to get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain of $50 is equivalent to $47.50 in the current round's value.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of the gains in the first round's value:

My gain of $40 is equivalent to $34.49 in the first round's value.
Bob's gain of $60 is equivalent to $43.20 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems like Bob is getting a better deal than in the previous rounds. However, I'm getting a relatively small amount, so I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations.
