# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob is giving me $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, I'm not thrilled about it. However, I'm also aware that the money is worth less due to inflation, so I'll consider the relative value.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and proceed to the next round. Maybe I can get a better deal!"
