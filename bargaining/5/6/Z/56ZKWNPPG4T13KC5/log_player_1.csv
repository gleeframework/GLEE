"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 50 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 50 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, so I'll accept Bob's offer.
