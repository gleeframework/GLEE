"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, Alice! I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the actual amounts I would gain in this offer are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250 (since it's worth 20% less)
* Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.9 = 5555.56

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems like Bob is getting a slightly better deal than me. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, Alice, but I think this is the maximum I can offer without sacrificing too much. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, the actual amounts I would gain in this offer are:

* My gain: 4800 / 0.5168 ≈ 9291.15 (since it's worth 48.8% less)
* Bob's gain: 5200 / 0.7279 ≈ 7151.34

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems like Bob is still getting a slightly better deal than me. However, it's getting late in the game and the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'll accept this offer.
