"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer is a straightforward 100% for me and 0% for Bob. If Bob accepts, we can end the game immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 80, you can have 20. It's a good start, but I want more. 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. The 80 dollars I would get is still a decent amount, but I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm ready to settle for 80. Let's keep negotiating.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll offer a smaller amount to Bob. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, you can have 60. It's a fair compromise, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 70, you can have 30. I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the 70 dollars I would get is equivalent to about 55 dollars in the first round. I think I can do better than that.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to accept 30. I think I can get a better deal than that.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more careful with my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. 50-50 seems fair, considering the value of the money is decreasing.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
