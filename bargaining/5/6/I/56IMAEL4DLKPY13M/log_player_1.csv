"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the money to get the negotiations started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your initial offer, but I think I deserve more for my part in the negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, $5,000 is actually equivalent to $4,000 in the first round. And since Bob's gain is worth 5% less, $5,000 is equivalent to $5,250 in the first round.

Considering the relative values, I think this offer is still quite generous to me, and I'm not sure if I want to give up $1,000 more than I initially proposed.

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still need to get a fair deal for myself.""

I'm increasing my offer to $5,500, which is a bit more than my initial offer, but still a bit less than Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a more reasonable split considering the initial offer was 40% in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of $4,500 in this round is equivalent to $8,736.36 in the first round (since it's 100% / (1 - 0.488) = 1.976, and $4,500 * 1.976 = $8,836.4, but since we're rounding to 2 decimal places, it's $8,736.36).

Bob's gain of $5,500 in this round is equivalent to $7,352.60 in the first round (since it's 100% / (1 - 0.1426) = 1.235, and $5,500 * 1.235 = $6,782.5, but since we're rounding to 2 decimal places, it's $7,352.60).

Considering the relative values, this offer is still quite generous to me, and I think I can do better than this.

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise, considering the previous offers."
