"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! This is a generous offer!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 600,000 dollars and Bob gets 400,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. We both get the same amount, and we both get to move on. No need to risk losing money with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to split it evenly. I'd rather try to get a bit more. But Bob's offer is a good one, and I don't want to risk losing more money with each round. Let's see if I can do better next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to get a bit more. Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim for a higher amount for myself. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob. I'll take 550,000 and let you have the rest.""
}
```"
