Round 5

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that inflation is impacting me more, I need to remain firm. Accepting this offer would mean I'm losing more than half of the initial value, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and secure a more favorable outcome."
