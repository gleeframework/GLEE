"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get more now. I'll accept this offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
