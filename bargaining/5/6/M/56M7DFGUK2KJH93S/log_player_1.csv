"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $450,000, which is slightly less than half of the total amount, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him more likely to accept the offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer. If he rejects it, I'll have to make a new offer in the next round, taking into account the 5% decrease in the value of the money for me and the 10% decrease in the value of the money for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, even considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal. With the 5% decrease in the value of the money for me, I'd rather try to negotiate a better split than accept an offer that gives Bob more than half of the total amount. I'll make a new offer in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my decision and we can proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $475,000, which is closer to half of the total amount, taking into account the 5% decrease in the value of the money for me and the 10% decrease in the value of the money for Bob. The message ""Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle"" is an attempt to find a compromise and make Bob more likely to accept the offer, as we're both losing value with each passing round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer. If he rejects it, I'll have to make a new offer in the next round, considering the further decrease in the value of the money for both of us."
