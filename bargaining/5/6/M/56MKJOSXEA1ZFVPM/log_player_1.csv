I'm going for a slightly aggressive approach in the first round.  I'm keeping 90% of the money for myself and offering Bob a smaller portion.  I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept in the first round to avoid the risk of potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer guarantees me 5000 dollars, which is better than potentially getting less due to inflation in subsequent rounds.  It's a fair split in the face of the changing value of money."
