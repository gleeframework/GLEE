"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I'm framing it as a ""fair"" split, but I'm really hoping Bob will accept it since I'm offering a decent chunk to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a decent share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. I was hoping to get a better deal, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'm willing to negotiate further and try to get a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a slight majority""}

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer, taking a 70% share of the remaining $10,000, while still leaving 30% for Bob. I'm framing it as a ""compromise"" to make it sound like I'm being generous, but I'm really trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think this is a fair offer, considering the money is worth much less now due to inflation. I'm getting 50% of the remaining $10,000, which is a decent share. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game, as it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially getting an even worse deal."
