Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

It's finally time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation is killing the deal:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both of us. Waiting any longer will only result in a smaller reward, even if we manage to negotiate a slightly better split.
* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** She has offered this split twice now.  She might be getting desperate enough to accept a worse deal in the next round or two, but there's no guarantee. 
* **Something is better than nothing:** If we don't settle now, we risk walking away with nothing at all. Accepting the current offer guarantees us some profit."
