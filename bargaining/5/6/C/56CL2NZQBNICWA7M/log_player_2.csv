Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering it was my turn to propose. How about a 55/45 split? It's closer to the middle ground and still a decent amount for both of us, especially with inflation eating away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
