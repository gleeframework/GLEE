"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will see it this way and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to the initial offer, let's see if this works better for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is now worth 20% less than the initial offer, so I'd get $4800 in real terms.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's revised offer, as I'd prefer to get a larger share. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting an even worse deal.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
