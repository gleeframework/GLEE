Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said 50/50 is fair, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, accepting is the most logical decision for Bob, even if the deal isn't perfectly fair. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** Bob is losing a significant chunk of value due to inflation with each passing round (now at a 34.39% reduction).  Waiting any longer means accepting even less.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice is unlikely to offer a significantly better deal in the future. She knows time is on her side due to the inflation working against Bob.
* **Something is better than nothing:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a chance they might end up with an even worse deal or even nothing if the game continues and they have to make further concessions. 

While a 50/50 split seemed fair, Bob needs to be realistic about the game's dynamics and cut his losses."
