"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'll attach a friendly message to set a positive tone for our negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split the difference of our previous offers, considering the 5% inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer for now. The proposed split doesn't seem entirely fair to me, and I'd like to counteroffer in the next round. Considering the inflation, I'll need to calculate my next move carefully to ensure a favorable outcome.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 3\n{""alice_gain"": 5825, ""bob_gain"": 4175, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, adjusted for inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I've taken into account the 5% inflation that occurred in each of the first two rounds, which means the money is now worth 10% less than at the start. Considering this, I'll adjust my offer to ensure it's reasonable and fair. I'll propose that I receive $5825, and Bob receives $4175. This division factors in the devaluation of money due to inflation while still aiming for a relatively fair split. Let's see how Bob responds to this adjusted offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer - a perfectly fair 50/50 split.  Let's end this before inflation eats away any more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 4\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of the money by 14.26% since the first round, and taking into account the back-and-forth nature of our negotiations, I've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. At this point, aiming for a perfectly fair division makes sense, especially since further rounds would only lead to more devaluation of the money. Accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable decision to ensure we both walk away with a fair share, given the circumstances.\n\nLet's conclude the game here!"
