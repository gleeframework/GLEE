Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split things a bit more evenly this time. This offer ensures we both benefit.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm giving you one last chance before things get really bad with inflation... 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Alice's offer is still tilted in her favor, it's better than what I was offered in Round 1, and the effects of inflation are becoming increasingly significant. Accepting now avoids the risk of an even worse offer (or a significantly reduced total) in future rounds.
