"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering to split the money evenly, so we both get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd rather get a larger share now to compensate for the loss in value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
