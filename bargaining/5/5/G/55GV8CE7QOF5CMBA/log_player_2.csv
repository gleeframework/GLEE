Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you a better deal than you offered me. Don't be greedy, let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
 
This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses.  Alice is clearly aiming to take most of the pot and wait me out. Accepting a 4000 gain now is better than risking even further inflation on my potential earnings."
