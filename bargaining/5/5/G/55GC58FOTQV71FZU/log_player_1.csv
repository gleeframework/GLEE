Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point.  It gives you a good share, and I'm willing to go first to show I want a quick resolution. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
