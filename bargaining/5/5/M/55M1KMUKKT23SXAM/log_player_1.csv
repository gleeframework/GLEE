Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm the one taking the initiative!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but still want a good chunk of the money.  80/20 is fair considering Bob's last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's getting late in the game, and with inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'm better off taking the 20% now than risking getting nothing at all."
