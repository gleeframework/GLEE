I propose a 90/10 split, keeping 90 dollars for myself and giving 10 dollars to Bob. I figure it's a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a better agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
