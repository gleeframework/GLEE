"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's split it 70-30""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars and keeping 70 dollars for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. I'll take 80, leaving you with 20. Let's work together to find a fair solution. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'd have to adjust my thinking accordingly. With the current offer, I'd be getting 20 dollars, which is worth 95% of what I'd get in the previous round.

However, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, especially since Bob is getting a much larger share. I'd like to get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less again, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering the current value of the money."
