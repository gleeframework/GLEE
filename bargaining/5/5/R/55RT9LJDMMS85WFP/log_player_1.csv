"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  I think this is the most reasonable solution. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of splitting the money evenly, as it would mean I would only get $500,000, which is a significant decrease from my initial proposal. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the proposal""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000."
