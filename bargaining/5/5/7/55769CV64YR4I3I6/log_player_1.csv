Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob. I'm taking a big chunk, but it's the first round, and I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm not going to accept it.  I know that with each round the money is worth less, but I'm willing to gamble that I can get a better deal in the next round.  If Bob is so confident that he'll get a better deal for himself, then he'll be willing to wait.  I'm going to counter-propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 200,000 and keep 800,000 for myself.  Inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still confident that I can get a good deal.  I'm willing to give Bob a little more this time, but I'm still aiming for a majority share."
