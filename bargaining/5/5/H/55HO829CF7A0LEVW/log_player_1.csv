"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 evenly, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $300,000 is actually $240,000 in real value.

I don't think I'm willing to accept this offer, as I'd be giving up a significant portion of the original amount. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, with me getting $450,000 and Bob getting $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chance, but I'm still taking the majority 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 48.8% less than the original amount, so my gain of $200,000 is actually worth $104,000 in real value.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept this offer.
