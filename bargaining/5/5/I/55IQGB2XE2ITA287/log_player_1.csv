"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets $2,000. I'm trying to be generous, but not too generous, since I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. We'll both get more this way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the even split, but I don't want to risk getting nothing either.
