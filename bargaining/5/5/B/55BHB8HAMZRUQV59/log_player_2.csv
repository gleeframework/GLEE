"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's share fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. This is a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is fair. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic. I need to factor in the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  While the offer is the same as Round 1, the value of the money has significantly decreased for Bob. Accepting this now would mean losing a lot more to inflation than in earlier rounds.  It's a gamble, but Bob still has some leverage to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation makes my share worth more. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  This is getting dangerous. However, Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation situation. Accepting this offer would mean a huge loss for Bob due to the accumulated inflation. It's a tough call, but there's still a chance to negotiate for a less terrible outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Okay, I'm willing to compromise, but this is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's getting very risky now. Bob needs to signal that he's serious while still trying to get a somewhat reasonable deal. This offer leans more towards Alice's side, acknowledging the impact of inflation, but still aims to secure a larger share than her previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is severely impacting your share. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough pill to swallow, but with only three rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is too high.  Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation, but accepting now cuts my losses. Waiting any longer is likely to result in even worse offers, and potentially ending up with nothing."
