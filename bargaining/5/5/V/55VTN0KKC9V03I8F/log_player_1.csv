"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a very simple offer, as we have no information about Bob's strategy. By offering 90% of the money to myself, I am maximizing my gain in this round, knowing the money will be worth less next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm losing 30% of the money I originally proposed to take, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing with each round.  Accepting this offer secures a decent amount of money, and waiting could result in a lower overall payout due to inflation."
