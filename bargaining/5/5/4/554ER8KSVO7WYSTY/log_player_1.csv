"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than it was in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob is offering me $400,000, that's a 40% share of the remaining $1,000,000. Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth another 5% less due to inflation. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not going to give away too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share, but still trying to maintain a balance between the two of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 14.26% less than it was in the first round. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair share. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than before, but I'm still trying to maintain a balance between the two of us."
