Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  The inflation hurts you more than me, so take the deal while it's still good. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
