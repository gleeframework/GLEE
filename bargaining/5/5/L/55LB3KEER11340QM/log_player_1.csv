"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly less generous offer, but still a good one! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to negotiate further, 40 is a bit too low for me.""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 40/60 split, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob compared to the first round, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to push the boundaries a bit. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly more generous offer, but I'm not giving away too much! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get closer to the original 50/50 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept the 45/55 split. It's a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, as it's a more generous offer than the previous ones, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds."
