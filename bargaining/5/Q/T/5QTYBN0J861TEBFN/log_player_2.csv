# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split close to even, but I need a little extra to account for the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation. While my potential gains are diminishing, accepting a deal this low sets a bad precedent for future rounds. It's still better to hold out and counter-propose."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""The inflation is eating into my share significantly. I need a larger portion to make this worthwhile, otherwise we both lose out.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, and inflation is on my side 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  The pressure is on, but accepting this offer would mean losing almost half the value of my potential gain compared to the start.  Alice is clearly using the time pressure and inflation to her advantage. I'm hoping she'll become more reasonable in the next round or two, otherwise I'll be forced to accept a much lower offer to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer accounts for the severe inflation impacting my gains.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is crippling your share, take what's left 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is getting ridiculous! While 30 dollars is better than nothing, Alice is clearly trying to swindle me. I'm hoping she sees the urgency in the next round and makes a more reasonable offer. It's a huge gamble, but I have to try."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous! We're about to lose everything. My offer is more than fair considering the inflation. Take it or leave it, but we need to decide NOW!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I'm not. Last chance 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  It's painful, but I have to accept. Alice is ruthless and knows I'm out of options. Accepting 25 dollars, even with the massive inflation, is infinitely better than getting nothing in the final round."
