"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering we both have an equal chance of winning this game.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I would receive $6,000 and Bob would receive $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to get a better deal, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if this works. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 2-8 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not losing much value due to inflation.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
