I'm going to propose a pretty standard split.  I figure I should get the larger share since I'm making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy!  I'm not going to accept this offer.  I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to propose a more even split. I'm willing to give Bob a bigger share than he offered me, but I still want to get a majority since I'm the one making the offer.  Hopefully, he sees the fairness in this proposal!"
