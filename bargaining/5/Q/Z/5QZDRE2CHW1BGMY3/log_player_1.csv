"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I would receive $6,000 and Bob would receive $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this round, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of $3,000 to me and $7,000 to him. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is too one-sided. I'll reject it and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
