"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point considering the inflation factor that favors me. I'm confident Bob will accept this offer as it's a good starting point for him too."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better for me than the previous round, it still feels too unbalanced. I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit more, offering a 85/15 split. This is still a good deal for me, considering the inflation factor, and it might be attractive enough for Bob to accept, given the potential for further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired split, but I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal. I'll reject again and see if he's willing to budge more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split. This is a significant concession from my previous offer and I believe it's fair considering the inflation factor impacting Bob. I'm hoping this will be enough for him to accept."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, it's still not a fair deal considering the significant inflation affecting him. I'll reject and continue to negotiate for a more equitable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm offering a 75/25 split. This is a compromise from my previous offer, taking into account the increased inflation affecting Bob. I'm hoping this will be enough to reach an agreement before the inflation significantly impacts both of us."

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has been impacting Bob significantly, this offer is fair considering the circumstances. It's time to end this negotiation and secure a 50/50 split before things get even more challenging."
