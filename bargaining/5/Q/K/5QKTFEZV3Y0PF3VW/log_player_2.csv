**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is becoming the less risky option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer this drags on, the less the money is worth to both of us, especially Alice. Accepting now still gets us a decent amount.
* **Alice's Concessions:** She's moved down from her initial 60-40. She might be getting impatient and willing to settle. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Waiting for a better deal in later rounds is risky. If we reach the final rounds and fail to agree, we both get nothing.

It's a tough call, but at this stage, accepting seems like the safer option to guarantee a reasonable payout."
