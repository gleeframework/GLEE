Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation favors you, but a 50/50 split isn't fair to me. I'm proposing a more balanced approach for us both to benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
