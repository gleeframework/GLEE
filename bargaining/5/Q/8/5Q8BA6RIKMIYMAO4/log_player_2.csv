"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and leave you 10%.  We can negotiate from there. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Alice's offer is too one-sided, and I think we can do better. Besides, with inflation affecting Alice more than me, I have some leverage to negotiate. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more balanced. Since Alice is affected more by inflation, I'll try to find a middle ground that's closer to 50/50 but still favorable to me.
###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and adjust for inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  We can both get a decent amount, and we avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile Alice's offer seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the inflation factor. Since the money is worth the same to me but 19% less to Alice, I can try to negotiate for a bit more. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","With Alice being affected more by inflation, I'll try to make an offer that takes this into account. Since the money is worth the same to me but less to Alice, I can propose a slightly uneven split that still seems reasonable.
###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to make it more equal in value.""}"
