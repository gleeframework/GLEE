450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation working against me more.  Take the deal now, or it'll be less appealing for you in the next round.",Bob,2,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a small hit with a 52/48 split to end this now.  We're both losing money the longer this goes on.",Bob,4,
