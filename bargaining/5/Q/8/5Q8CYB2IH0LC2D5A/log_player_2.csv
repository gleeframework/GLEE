Alice's offer:

""alice_gain"": 450000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time. My turn, I get slightly more.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation is hitting me harder. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is correct that inflation impacts her more, her offer still heavily favors her. Accepting this offer would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table, especially considering the time pressure of the remaining rounds."
