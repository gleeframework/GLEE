Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable this time. A 55/45 split seems fair, considering the inflation factor.  
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
