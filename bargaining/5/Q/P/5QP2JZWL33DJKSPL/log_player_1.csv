"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'll reject this offer. I'm looking for a more equitable split, and Bob's offer is still slightly biased towards him. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}

I'm trying to get closer to a 50-50 split, but still giving Bob a slightly larger share to see if he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting! Bob's offer is the same as my previous offer, but considering the inflation, it's actually a slightly better deal for me since my money is worth the same as before.

I'll accept this offer.
