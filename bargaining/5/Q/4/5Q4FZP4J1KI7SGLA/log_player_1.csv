"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking. With this offer, I'd be getting 50% of the remaining value, which is equivalent to 50% of the original 80% (100% - 20% inflation).

Considering the reduced value, I think this is a decent offer. I'll accept Bob's proposal for now.
