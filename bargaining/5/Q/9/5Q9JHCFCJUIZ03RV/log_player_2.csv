"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 40-60, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll offer 45 for myself and 55 for Alice. This way, I'm still getting a slightly better deal than Alice's initial offer, and I'm not giving away too much.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is affecting my gains more significantly than Alice's. I need to be careful. Since Alice's offer is still quite lopsided, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll try to be more aggressive this time. I'll offer 50 for myself and 50 for Alice, hoping to get a fairer split before the money loses more value.
