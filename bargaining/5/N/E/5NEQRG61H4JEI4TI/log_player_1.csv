"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as excited about the 45% I'd get. But, I don't want to keep negotiating and risk getting an even worse deal. I'll accept Bob's offer.
