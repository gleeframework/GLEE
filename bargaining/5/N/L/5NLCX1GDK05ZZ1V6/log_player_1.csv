"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%. Let's seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems reasonable to me. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Consider it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining money. I'll reject this offer and propose a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'll try to get more. Let's see what you've got next!""
}
```"

Round 3
