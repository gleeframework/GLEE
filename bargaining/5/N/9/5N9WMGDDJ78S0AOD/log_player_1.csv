"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering to take 90% of the money and leave Bob with 10%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good deal early on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so my effective gain would be 0.95 x 900000 = 855000.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a significant concession from his initial position. I'll consider it. 

I accept this offer.
