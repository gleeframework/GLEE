"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000, and I'll take the rest. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, with me getting 900,000 and Bob getting 100,000. I'm trying to make a strong opening offer to see if Bob will accept or counter."
