"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective amount I'll gain in this round to be 90% of $300,000, which is $270,000.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain is now worth 10% of what it was in the first round, so I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```"

# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle this time! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
