"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not accepting your initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting the money, and I need to be strategic about my next move. Considering the offer from Bob, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not sure if it's the best I can get, and I'd rather wait for a better opportunity to get a higher share of the money. I'll keep pushing for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 20% less now, and I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 44% of the money, which is a slightly higher share than his previous offer, but still a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not willing to give you the majority, Alice. Meet me at 45/55 and we can end this! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly due to inflation, and I need to be careful not to get stuck with a small share. Considering Bob's new offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of 55% for me and 45% for him. It's not the majority, but it's a decent compromise, and I'm willing to take it to avoid further losses due to inflation. Let's end this and get what we can!"
