Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair deal now 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer isn't ideal, the inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, and continuing to reject offers risks losing even more. It's time to accept and secure something."
