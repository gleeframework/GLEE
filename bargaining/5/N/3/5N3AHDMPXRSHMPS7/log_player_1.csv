"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which is $6,000, and Bob will get 40%, which is $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, considering I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
