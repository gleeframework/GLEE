"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself.""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, with me keeping a slight majority of the funds. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given that we both have an equal say in the decision. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my gain accordingly. And since Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll take that into account as well.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 60/40 split, especially considering the inflation factor. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll give you $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. Let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's closer to a 50/50 split, but still slightly in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
