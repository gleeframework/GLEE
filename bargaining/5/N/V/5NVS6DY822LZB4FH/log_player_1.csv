"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split. We both get $50. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
