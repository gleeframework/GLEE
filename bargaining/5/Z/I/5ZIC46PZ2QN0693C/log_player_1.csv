Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 51/49 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point considering the inflation risk, and I'm hoping to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a good deal for me. Even with the inflation, I'm getting a decent share of the money, and it's better than risking another round and getting even less."
