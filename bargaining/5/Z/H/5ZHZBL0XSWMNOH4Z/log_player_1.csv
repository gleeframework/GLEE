Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 50/50 split. I'll give you 40%, but I need 60% to make it worth my while. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as keen on the 40% offer. I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 40% is enough for me. Can you consider 45%?""
