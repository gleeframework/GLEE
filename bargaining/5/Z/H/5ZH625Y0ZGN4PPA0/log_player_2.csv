Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the initial amount 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is compromising, the deal is still not favorable given the rapid devaluation of her share.  It's better to hold out a bit longer and hope she becomes more agreeable as the deadline approaches."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is a 50/50 split, the fairest I can offer.  The value will only continue to plummet, especially for you.  Let's end this now and both get something!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The longer the game goes on, the less favorable the outcome will be for both players. Offering a 50/50 split at this point emphasizes fairness and the urgency of the situation. It's a strong tactic to push for a resolution before the rapidly decreasing value makes any potential agreement negligible."
