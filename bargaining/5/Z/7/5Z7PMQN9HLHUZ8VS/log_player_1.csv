Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a deal that benefits both of us. How about we split it 60/40, with me getting the larger share this time? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us. How about we split the money 55/45, with me getting a slightly larger share? This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can avoid the risk of losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate and is now offering *less* than he would have gotten in round 2 (even considering the inflation).  This shows he's feeling the pressure. I'll continue to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 56,
""bob_gain"": 44,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a compromise. I'm taking a slightly smaller share to get this done. 56/44 is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** We're halfway through the rounds, and Bob needs to understand the urgency.
* **Diminishing returns:**  The longer this goes on, the less his share is actually worth.  
* **Firm but fair:** By increasing my offer slightly, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate, but also standing firm that I need the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We've both been stubborn so far. Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly. 50/50 is the fairest solution, and it ensures we both walk away with something.  Time is running out, and we don't want to lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice:

* **Significant inflation:** Bob's share has been hit hard by inflation. Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable amount.
* **Risk of losing it all:**  If I decline and we don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds, we both get nothing. 
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair, and Bob is unlikely to offer more than this considering the dwindling value of his potential gains."
