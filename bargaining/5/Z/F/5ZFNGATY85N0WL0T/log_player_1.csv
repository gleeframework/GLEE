Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer for Bob, hoping he'll accept. I'll keep a large portion for myself, but I want to avoid conflict and ensure the game ends quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not as good as my initial proposal, the inflation makes it much less appealing to risk further rounds.  A 50/50 split is fair given the circumstances."
