Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a big share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of getting less in the next round due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the guaranteed 500,000 than risk getting nothing if we continue."
