"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, I'll give you a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll re-evaluate Bob's offer:

* My gain: $50, which is 50% of the current value of the money (80% of the original $100, after inflation)
* Bob's gain: $50, which is 50% of the current value of the money (90% of the original $100, after inflation)

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round with the money's value decreasing further.
