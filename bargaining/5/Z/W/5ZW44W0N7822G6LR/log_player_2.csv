"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer. I'm willing to give you 10 dollars, which leaves 90 for me. This ensures we both get something, and it's a good starting point for negotiation.

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite imbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This round offers you a much better deal than you'd get if you wait.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway. A 45/55 split seems fair given the inflation. Let's try to reach a compromise and end this game before the money disappears completely! 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
