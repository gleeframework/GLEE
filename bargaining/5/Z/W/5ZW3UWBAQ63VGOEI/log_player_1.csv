"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\nI'll start by proposing a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. This is a relatively fair offer, considering we both want to maximize our gains. The message ""Let's be fair!"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept this reasonable proposal, avoiding further rounds and potential losses due to inflation.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly! We both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the proposal seems fair at first glance, with the even split of $5,000 each, considering the inflation, what we're actually getting is worth less than in the first round. For me, Alice, my potential gain is now worth 5% less, and for Bob, it's worth 10% less. Given that we've just started and have up to 12 rounds, there's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal, especially since the impact of inflation is more significant on Bob's end.\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust!""}\n\n###\nGiven the impact of inflation on both our potential gains, I'll adjust my offer slightly from the first round to make it more appealing to Bob while still maximizing my gain. The proposal now is $5,800 for myself and $4,200 for Bob. The message acknowledges the effect of inflation and suggests a compromise, aiming to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable adjustment, considering we both lose value the longer we negotiate.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to give you a bit more to avoid further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob's willingness to compromise and give me a bit more, the amounts offered ($4,500 for me and $5,500 for Bob) don't sufficiently account for the increasing impact of inflation. Given that we're only in round 4 and the money's value is decreasing significantly with each round (14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob compared to round 1), there's still considerable room for negotiation. The goal is to find a balance that reflects the urgency and the devaluing of the money over time, potentially leveraging Bob's greater loss to negotiate a more favorable deal.\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Countering your compromise!""}\n\n###\nConsidering Bob's last offer and the increasing pressure of inflation, I'll adjust my proposal to $5,600 for myself and $4,400 for Bob. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground, acknowledging Bob's willingness to compromise while still recognizing the greater impact of inflation on his potential gain. The message is a direct response to Bob's previous offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate but also a determination to secure a favorable deal.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time. Let's be realistic and accept a smaller gain for both of us to avoid getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob emphasizes the urgency and the risk of ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, the offer of $4,000 for me and $6,000 for Bob doesn't adequately reflect the impact of inflation on our potential gains. Given that we're halfway through the negotiations and the value of money is decreasing more significantly for Bob, there's still an opportunity to negotiate a deal that better accounts for these factors. Accepting this offer would mean I'm not fully leveraging the negotiation space available, especially considering the greater devaluation on Bob's side.\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Reflecting the urgency!""}\n\n###\nGiven the increasing urgency and the significant impact of inflation on our potential gains, I'll adjust my proposal to $5,400 for myself and $4,600 for Bob. This offer reflects the pressure of the negotiations reaching their midpoint and the substantial devaluation of the money, especially for Bob. The message acknowledges the need for a realistic approach, considering the time constraint and the devaluing money, aiming to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable compromise under the circumstances.\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. We need to come to an agreement quickly, otherwise we both lose everything! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Despite Bob framing this as his final offer and emphasizing the urgency of reaching an agreement to avoid losing everything, the proposed division of $3,500 for me and $6,500 for Bob is still not acceptable. Given the substantial impact of inflation, especially on Bob's potential gain (now worth 52.17% less than in the first round), and considering we still have a few rounds left, there's room for further negotiation. The difference in how inflation affects us suggests that Bob is under more pressure to settle, which I can leverage to potentially secure a better deal.\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Serious compromise before it's too late!""}\n\n###\nConsidering Bob's last offer was framed as his final one and the significant impact of inflation on our potential gains, I'll make a serious compromise. The proposal now is $5,200 for myself and $4,800 for Bob. This offer reflects the critical stage of negotiations we're in, with the value of money decreasing dramatically. The message conveys a sense of urgency and a genuine attempt to find a middle ground that acknowledges the pressure we're both under, aiming to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable and timely compromise.\n\nYour turn!"
