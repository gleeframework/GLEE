"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more to start""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30. I'm framing it as a fair split, but with a slight bias towards me to get things started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both get more if we cooperate. Let's try a more even split this time. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You said we can cooperate, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still within a reasonable range. I'm framing it as a compromise, meeting in the middle."
