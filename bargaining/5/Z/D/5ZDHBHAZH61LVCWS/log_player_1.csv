Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Alice. A fair deal is better than wasting time with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is facially fairer this round, I'm not convinced yet. He knows the inflation hurts me more than him, so he's likely to propose an even better deal for himself if I wait. I need to show him I'm willing to play the long game to get a decent share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm serious about getting a fair deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm slightly lowering my demand from 60 to 55 to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintain Advantage:** However, I'm not dropping to an even split. I need to demonstrate that I understand the impact of inflation and won't settle for a deal that significantly disadvantages me.
* **Urgency:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I want Bob to know that time is a factor. The longer we wait, the less favorable the outcome is for me."
