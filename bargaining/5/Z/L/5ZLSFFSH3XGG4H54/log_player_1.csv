"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 20% share for Bob and 80% for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the new values. 

In this round, I'll be gaining $5,000, which is 20% of the original $10,000, and Bob will be gaining $5,000, which is 50% of the original $10,000.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
