"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep most of the money 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% decrease in the value of the money I'll get, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

After calculating the effective value of the offer, I'll get $200,000, which is worth $240,000 in the first round. Not bad, but I was hoping for a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I was hoping for a better deal. I'll think about it and come back with a new offer.""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not satisfactory, I'll make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a fair deal""}

I'm proposing to keep $600,000 and give Bob $400,000. I'm trying to be a bit more generous than Bob's previous offer, but still maintain a decent margin for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but still keep most of the money 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money Bob gains due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I'll still consider it.

After calculating the effective value of the offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth $480,000 in the first round. It's not a bad deal, but I was hoping for a better split.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the future. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""I'll take this deal, but I was hoping for a better split. Let's hope we can do better next time.""}"
