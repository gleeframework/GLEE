"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. 50/50 split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a better deal than a 50/50 split. I'm hoping that Alice will offer me more in the next round to avoid losing the deal. Additionally, since Alice doesn't lose any value in subsequent rounds, she has less incentive to accept a lower offer from me, so I want to take the initiative to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this round, I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 5% less to me than in the previous round. I'm hoping that Alice will accept this offer, which gives me a slightly larger share, in order to avoid going to the next round where the money will be worth even less to me. By framing it as ""considering the inflation"", I'm trying to make the offer seem more reasonable and justified."
