"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to respond!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for Bob to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You could have taken the 2000, now it's my turn to make a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering the new values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: $4,000 (worth 5% less than the initial $8,000)
* Bob gain: $6,000 (worth 20% less than the initial $7,500)

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and proceed to the next round.

For now, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""A 50/50 split. Let's make it fair!""
}
```

I'm now proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to balance the scales and give Bob a better deal than my initial offer."
