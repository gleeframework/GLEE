Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable as we get closer to the deadline and my potential winnings decrease."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. I'm willing to be fair, but this is as low as I'm going.""}"

# Alice's message: Your loss is my gain, literally 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is eating away at my potential gains too significantly now. While not ideal, accepting this offer is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds if Alice continues to play hardball."
