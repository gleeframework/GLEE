"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial amount, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is more fair.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my initial reaction is that the split is even less favorable to me. However, I don't want to prolong the game and risk Bob making an even worse offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
