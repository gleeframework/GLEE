Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, time is money. But I still think I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is becoming increasingly more acceptable as time goes on.  The longer the game continues, the less Bob's share is worth due to inflation. Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal now is better than risking an even worse offer later, or even ending up with nothing if the game continues indefinitely."
