Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I get $700,000, you get $300,000.  It's a good offer considering the inflation we face.  Think about the long-term benefits rather than risking a smaller share later.

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a fairer deal, but the inflation really hurts your side more. Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This is a good compromise considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
