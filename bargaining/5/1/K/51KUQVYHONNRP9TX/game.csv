550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, I appreciate the attempt at a fairer deal, but the inflation really hurts your side more. Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. This is a good compromise considering the circumstances.",Alice,3,

480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. The longer we wait, the more we both lose. I'm proposing a 52/48 split in my favor. It acknowledges the impact of inflation on my end while still offering you a sizable sum.",Bob,4,
