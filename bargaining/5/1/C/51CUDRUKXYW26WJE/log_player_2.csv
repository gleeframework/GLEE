"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take one dollar and let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, I'm not going to get fleeced that easily. There's plenty of time to negotiate a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 950000,
""alice_gain"": 50000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a much fairer split. Take it while it's still worth something!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 90/10. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is better than her first offer, but still not good enough. Calling it her final offer at this stage is just a bluff. I think I can still push for a better deal, even with inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop playing games.  800,000 for me and 200,000 for you.  It's a generous offer considering the time pressure and inflation.  Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you more, Bob, but I won't let you take everything. Let's split it 75/25. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is getting closer, but I need to hold my ground a little longer. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gains due to inflation. I'm willing to gamble that she'll improve her offer rather than risk walking away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out.  This is my final offer: 70/30.  It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.  Let's close this out and both go home with a good chunk of money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm running out of time, Bob. I'm willing to go down to 60/40, but this is my final offer.  Accept it, or we both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  Alice is clearly playing hardball, and the clock is working against me. If I reject this offer, there's a real risk we'll both end up with nothing. It's not ideal, but 400,000 is still a significant sum, even after accounting for the inflation."
