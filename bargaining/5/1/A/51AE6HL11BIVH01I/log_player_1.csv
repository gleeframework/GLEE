"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but still give you a decent share""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but also implying that I'm being generous by giving Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about the idea of giving Bob a decent chunk, but I do appreciate the increased share. Considering the inflation, the 30$ Bob is offering is actually worth less than the 40$ he initially offered. On the other hand, the 70$ I'm getting is still a decent amount.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal!

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I'm not going to let you have the majority""}

I'm proposing a more aggressive split this time, with me getting 80% of the remaining 100$ and Bob getting 20%. I'm framing it as a ""small share"" for Bob, trying to make him feel like he's getting a poor deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a little bit more than last time 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

I'm not thrilled about the idea of giving Bob a ""little bit more"" than last time, but I do appreciate the increased share. Considering the inflation, the 25$ Bob is offering is actually worth less than the 30$ he initially offered. On the other hand, the 75$ I'm getting is still a decent amount.

I'll decide to...
