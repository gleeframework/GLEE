Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure it's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something rather than risking getting nothing at all if we reach the end of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, I'm taking this offer. Inflation is a real factor, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. A 45/55 split is better than a 0/0 split."
