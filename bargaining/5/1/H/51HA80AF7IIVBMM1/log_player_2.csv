Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000

**Reasoning:**

The longer the game goes on, the more the value decreases for Alice.  While this offer isn't ideal, it's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk Alice accepting even less in later rounds. Delaying further significantly disadvantages Alice, and she may be desperate enough to accept a much smaller amount soon, which would leave me with a less favorable outcome."
