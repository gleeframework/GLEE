"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I understand you want to be fair, but the money loses value over time. This offer is better for both of us in the long run.""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer (Round 1):** Alice's offer heavily favored her. While seemingly ""fair"" on the surface, it didn't account for the time-value of money due to inflation affecting Bob.
* **Bob's Strategy (Round 2):**  Bob needs to make a counter-offer that incentivizes Alice to accept *now*. 
    * He offers slightly more than Alice would have received in the previous round, acknowledging her desire for a larger share.
    * The message emphasizes the time-sensitive nature of the situation. The longer they wait, the less the total pot is worth to Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Explanation:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation. While she acknowledges the inflation, her offer still heavily favors her. It's clear she's banking on Bob becoming more desperate with each round. Bob needs to hold firm and make a counter-offer that benefits him more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is a fair 50/50 split, and it saves us both from further losses due to inflation.  Let's close the deal now.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Situation:**  The negotiation is at a critical point. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage, but she also risks Bob walking away entirely if her demands are too high.
* **Bob's Strategy (Round 4):** Bob needs to make a strong move that encourages Alice to settle. 
    * **50/50 Split:** By offering a perfectly even split, Bob removes any argument of unfairness. This appeals to Alice's initial ""fairness"" proposition.
    * **Finality:**  The message emphasizes that this is a final offer to avoid further losses.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Alice's Risk Tolerance:** If Alice is highly risk-averse, she might accept this offer.  However, if she's willing to gamble, she might push for more, hoping Bob will crack under the pressure of inflation.
* **Future Rounds:** If Alice rejects this offer, Bob needs to seriously consider whether any further negotiation is worthwhile. The longer it goes, the less favorable the outcome will be for him."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, it's time to settle. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Explanation:**

Alice is blatantly exploiting the situation now.  She knows Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, and her offer is downright insulting. While there's a risk she'll walk away, accepting this offer sets a terrible precedent and suggests Bob is desperate. 

**It's time for a strong counter-strategy in Round 6. Bob needs to signal he's willing to walk away if necessary.**"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. Accept it now, or we both walk away with nothing.""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Stakes:**  The inflation is severely impacting Bob. Alice is clearly exploiting this, but she also risks losing everything if the negotiations collapse.
* **Bob's Strategy (Round 6):**  This is a calculated ultimatum designed to maximize Bob's potential gains while minimizing further losses.
    * **Slight Concession:** Bob increases his offer slightly from the 50/50 split, acknowledging the time pressure but not caving to Alice's demands.
    * **Finality:** The message is clear and unambiguous.  This is not a bluff. Bob needs to convey his willingness to walk away if Alice doesn't accept.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Psychological Impact:** The ultimatum forces Alice to make a crucial decision. It injects uncertainty and the potential for immediate loss on her part, something she has avoided up to this point.
* **Limited Losses:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer cuts Bob's losses compared to continuing the game with dwindling returns.

**Important Notes:**

* **Alice's Response:** It's impossible to predict Alice's decision with 100% certainty. If she's extremely greedy, she might reject this offer, leading to a stalemate. 
* **Future Rounds:** If Alice rejects this offer and Bob doesn't follow through with his ultimatum, his negotiating position weakens considerably."
