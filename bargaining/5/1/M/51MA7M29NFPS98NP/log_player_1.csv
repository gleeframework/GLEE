"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 70/30 is a more reasonable split considering the risk of inflation. It's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
