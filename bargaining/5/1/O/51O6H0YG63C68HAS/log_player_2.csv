Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation, let's meet closer to the middle to benefit both, slightly leaning towards me for the initiative. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, and the value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. It's better to take a slightly less favorable deal now than risk getting even less in future rounds.
