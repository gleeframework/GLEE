"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money, but I'm also keeping a substantial amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'm now getting $640,000 (80% of $800,000).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting $100,000, which is worth 12.5% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob is getting $900,000, which is worth the same as in the first round.

I'll accept this offer.
