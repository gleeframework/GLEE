"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
I'm going to start with a pretty standard offer. I'll take the majority, but I'll give Bob a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is more fair than my first one, it's still not good enough for me. I'm going to risk it and hope I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm going to try to split the difference from Bob's last offer. I'll propose a 60/40 split in my favor, hoping that Bob sees the value in ending the game now and doesn't want to risk further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, but I think it's time to accept.  My money is losing value significantly, and Bob seems to be holding firm. This deal is closer to what I want than my last offer, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
