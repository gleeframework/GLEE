"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 60/40 split seems a bit unfair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of the money being worth less in the next round to try to get a more equal share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to negotiate for a more equal share. Since the money is now worth 20% less, I'll take that into account in my proposal.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}"
