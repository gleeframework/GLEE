"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your last offer was too generous, I'll take a fair split this time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, my gain of 50 is actually equivalent to 50 / 0.9 = 55.56 in the first round's value. And since Bob's gain is worth 5% less, his 50 is equivalent to 50 / 0.95 = 52.63 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is still relatively fair, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll make a counteroffer: 55 for me, 45 for you""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the second round. So, my gain of 55 is actually equivalent to 55 / 0.9 = 61.11 in the second round's value.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the reduced value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair split""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still not giving me enough, I want a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round's money:

My gain of 45 is worth 45 / 0.271 = 166.09 in the first round's value.
Bob's gain of 55 is worth 55 / 0.8626 = 63.65 in the first round's value.

Considering the significant difference in the equivalent values, I think Bob's offer is actually quite generous. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
