"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I propose to keep 950,000 dollars and give Bob 50,000 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose to keep 800,000 dollars and give Bob 200,000 dollars. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise given the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose to keep 600,000 dollars and give Bob 400,000 dollars. I believe this is a reasonable offer, considering the decreasing value of money with each round.  This is a more aggressive offer than my previous ones, but I feel it's necessary to avoid further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is too low. While I realize the value of the money is declining, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal.  I am not willing to accept such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. With the inflation rate, we are both losing a significant amount of money, and I believe this is the fairest way to proceed."
