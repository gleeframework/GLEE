"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000$ and Bob getting 400,000$. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering your offer last round. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to reevaluate the offer.

Considering the 10% decrease in value for me and the 5% decrease for Bob, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 350,000 * 0.9 = 315,000
* Bob's gain: 650,000 * 0.95 = 617,500

I'm not sure if the 65-35 split is fair, considering the decreased value of the money. I'll reject the offer for now and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 65-35 is fair with the decreased value. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try 42-58, it's a fair split considering the reduced value.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting 420,000$ and Bob getting 580,000$. The message is a friendly one, hoping to find a mutually acceptable agreement."
