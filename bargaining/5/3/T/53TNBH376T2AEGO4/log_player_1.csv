"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split to start, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice! Let's try for a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to be so bold!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is $9,000 (due to inflation), and Bob is offering me $2,000. That's a 22.22% share, which is still a bit too low for my taste.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, the total amount is now $9,000. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise on a 50-50 split, Bob. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this more balanced proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, Alice, but I think I can do better than that. How about I take a bit more? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, another rejection!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, the total amount is now $7,300 (from $10,000). Bob's offer is $4,000 for me, which is a 54.8% share. That's a bit too low for my taste.

However, I'm starting to get a bit desperate, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less money. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his word.
