"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but we'll see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to take a smaller share, even if it's still a good deal. I'll try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is catching up! The money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means I'll have to be even more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll take this offer. It's a decent split, and I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round. Plus, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a worse deal later on!"
