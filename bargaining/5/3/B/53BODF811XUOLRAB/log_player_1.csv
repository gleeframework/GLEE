"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, my gain in the second round would be 80% of 80% of $100, which is 64.

However, I'm not interested in accepting Bob's offer of splitting it evenly, since I'm hoping to get more than 50% of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% of what it was in the first round (80% * 0.8 = 64% of the original amount, and 64% * 0.8 = 51.2%). My gain would be 51.2% of the original $100, which is $51.20.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 51.2,
  ""bob_gain"": 48.8,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but don't expect it to last!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game."
