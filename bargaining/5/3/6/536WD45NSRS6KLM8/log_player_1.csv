"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it a bit more worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Consider the impact of inflation on my proposal.
Inflation reduces the value of the money I gain by 10% each round, but it does not affect Bob's gain. This means that with each passing round, the effective value of the money I propose to gain decreases, while Bob's share remains unaffected by inflation.

### Step 2: Evaluate the previous offers and outcomes.
In Round 1, I proposed a 60-40 split in my favor, which Bob rejected. In Round 2, Bob proposed a 45-55 split in his favor, which I rejected. Given the rejection of these offers, it's clear that we are negotiating the balance between our shares.

### Step 3: Determine the strategy for Round 3.
Given the impact of inflation and the previous rejections, I need to adjust my proposal to make it more acceptable to Bob while considering the decreasing value of my share. A compromise that takes into account Bob's more generous offer in Round 2 and the need to counteroffer is necessary.

### Step 4: Calculate the new proposal considering inflation.
Since inflation decreases the value of my gain by 10% each round, by Round 3, the money is worth 20% less to me than in the initial round. However, the actual amount of money doesn't change; what changes is its value to me. Given this, I need to consider the psychological and strategic aspects of the negotiation rather than just the monetary value.

### Step 5: Decide on the message to accompany the proposal.
The message should convey a sense of compromise and an acknowledgment of the negotiations' progress, aiming to persuade Bob to accept the offer.

### Step 6: Finalize the proposal and message.
Considering the need for compromise and the impact of inflation, I will propose a split that is closer to Bob's offer in Round 2 but still advantageous to me, considering the negotiation dynamics.

The final answer is:
{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway from our last offers.""}"
