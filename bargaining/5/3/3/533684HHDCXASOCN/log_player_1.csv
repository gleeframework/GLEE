Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You are losing a lot due to inflation. You should accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly trying to exploit the situation and is unlikely to agree to a fair deal.  While 280,000 is significantly less than I aimed for, rejecting this offer means risking even further losses due to inflation. It's the best I can get at this point."
