"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm trying to get the majority of the $10,000. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $5000 I would gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $4000. That's a bit more reasonable than my initial offer. I'll accept Bob's offer.
