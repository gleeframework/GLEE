"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division where I take $60 and Bob takes $40. Given the rules of inflation, where the money's value decreases more significantly for Bob, I've adjusted the offer to slightly favor myself while still appearing somewhat fair. The message is designed to appeal to a sense of fairness and reasonableness, aiming to persuade Bob to accept the offer early on to avoid further loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's end this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the adjusted values due to inflation, Bob's offer doesn't seem as appealing, especially considering the message is trying to persuade me that it's a fair split. With the money being worth less in each round, I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a better outcome for myself. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially leveraging the increasing pressure of inflation on Bob's end to secure a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation hit you harder, this is a reasonable adjustment""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer to take into account the increased pressure of inflation on Bob's end. By offering Bob $43, which is slightly less than what I offered initially but still more than what Bob would get if we continue and the money devalues further, I aim to appeal to Bob's sense of urgency. The message highlights the impact of inflation, suggesting that accepting this offer is in Bob's best interest to avoid further loss."
