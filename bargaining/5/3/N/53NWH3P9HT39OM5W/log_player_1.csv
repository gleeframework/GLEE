"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $100,000 is actually worth $80,000 in the original amount, and Bob's gain of $900,000 is worth $855,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer. My goal is to get as much as possible in the original amount, and this offer doesn't seem favorable enough.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2. Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%."
