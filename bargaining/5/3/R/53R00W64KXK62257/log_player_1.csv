"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see how it goes.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of rejecting your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 3000 x 0.9 = 2700
Bob gain: 7000 x 0.9 = 6300

I'm not thrilled with the new proposal, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'd like to counter with a new proposal that gives me a slightly larger share."

}
```

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the actual values are:

# Bob gain: 7000

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
