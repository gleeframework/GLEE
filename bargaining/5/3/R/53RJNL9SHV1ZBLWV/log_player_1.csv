"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob thinks he deserves a bigger share for his negotiating skills. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think Bob's negotiating skills are worth a 3:1 ratio. I'm hoping to get a better deal next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You think you deserve more for negotiating, but I think I'm being generous here. Accept and let's move on.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground and offer Bob a slightly lower amount than his previous offer, while still being more generous than my initial offer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit stingy, I'm starting to think you're not serious about dividing the money

# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to pressure me into accepting his offer by making me look stingy. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to let Bob bully me into accepting an offer that's even more skewed in his favor. I'm hoping to make a better offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not being stingy, I'm being strategic. Let's find a fair middle ground.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the original 50/50 split, but still slightly favors me."

Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but still wants to maintain a sense of fairness. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a fair offer, and I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split. Let's wrap up the game!"
