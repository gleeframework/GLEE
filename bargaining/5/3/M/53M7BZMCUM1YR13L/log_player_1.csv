I want to keep pushing for a better deal.  Even though the money Bob is receiving is worth less each round, I think I can get a better split for myself."

I'm trying to offer a slightly higher gain for myself than Bob's last offer, hoping to incentivize him to accept before the inflation hits him too hard."

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse with each round due to the inflation,  I can still likely secure a better deal for myself by rejecting and making a counter offer.  It's risky, but there are still a few rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm offering a higher share for myself than Bob's last offer, but I'm also trying to be reasonable to avoid risking it all in the final round.  We're both losing value with each round, but I think I can secure a better deal by offering a slightly higher share than Bob is offering now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only one round left, the risk of getting nothing is too high. While I would prefer a better deal, Bob's offer is still enough to secure some money, and I need to be realistic about the situation. It's better to get something than nothing at all."
