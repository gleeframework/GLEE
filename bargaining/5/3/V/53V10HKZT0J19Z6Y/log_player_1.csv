"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering you 40% of the money, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a 50-50 split, which is fair.
