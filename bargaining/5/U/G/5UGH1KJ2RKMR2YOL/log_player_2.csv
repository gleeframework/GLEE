Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I get to make the next one. Given the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is worth less, but Alice's offer is still slightly in her favor. I'll try to adjust accordingly. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, and it's worth 20% less than in the second round, it's now worth 64% of its original value. I'll make an offer that accounts for this reduced value. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 64, ""alice_gain"": 36}"
