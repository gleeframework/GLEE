"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so I'm not as happy about it.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Let's try again!

I'll make a new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 36 
# Bob gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share!

Considering the drastic drop in value of Bob's share, I'm feeling more inclined to accept this offer. The 36 dollars I'd get is still worth the same as in the first round, so I'm not losing out too much.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
