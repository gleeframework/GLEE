"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While a fair split is tempting, it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Alice's offer gets progressively worse for her with each round, making it advantageous to reject and see if she offers more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I think we can do better. Let's flip the script this time."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
Alice's offer is closer to my preferred split, and with the inflation factor working in my favor, it's a good time to secure a decent gain."
