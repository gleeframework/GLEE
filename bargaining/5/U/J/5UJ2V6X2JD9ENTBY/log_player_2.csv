Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good deal.  Let's be smart and split this evenly before inflation eats away any more of our potential gains. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
