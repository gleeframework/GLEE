"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to try to get a good deal for myself, considering the high value of the money at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a toll, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that. However, this offer is a 50/50 split, which is a good compromise. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I want to try to get a better deal for myself, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the rejection, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping that the inflation effect will make his gain worth even less, and I'll get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger toll on Bob's gain, I'll have to reassess the situation. Considering the significant decrease in Bob's gain, I think this offer is a good opportunity for me to get a decent deal. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $4000, considering the inflation effect on his gain."
