Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the value is decreasing. This is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is consistently offering more to herself, even with the faster devaluation.  I need to hold out for a better deal.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, my offer is more than fair considering the devaluation. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement. This offer reflects the time pressure and is better than what we can expect in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

```
Although Alice claims she's aiming for a mutually beneficial agreement, she is still consistently asking for more than half.  While the offer is tempting, I think I can get her to go lower as the rounds progress and the pressure mounts.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable split considering the circumstances.  Let's be practical and end this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time.  This offer is a slight concession on my part, but it ensures we both walk away with something substantial. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

```
Alice is finally agreeing to take less than half, and with the increasing devaluation, waiting any longer is too risky. It's better to accept a slightly unfavorable deal than risk getting nothing at all.
