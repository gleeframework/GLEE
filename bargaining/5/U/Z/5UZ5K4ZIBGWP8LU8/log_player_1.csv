"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than before. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. The inflation is eating into my potential gain, and I'd like to try to get a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of my potential gain each round, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share.""
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, given the decreasing value of the money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fair split considering the situation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a significant toll on my potential gain. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. With inflation eating away at my potential gain, I think this is a decent compromise. I'll take the 5000 dollars and hope that Bob will hold up his end of the deal."
