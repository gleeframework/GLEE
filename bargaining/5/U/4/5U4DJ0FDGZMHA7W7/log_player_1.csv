Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. How about a 55/45 split? It's more equitable and avoids further losses due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
