"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I receive 70% of the initial 100$ and Bob receives 30%. I'm trying to make a fair offer to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's a better outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob is proposing an even split, I'm tempted to accept. However, I was hoping to get a slightly better deal since I made the first offer. But considering the inflation, 50% of the remaining value is still a decent outcome.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
