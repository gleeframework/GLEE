"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8550, ""bob_gain"": 1450}
```

Since Bob rejected my offer in round 2 and the money is worth less for me due to inflation, I'm proposing a slightly more even split, taking $8,550 and giving Bob $1,450. I hope this is more appealing and we can reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm unhappy with this split, I realize that the inflation is significantly impacting my gains. I need to secure at least some money, and I'm afraid if I reject this offer, Bob might become more greedy in the future.  I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses."
