"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose keeping 9000 for myself and giving 1000 to Bob. This is a fair starting point, considering I'll be the one facing the inflation risk.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, I have to consider the inflation factor.  Accepting this offer means I get 7500, which is worth less than 9000 from the previous round, but better than facing further inflation and potentially getting nothing."
