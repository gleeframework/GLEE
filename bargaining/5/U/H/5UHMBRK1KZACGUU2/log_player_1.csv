```

  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is taking a bigger share, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather not give up as much as 20% of the potential gain. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
