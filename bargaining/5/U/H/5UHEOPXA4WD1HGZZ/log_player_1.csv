"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose taking almost everything, leaving Bob with a single dollar.  Since this is the first round, the inflation won't affect our gains significantly. I figure a single dollar is better than nothing for Bob, and he'll likely accept to avoid being in a worse position in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, this is a decent deal. In the next round, Bob's offer would be worth even less to him due to inflation.  It's better to take what's on the table now and avoid the risk of getting less later."
