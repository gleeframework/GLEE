"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is close to a 50/50 split, it's important to remember that Bob has the advantage of time in this scenario.  Rejecting this offer and proposing a more equitable split in the next round will likely result in a better outcome for Bob, even with the 5% inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Let's be practical, Alice. I'm offering a slight advantage to me since I have time on my side. This ensures we both benefit rather than risking getting nothing.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Advantage:** This offer gives Bob a slight edge (52.5% vs. 47.5%) reflecting the time advantage.
* **Urgency:** The message highlights the risk of inflation, encouraging Alice to accept a reasonable deal now. 
* **Future Rounds:**  If Alice rejects, Bob can afford to gradually decrease his share in subsequent rounds, still aiming for a better outcome than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on the advantage, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly conceding, but it's still early in the game. Her offer is only slightly better than her first one, even considering the inflation.  Bob can afford to hold out for a more favorable split, using his next turn to propose a more enticing deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice. This is a fair offer considering the inflation. Let's secure our share before it's too late.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Bob is reducing his demand slightly, showing a willingness to compromise but still aiming for a slight advantage.
* **Emphasizing Inflation:** The message reinforces the time pressure, nudging Alice toward a deal. 
* **Near Even Split:**  Offering a near-even split at this stage makes it harder for Alice to justify rejecting, especially given the shrinking pot."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split it almost evenly, considering inflation, we're both losing out if we don't agree soon 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The cumulative inflation is now significant. Accepting a near-even split at this point is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds, or even getting nothing.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation and seems keen on a deal. It's unlikely she'll offer significantly better terms.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds remaining, the risk of reaching no agreement and getting nothing is escalating. 

This is a good time for Bob to accept the offer and secure a reasonable share, even if it means a slight advantage for Alice."
