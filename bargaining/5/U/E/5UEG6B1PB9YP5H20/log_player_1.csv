"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both walk away with a good amount!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping 600,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try again! I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think we can both benefit from this deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer. With 20% less value, I'd be getting 450,000, which is equivalent to 45% of the original amount. And Bob would be getting 550,000, which is 55% of the original amount.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better one. I'll have to think carefully...

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation in mind, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's offer was 55% of the original amount, I'll aim for a higher percentage for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000, which is 45% of the original amount, and keeping 550,000 for myself, which is 55% of the original amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think I deserve a decent chunk of the pie. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! With 48.8% less value, I'd be getting 520,000, which is equivalent to 52% of the original amount. And Bob would be getting 480,000, which is 48% of the original amount.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or wait for a better one. I'll have to think carefully...

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'm starting to feel a bit more pressure to accept a decent offer. But I'm not sure if this is the best I can get...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up!

With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be strategic about my next move. I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage for myself, considering the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 420,000, which is 42% of the original amount, and keeping 580,000 for myself, which is 58% of the original amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you an equal share, but I think we can both benefit from this deal. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a hit on the money's value! With 67.23% less value, I'd be getting 500,000, which is equivalent to 50% of the original amount. And Bob would be getting 500,000, which is also 50% of the original amount.

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'm starting to think that an equal split might be the best option. It's not the highest percentage I could get, but it's a fair split, and I don't want to risk waiting for an offer that might not come.
