"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'll reject the offer for now. It's not a bad starting point, but I think I can do better considering the inflation will affect Alice less than me. I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly this time. The inflation is going to affect us both, so a fair split seems like the best option.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I took into account the inflation, my previous offer was quite generous, this one is a bit more realistic 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is getting worse, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I know I need to be more aggressive with my offers to make up for the inflation hitting me harder."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be more flexible this time, but I need a better deal than the last round.  I'm proposing we split it closer to 55/45, which is still fair considering the inflation difference.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation difference, I need a bigger share. This is my most generous offer yet 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is becoming increasingly unfair.  While I'm feeling the inflation more, I'm not ready to concede this much.  I'll continue to fight for a fairer split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""The inflation is hitting me hard now, but I'm still holding out for a more even split. I'm proposing 48/52.  This is a fair compromise, given the circumstances.""}
