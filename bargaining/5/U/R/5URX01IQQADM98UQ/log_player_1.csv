"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both enjoy a nice dinner!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a fair share, and I get to keep $70. The message is just a friendly reminder that we can wrap up the game and move on to more pleasant things."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping for a better deal, considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. Let's end this!""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50-50 split, which seems fair given the reduced value of the money."
