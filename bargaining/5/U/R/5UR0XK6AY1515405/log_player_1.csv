"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I'm proposing a 950,000/50,000 split.  It's a big advantage for me, but I figure it's fair enough to get the game started.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a terrible deal for me.  Even though I'm losing 5% due to inflation, Bob is losing 20% on his share.  There is still room to negotiate, I will make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 600,000/400,000 split. This is a more even split than Bob's offer, and while I'm still taking a hit from inflation, I'm hoping this is more appealing to Bob than his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is actually not bad for me, considering the amount of inflation that has happened. Even though my share is smaller than what I originally wanted, Bob is losing a lot more due to inflation.  I'll accept this offer to avoid further risk."
