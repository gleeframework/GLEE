"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% and keep 90%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal for Round 2.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about whether this offer is fair. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best option, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to propose again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 30% and keep 70%, it's a good compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60/40 split. I'm willing to be generous, but I need to see some fairness in the division. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the new offer from Bob, I'll think carefully about it. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think a 60/40 split is a reasonable compromise, and it's better than my previous offer. I'll accept Bob's proposal and end the game."
