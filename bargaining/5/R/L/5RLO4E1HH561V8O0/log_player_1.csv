"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the total, and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not being too generous yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less, but I still need to make a decision.

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less now (20% less from the previous round), I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7200,
  ""bob_gain"": 2800,
  ""message"": ""You're not being too generous yet, so I'll try to meet you in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to give you an easy win 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly now.

I'll accept this offer. It's a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the decreasing value of the money.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
