"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No need to complicate things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since Bob's offer is to split it evenly, I'll have to consider the current value of the money. Since my money is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have $50, and Bob will have $50, but for Bob, the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, so he'll effectively have $45.

Considering this, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more considering the initial offer I made.""}

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me $70 and Bob $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I don't think your offer is fair. How about we split it 45/55? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze Bob's offer...

Since my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have $55, and Bob will have $45, but for Bob, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so he'll effectively have $32.73.

Considering this, I'll decide to...
