"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I'm hoping Bob will be greedy and accept it.  If not, we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see how this plays out. I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer in my favor either. It's time to get serious about negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I'm going to propose an even split.  It's fair and hopefully, Bob will see the logic in it."
