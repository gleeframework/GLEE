"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob. Take this small amount and we can end this quickly. ðŸ˜Š 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a terrible deal for Bob, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm taking the lion's share this time, but you'll get a chance to even things out next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering a good chunk of the money to end this game.  We both get a fair share, and we can avoid more inflation losses.  Let's be reasonable, Bob.  
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is much better than the first, it's still not a great deal considering the inflation rate.  It's worth seeing if Alice will offer something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Alice. Let's split the money 60/40, and we can finally end this game.""}
