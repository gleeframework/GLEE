"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game, with each of us getting $5,000. This way, we both have a decent amount to work with, and we can assess the situation and adjust our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a decent one, since it's the first round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, especially since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'd like to aim for a more balanced split, so I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob to make another proposal in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but still a decent one for myself""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial 50/50 offer. I'm hoping that this compromise will be more appealing to him, and we can move closer to a settlement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this time, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really struggling with the decreasing value of the money, and the 35/65 split is too unfavorable for me. I'd like to aim for a more balanced split, especially since the money I gain is worth significantly less than in the first round. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob to make another proposal in Round 5."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 4200, ""bob_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, but I'm trying to hold on to as much value as possible in these inflationary times""}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my previous offer. I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and holding on to as much value as possible in this inflationary environment."
