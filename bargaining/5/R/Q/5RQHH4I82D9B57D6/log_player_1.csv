Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split, keeping the majority for myself. This is a strong opening move, demonstrating my desire to claim the lion's share while leaving Bob with something to consider. It's a risky move, as he could reject it and potentially get a better deal in the next round, but the risk is mitigated by the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer to keep more of the money, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Accepting a 50/50 split ensures a decent gain for me, and it avoids the risk of getting a worse offer in the next round."
