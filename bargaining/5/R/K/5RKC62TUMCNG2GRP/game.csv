3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, your offer was quite lopsided. Let's be more realistic. How about a 70/30 split?  Remember, the value of the money decreases for both of us with each round.",Bob,2,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, time is running out, and the value is slipping away with each round. I'm offering you a 40/60 split.  Let's settle this now and both walk away with something substantial.",Bob,4,
