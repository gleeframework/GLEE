"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and allows us both to benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer seems reasonable at first glance, the fact that the money devalues over time for me makes it unacceptable. I need to aim for a larger share in the early rounds to make up for the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. Given the time pressure and the fact that the value decreases for me each round, I need a larger share. This offer still gives you a significant sum.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your previous ask was too low for me. This offer is a compromise -  closer to my original proposal and still nets you a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to understand the pressure, but her offer is still not good enough.  The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me. I need to push for a more significant share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This offer is my bottom line. It accounts for the time pressure and still gives you a good portion.""}
```"
