Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is affecting us both, but I think I can get a bit more, considering it affects you more 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option.  Inflation is hitting me harder, and continuing to reject offers may lead to a situation where I get nothing."
