Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up more than 45% of the total, but I'm willing to meet you halfway on the remaining amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While the inflation hit me harder, I'm accepting this offer for the following reasons:

* **Risk of losing more:** If I reject, the next round will further diminish my potential gain. There's no guarantee Bob will make a better offer.
* **The offer is not bad:**  While I'm getting less than I initially desired, it's still a decent share. 
* **Potential for future negotiation:**  While this ends the game, I could potentially approach Bob later to negotiate a better deal, as we have already established a dialogue."
