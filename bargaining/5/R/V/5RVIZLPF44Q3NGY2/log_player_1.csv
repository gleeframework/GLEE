Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering future losses.""

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, considering that the money loses value over time, and I'd like to conclude the deal quickly to minimize losses for both of us. Your turn, Bob!"
