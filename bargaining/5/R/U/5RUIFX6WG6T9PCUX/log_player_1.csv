"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, as inflation will significantly reduce its value in later rounds. While this is a generous offer for Bob, it's in my best interest to take a large share now and minimize the impact of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my proposal to 80/20.  Inflation is a serious concern, and I need to secure a substantial amount of money before it erodes the value further. While it's a less generous offer than the first round, I believe it's still a fair compromise considering the changing dynamics of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it is still significantly less than what I would have gotten in the first round. I believe I can still secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Inflation is hurting my potential earnings, but I am confident I can achieve a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going down to 70/30.  Inflation is making each round more risky.  I need to secure a large portion of the money now.  While I'm willing to compromise, I believe this offer is fair considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is more equitable than his previous one, it is still significantly less than what I could have secured in the first round. The inflation is hurting, but I believe I can negotiate a better outcome. I'm still willing to compromise, but not at the cost of losing a considerable chunk of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my proposal to 60/40.  Inflation is a serious concern, and I need to secure a large portion of the money before it erodes the value further. This is a fair and reasonable offer given the current circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is becoming increasingly equitable, I'm still holding out for a better deal. The inflation is a significant factor, but I believe I can secure a larger share by continuing to negotiate. I am confident that I can achieve a more favorable outcome in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only a few rounds left, inflation has become a major factor, making it essential to secure a substantial amount of money now.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is fair and recognizes the urgency of the situation. This ensures both of us receive a significant share of the remaining money."
