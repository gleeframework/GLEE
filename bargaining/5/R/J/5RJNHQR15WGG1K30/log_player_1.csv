"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'll let Bob know that I'm open to negotiations if he's not satisfied with this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal. Maybe he'll come up with something better!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 40/60 split, I'll try to counter with a 55/45 split in my favor. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still looking for a fairer split!""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to compromise!"
