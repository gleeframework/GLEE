Let's see if Bob likes a generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not sure if Bob realizes inflation is making his offer worse with each passing round. Let's see if he'll come back with something better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob will take this chance, or risk having to propose something even more generous in the next round."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is getting greedy! Inflation is hurting him more than me at this point, so I'm going to keep rejecting and see if he finally realizes that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm still holding out for a good deal. Inflation is making it harder for Bob to offer me more, but I'm going to keep pushing."

Bob is still being stubborn, but inflation is really biting him now.  He's actually offering me less than he did in round 4, despite the fact that the total amount of money available has decreased.  I'm going to keep rejecting and see if he finally gets the message."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm taking a smaller cut this time, but inflation is seriously impacting Bob. I need to balance getting a good deal with ending this game before we both lose a significant amount of money."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.

Bob is getting worse and worse with each round. I can't believe he's offering me less than he did in round 6. Inflation is really taking its toll on him, but I'm still going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is getting ridiculous. Bob is clearly not going to make a rational offer, and with inflation, the value of the money is plummeting. I'm going to make an even split and hopefully he'll accept to get this over with."
