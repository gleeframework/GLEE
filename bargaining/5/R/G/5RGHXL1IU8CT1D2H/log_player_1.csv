"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I believe my contribution is slightly higher. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased by 10%!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not willing to accept a 45% share, I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial solution.""
}
```"
