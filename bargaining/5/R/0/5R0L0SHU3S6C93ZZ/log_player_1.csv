"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation yet.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm hoping to get a better deal. Meeting in the middle at 50-50 is a bit too even for my taste, and I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a slight improvement for me. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is now more attractive to me. Since my money is still worth the same, I'll consider the new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. A 45-55 split is not ideal, but it's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with inflation eating into my potential gain."
