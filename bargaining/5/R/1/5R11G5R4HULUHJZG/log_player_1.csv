# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal.  We're both losing money by waiting.

# Bob gain: 40

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Waiting longer significantly diminishes returns for both of us.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob has rejected two offers that were more generous. He seems insistent on getting at least $40 (even though its real value is much lower).
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks getting a worse deal in later rounds, especially if Bob plays hardball. 

It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting a much smaller amount later."
