"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's try a more balanced split! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my share, I need to be more careful. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a split that gives me such a small share, especially with inflation reducing its value. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll on the money's value, so I need to be strategic. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance that accounts for the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a slightly better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking its toll! With the money's value decreasing so rapidly, I need to be even more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me such a small share, even if it's a slightly better deal than before. I'll try to hold out for a better offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money's value is decreasing rapidly, and I need to be strategic. Here's my next offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob. It's the fairest way to go.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that accounts for the decreasing value of the money and splits it fairly between us."
