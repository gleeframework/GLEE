"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair play, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since there's no inflation for me, I don't lose anything by waiting, but Alice does. Maybe she'll offer me more next time to avoid losing even more value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's slightly in my favor, but still reasonable. Since Alice loses value each round, she might be willing to accept a slightly worse deal to avoid losing even more.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but it's still a good deal for you.""}"
