"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good deal of money. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. This offer is a good compromise. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with the time limit and inflation. However, her offer is getting worse! It's essential I hold my ground, but I need to offer something slightly better to keep the negotiation moving."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to negotiate, but my previous offer was fair.  This is a compromise, and it ensures the deal gets done while the money is still valuable.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a solution right between our previous offers. This is a fair deal considering the time pressure.  Let's close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is getting closer to a more even split, but the time pressure is also working against me. I need to signal I'm willing to compromise but not at the cost of a significantly smaller share. Rejecting this keeps the pressure on her."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm meeting you halfway between our last two offers. This is a fair deal that reflects the time pressure we're both under. Let's close this and avoid further losses.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm sticking with this offer. It's a fair split considering the circumstances.  Let's be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting frustrated, which means my strategy of small concessions is working. She's also bluffing about sticking with her offer.  With the time pressure increasing, she'll be forced to move closer to a 50/50 split. I need to hold strong for one more round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and this back-and-forth is pointless. Let's end this now with a perfectly fair 50/50 split. This ensures we both walk away with a significant sum.""
