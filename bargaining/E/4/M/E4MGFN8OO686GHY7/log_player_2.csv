"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer accounts for the time value of money. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can do better!  It's worth holding out a few rounds to see what Alice is willing to offer as the value of the money decreases for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think we can both do better with a more even split. Let's see if we can come to an agreement that works for us both.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to see what happens in the next round, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and with the risk of getting nothing at all, it's best to take it."
