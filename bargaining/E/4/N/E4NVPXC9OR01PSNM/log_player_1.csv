"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can both walk away with a decent amount of money!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively fair split, considering the initial amount is $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth less, and I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer seems reasonable, and meeting halfway is a fair approach. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
