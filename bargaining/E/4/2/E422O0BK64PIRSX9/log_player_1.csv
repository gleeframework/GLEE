  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a fair share, and we can negotiate further if you don't like it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous 10% of the initial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, to be honest. I think I can do better than that.

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to wear me down with a series of slightly better offers. I'm not going to fall for it.

I'll keep waiting for a better offer. My patience is wearing thin, but I'm not ready to give in yet."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is finally willing to meet me at the 50/50 mark. I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept it, but it's getting late in the game.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 50/50 split. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than nothing, and it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping Bob will hold up his end of the bargain."
