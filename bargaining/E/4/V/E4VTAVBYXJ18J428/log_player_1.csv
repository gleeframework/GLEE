"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate. Bob's offer is a bit too generous for me, considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the increased inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
