"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer.  I want to see if Bob is risk-averse or if he's willing to play the long game.  If he rejects, I'll have to be a bit more reasonable in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair and I don't know how much the inflation will affect him in future rounds. It's better to accept now than risk losing more money."
