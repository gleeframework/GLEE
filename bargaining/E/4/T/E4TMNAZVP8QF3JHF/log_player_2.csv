**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is steadily decreasing for Alice, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on. 
* **Trend:** Alice has been slowly lowering her demand. She started at a 60/40 split in her favor and is now at 57/43.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer in hopes of a slightly better deal in the next round is risky. There's no guarantee Alice will offer more, and the longer we wait, the less appealing even a 50/50 split becomes for her.

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a much worse deal later or even reaching a stalemate where no agreement is reached."
