"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This means I'm offering to give Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gains.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000

This way, I'll keep more value for myself while still giving Bob a decent share."
