"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, the $400,000 I would gain is equivalent to $400,000 / 0.9 = $444,444.44 in Round 1 terms.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's still a decent proposal. I'll accept it for now.
