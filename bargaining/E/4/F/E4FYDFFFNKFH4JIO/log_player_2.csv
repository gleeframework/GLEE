Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While this offer is better than her last, it's still skewed in her favor, especially considering the faster rate of inflation impacting my potential gains.  I need to incentivize her to accept a deal sooner rather than later."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. This offer is a good compromise.""}"

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600

**Reasoning:** This is getting close, but the time pressure is on me more than Alice. I need to hold out for a slightly better deal to offset the rapid inflation impacting my potential share."
