"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more balanced. I propose a 55/45 split.  I'll take the larger share this time, but it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4,500 is worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round.

I'm not too happy with the 55/45 split, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is offering a larger share this time, I'll think it over...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer is worth 81% of what it would have been in the first round ($8,121).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly smaller share this time, but I think we can do better than 50/50. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
