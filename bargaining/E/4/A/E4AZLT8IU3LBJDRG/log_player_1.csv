"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent share""}

I'm proposing that I take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob takes 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and we can adjust as we go. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the split being 50/50, especially since it's not adjusted for inflation. I'd like to aim for a better deal. Let's keep negotiating!"

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want to be the majority shareholder. You can't expect to get 50% of the pie""}

I'm proposing that I take 60% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob takes 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than the last offer. Let's aim for a more equitable split. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the split being 55:45, but I'm also not willing to give up too much more. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away the majority. You're getting a decent chunk, but I'm still the majority shareholder""}

I'm proposing that I take 65% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob takes 35%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you the majority, but I need to see a significant increase in my share. If we can't find a compromise, we're both going to lose a lot of money. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer. While I would have liked to get a larger share, I'm concerned about the impact of inflation and the limited number of rounds we have left. Taking 60% of the remaining $1,000,000 and giving Bob 40% seems like a reasonable compromise at this point."
