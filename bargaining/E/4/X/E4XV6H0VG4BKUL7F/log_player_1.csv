Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 85,

I'm aiming high initially, but leaving some room for negotiation to make Bob feel like there's a benefit to compromising."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm offering you a fair deal that allows us both to benefit before inflation hurts my share any further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal. While I understand the impact of inflation on his potential gains, I'm not willing to accept such a low amount.  I'll counter with a stronger offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 70,
""bob_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is working against you. This is a fair offer, and it saves us both from further losses.""
}
``` 

Here's my reasoning:

* **Strong but Negotiable:**  I've lowered my demand from 85 to 70, showing willingness to compromise. But it's still heavily in my favor.
* **Highlighting Inflation:** I'm reminding Bob of the time pressure and how it negatively impacts him more than me. 
* **Urgency:**  I want to encourage Bob to settle sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or we're both going to lose out.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a tough one! While the pressure is on, Bob is bluffing with the ""final offer"" tactic. There's no way he'll accept less than me if the game goes to round 5. I'm willing to gamble that he'll be more open to a more significant compromise in the next round as the inflation really starts to bite into his potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, last chance. This is my final offer.  You're losing ground fast with each round. Let's be smart and take this win-win.""
}
``` 

Here's my strategy:

* **Finality:** I'm mirroring Bob's ""final offer"" language to create a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Slight Concession:** I've come down slightly from 70 to 65, demonstrating a willingness to compromise (even if it's small). 
* **Focus on Shared Benefit:** I'm emphasizing the ""win-win"" aspect, reminding Bob that accepting now is better than dragging it out and losing more to inflation.

By now, Bob should clearly see the trend and understand that I'm not going to accept anything below 60. This offer is designed to be the tipping point where he'll choose a guaranteed, albeit smaller, gain over the risk of losing even more."
