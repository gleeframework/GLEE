"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, but with a slight bias in my favor. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be a bit more realistic. This offer won't be as good next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, as I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, and I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is as generous as he claims. The inflation isn't too bad for me yet, so I'll take the risk and see what happens next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer to divide the $10,000 and a message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but don't wait too long""
}
```

I'm offering to take $5,800 and give Bob $4,200, which is a slightly more even split than my initial offer, but still in my favor. I'm also hinting to Bob that he shouldn't wait too long to accept, as the inflation will keep reducing the value of the money. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the significant inflation that has occurred, I think Bob's offer is relatively reasonable, and I'm not confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. Additionally, Bob claims that this is his final offer, so I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'll accept this offer and take the $4,800, which is still a decent amount despite the inflation."
