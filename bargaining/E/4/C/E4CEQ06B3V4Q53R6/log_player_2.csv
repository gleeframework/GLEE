Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

```

**Reasoning:**

It's getting down to the wire. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice given the circumstances:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The 34.39% inflation has significantly eroded Bob's potential gains. Waiting longer will only worsen the situation. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  Alice seems content with a 57/43 split.  She might not budge much further, and there's a risk she'll offer even less in the next round.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Holding out for a marginally better deal in the final round is extremely risky. If Bob rejects this offer, he's likely to get a worse deal, or nothing at all. 
 
While not a great outcome for Bob, accepting a 43/57 split at this stage cuts his losses and prevents a worse outcome."
