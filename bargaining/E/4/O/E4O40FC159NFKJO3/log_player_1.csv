"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a decent share, let's settle this early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%. The message is a friendly one, hoping to persuade Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not impressed with the first offer, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less after the first round, my gain of 700,000 is actually worth 560,000 in real value.

I'm not too thrilled with this offer, but it's a decent compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer."
