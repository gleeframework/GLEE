"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $600,000 and you'll get $400,000. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively modest amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with Bob taking a 70% share, even with the reduced value of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate further and see if we can find a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll take $420,000 and you'll get $580,000. Let's try to end this!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and giving Bob a significant share."
