"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I get a slight advantage. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 60% of the remaining money, even if it's worth less due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55/45""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount of money and not giving up too much to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth significantly less now. I'll have to be more cautious with my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, as the money is worth less and less with each round, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value."
