I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  It's a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure how much longer this game will go on, and the value of my potential gains is shrinking with each round.  It's a fair split, and I'm not going to risk losing even more."
