"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm willing to give you a decent chunk to get us moving.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This way, we can both get something and have a good starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money being worth 10% less, I'm now considering a gain of $5,000 to be equivalent to $9,000 in the first round. That's a significant decrease.

However, I'm not sure if Bob is considering the inflation effect on his gain as well. If he's not, he might be getting a better deal than I am.

I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Time to be realistic, Bob. We need to move quickly and get a good share for myself.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. This way, I'm trying to get a larger share while still leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now.

Let's calculate the equivalent values in Round 1 terms:

* My gain of $4,000 in Round 4 is equivalent to approximately $5,544 in Round 1 terms.
* Bob's gain of $6,000 in Round 4 is equivalent to approximately $7,692 in Round 1 terms.

Considering the equivalent values, Bob's offer is actually a relatively good one for me, especially since I'm getting a larger share than in my previous offer. However, I'm not sure if Bob is considering the inflation effect on his gain as well.

I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.
