"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. I propose 60$ for you and 40$ for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though it's a fair split right now, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Since the money is worth less in each round, I want to see if I can negotiate a better share for myself before the value drops too much."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think we can both benefit from getting this done sooner.  Let's split it 65/35 in my favor.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's adjust our shares accordingly. I propose 55$ for you and 45$ for me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is still favorable to me, even with the inflation factor. It's better to accept this offer than to risk a further decline in the value of my potential gains."
