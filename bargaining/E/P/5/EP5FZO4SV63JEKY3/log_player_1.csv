"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since Bob's money is worth less than mine with each round, this should be a good deal for him.  It also leaves room for me to adjust my offer in the next round if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While my gains are reduced, Bob's gains are reduced by a much higher percentage. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose a 70/30 split.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, it shows he's looking for a bigger share. I'm willing to give him a larger portion this round to ensure a deal, but I'm still aiming for a majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer. While my gains are significantly reduced due to inflation, Bob's gains are even more dramatically reduced. At this point, accepting a 40/60 split is the best option to secure any share of the money before it dwindles further."
