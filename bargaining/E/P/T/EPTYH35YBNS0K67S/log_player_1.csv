"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $100, and we can reassess our strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to increase it if you accept 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I need to be careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it for now. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to accept a 60/40 split just yet. I'd like to see a more balanced proposal.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm hoping we can find a more balanced split later.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a firmer stance this round, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think carefully before making a decision. With my gain worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be more cautious. However, I'm not ready to accept a 70/30 split just yet.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 70/30 split, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try 50/50 again.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll make a new proposal for Round 5. With inflation, my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate.

However, I'm not sure if I can afford to be too aggressive, considering the inflation rate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to balance my needs with the inflation rate. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split.""
}
```"
