Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  I believe this is a fair starting point, as I'm willing to share a significant portion of the money.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than nothing. We're already losing money due to inflation, and rejecting this offer could lead to a worse outcome in the next round."
