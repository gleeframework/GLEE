"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving Bob with $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

My gain would be 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000, and Bob's gain would be 700,000 * 0.9 = 630,000.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

I'm offering to take 45% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $450,000, and leaving Bob with $550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll calculate my gain as follows:

Original gain: 500,000
Discount: 27.1% of 500,000 = 135,500
Adjusted gain: 500,000 - 135,500 = 364,500

I'll accept Bob's offer.
