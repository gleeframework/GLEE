"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a fairly standard 70-30 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced my gain's value, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
```"
