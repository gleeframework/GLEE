I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 700,000 for me and 300,000 for Bob. This is a fair compromise given the inflation and Bob's previous offer.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

This is a much better offer for me, especially with the increased inflation. I'll take it!"
