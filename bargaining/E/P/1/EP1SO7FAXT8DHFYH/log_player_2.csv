"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob. Take this and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice is offering a lot, it's worth considering that in the next round, Bob gets to make the offer.  Since there's inflation, the money will be worth less in the next round, so it's worth holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 900000,
""alice_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""I'm sure you understand that I'm taking a bigger share this time, but I'm willing to negotiate further. Let's get this done quickly before the money depreciates too much.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. This is a fair split given the inflation.  I'm willing to work with you, but we need to agree now before things get even worse. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While it's tempting to keep rejecting and hoping for a better deal,  the inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money.  Accepting this offer ensures a large gain for Bob, even with the inflation, and avoids further risk of losing even more money."
