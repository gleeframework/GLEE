"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, and I'm getting $40, that's equivalent to $38 in the previous round's value.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a better deal for me than my original 50-50 split.
