Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'final offer' wasn't good enough, try again or walk away 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While my options are getting worse, accepting this offer would mean I lose a significant portion of the initial potential gain. It's a risk, but I'm hoping she'll be more open to a fairer deal in the next round as the game could end with her getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""It seems we're approaching a stalemate. This is a compromise to avoid us both losing out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and the value of my potential gains is diminishing rapidly. Alice seems determined to push for a larger share, but she risks getting nothing if the game continues. This offer is a slight concession on my part, but it presents a final chance for a reasonable agreement before the effects of inflation make further negotiation pointless."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, the money is losing value fast for you 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but unfortunately, time is no longer on my side.  Alice is ruthlessly exploiting the impact of inflation on my potential gains. If I reject this offer and she continues her current strategy, the next offer is likely to be even worse. Accepting this offer cuts my losses and ensures I receive something, which is better than the increasingly likely outcome of walking away with nothing."
