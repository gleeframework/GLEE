Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing money with every round. I'm meeting you halfway between our previous offers. Let's be sensible. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a small hit to meet you closer to the middle ground AGAIN. Take it or leave it - we're both losing serious money here. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but the inflation is starting to become very significant for Bob. Accepting a 375,000 share now is better than risking getting a much smaller amount later, or even nothing if the negotiations fail."
