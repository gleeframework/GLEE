**Reasoning:** Bob is taking advantage of the faster rate of inflation on his end. While he is making small concessions, the difference between our offers is shrinking in his favor due to the rapid devaluation of his potential gains.  I need to hold firm to signal I won't be swayed by this tactic and push for a more equitable split before inflation eats into my share too much."
