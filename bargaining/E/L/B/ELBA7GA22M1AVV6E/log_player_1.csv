"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to get a bit more for himself, but I'm not going to give in that easily.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With inflation kicking in, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a bigger share.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, hoping Bob will take it or leave it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, but the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take the 40% and hope it's enough to get me a decent share of the money."
