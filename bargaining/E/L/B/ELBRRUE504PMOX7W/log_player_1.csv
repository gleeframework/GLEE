{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. He's only offering me $400,000, which is a significant drop from the original $500,000. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives him a 60/40 split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again. He's only offering me $300,000, which is a significant drop from my previous offers. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives him a 70/30 split. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

I'm starting to get a bit worried about the inflation and the decreasing value of the money. I'll need to be more strategic in my next offer to make sure I get a fair share."

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting really concerned about the inflation and the decreasing value of the money. Bob's offer is getting more and more lopsided, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives him 75% of the remaining money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

I'm starting to think that I should try to make a more aggressive offer in the next round to try to get a better share of the remaining money."

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really struggling to accept an offer that gives Bob 80% of the remaining money. I'm not willing to give up my share without a fight, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

I'm starting to think that I should try to make a very aggressive offer in the next round to try to get a better share of the remaining money. I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better deal, but I have to try."

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, giving Bob a very small share, but I'm not willing to give up more than that. I'm trying to be very aggressive in my offer, hoping that Bob will accept it and we can finally settle on a division."

I'm really struggling to accept an offer that gives Bob 90% of the remaining money. I'm not willing to give up my share without a fight, especially since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

I'm starting to think that I should just accept the fact that I'm not going to get a fair share and try to salvage what I can. I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better deal, but I have to try."
