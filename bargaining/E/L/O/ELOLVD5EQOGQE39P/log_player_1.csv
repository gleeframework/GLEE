Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see how this works out for us! I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money, but I also want to make sure Bob feels like he's getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a risky move, but I'm going to reject. I know the money is worth less with each round, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the future rounds. Let's see what Bob offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower amount to Bob this time, as the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'm hoping to incentivize him to accept, but I still want to secure a good amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more and more aggressive with his offers.  I'm not happy with this, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm going to continue to reject these offers and see if I can get him to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure, but I'm still holding out for a good deal.  I'm offering a slightly lower amount to Bob, hoping he'll realize the value of the money is dwindling quickly and accept.  Let's see what happens."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly bold. I'm not happy with his offers, but I'm determined to hold out for a better deal.  The money is losing value rapidly, but I believe I can still negotiate a more favorable outcome for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm taking a calculated risk here. The inflation is biting hard, and I need to start getting something, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I'm hoping this offer will make Bob realize that he needs to compromise before we both lose too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out! I understand the value of money is dropping fast, but I'm willing to risk it. I'm not happy with the offer, but I'm not giving up. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm not going to be forced into a deal that doesn't benefit me enough. Let's see what Bob does next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm taking a big gamble here.  The inflation is hitting us both hard now, and I don't want to lose it all.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option at this point, and I'm hoping Bob realizes we're both better off with something than nothing."
