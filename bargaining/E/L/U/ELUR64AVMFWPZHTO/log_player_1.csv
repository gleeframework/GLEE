Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 58% and Alice can have 42%. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800

``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation is starting to hurt and Bob's offer is still relatively fair. It's better to take what I can get now before the value drops even further."
