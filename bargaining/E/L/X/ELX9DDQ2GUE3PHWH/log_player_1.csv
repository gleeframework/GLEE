"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI propose that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. This is a reasonable offer, considering that the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round. I've attached a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to convey that this is a fair and reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the diminishing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less to Bob, his proposed split of $550,000 for himself and $450,000 for me is still not favorable to me, considering that the money is worth the same to me as in the first round. I'll proceed to the next round to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation!""}\n\nI propose that I receive $650,000 and Bob receives $350,000. Given that the money is worth 20% less to Bob with each passing round, I believe this offer is more reasonable. I've attached a message saying ""Consider the inflation!"" to remind Bob of the diminishing value of the money to him."
