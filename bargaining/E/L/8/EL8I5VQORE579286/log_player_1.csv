"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This is a relatively generous offer, considering that the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer. Considering that the money is worth 10% less for Bob, this offer is actually quite fair. I'll accept this offer.
