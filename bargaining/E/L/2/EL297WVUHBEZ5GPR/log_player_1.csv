I'm taking a very greedy approach in the first round. I'm offering Bob the bare minimum, hoping he'll be desperate enough to accept.  I'll adjust my strategy depending on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would love to get more money, the inflation is a real threat.  Bob is taking a significant chunk, but it's better to get 800,000 now than risk getting nothing later on."
