Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll think it's a good starting point and accept."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth less than I initially thought. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about the huge disparity in our shares. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

  ""message"": ""Time to meet in the middle, Bob!""
