"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm not giving up control completely! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I suppose it's better than nothing. I'll have to think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Maybe I can squeeze out a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The pressure is on! Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but don't think I'm going soft!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, I'm calling the shots now! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of the money is plummeting! I'm not thrilled about the 75/25 split, but I'm not sure I have much leverage left. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further, but I'm getting a bit desperate..."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is dropping fast! I'll have to think carefully about my next move. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet! Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it. The value of the money is worth a lot less now, and I don't want to end up with nothing!"
