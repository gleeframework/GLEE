Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, accepting an offer where I get significantly less than Alice isn't ideal.  We're past the halfway point, and the pressure is on Alice to make a deal before we both lose everything.  I need to hold firm to get a better offer."
