"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 10 more dollars, but I want to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer for now.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken a bigger bite, and my potential gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90%). I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Your turn!""
