"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give it all away.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. You can do better than that, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal, while still keeping a significant portion of the money for myself."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500

I'm holding out for a better deal, but I know I need to be careful not to wait too long. The money is slipping away!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I'm not giving in completely. You can do better than that, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a bit more for myself, but I know I'm running out of time."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value fast! I need to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll accept Bob's offer from round 6.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a 50-50 split, which is as good as it's going to get at this point. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round, and the money is worth less and less with each passing round."
