"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $5,000 and take $5,000 for myself. It's a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid wasting time."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering the offer, I'll have to calculate the actual value of the money I'll receive, taking into account the 20% decrease in value.

Alice gain: 4000 -> 3200 (due to 20% decrease)
Bob gain: 6000 -> 6000 (no change)

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.
