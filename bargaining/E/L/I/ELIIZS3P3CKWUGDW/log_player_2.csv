"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, I'll make a counteroffer. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I'd gain are:

* Round 1: $40
* Round 2: $40 * 0.9 = $36
* Round 3: $36 * 0.9075 = $32.73

Alice's offer is $60, which is equivalent to $60 * 0.9 * 0.9075 = $51.45 in the original amount.

I'll accept this offer.
