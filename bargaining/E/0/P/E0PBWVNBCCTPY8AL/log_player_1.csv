"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and give Bob 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 20 dollars is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 80 dollars is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer. My gain of 20 dollars is not enough for me, considering the value of money is decreasing. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so the total value of the money is now 90% of what it was in round 2.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}

I'm offering to take 40 dollars and give Bob 60 dollars."
