"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
Explanation: While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is losing value quickly. Waiting longer means getting even less.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is unlikely to offer more than this. She knows time is on her side with inflation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks getting even less in future rounds if Alice proposes a worse deal.

Getting $43 now is better than potentially getting less later.
