"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we can discuss further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55% is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now.

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 55% is a fair split for me, and I'm hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's split it 55.5% to me and 44.5% to you.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm still pushing for a slightly higher percentage for myself."
