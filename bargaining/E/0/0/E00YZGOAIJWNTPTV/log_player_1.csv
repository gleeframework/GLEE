"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. Since the money loses value for Bob with each passing round, I'll try to negotiate a deal that benefits me more. I'll attach a message saying ""Let's be reasonable"" to convey that I'm open to negotiations but also want to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer to split the money evenly. Since the money doesn't lose value for me with each passing round, I can try to hold out for a better deal. Additionally, Bob's offer of an even split doesn't take into account the fact that the money is worth 20% less to him in this round, so I may be able to negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $360,000, which is 20% less than the $450,000 I would have offered if the money hadn't lost value for him. I'll keep $640,000 for myself. I'll attach a message saying ""Consider the inflation"" to remind Bob that the money is losing value for him with each passing round.\n{""alice_gain"": 640000, ""bob_gain"": 360000, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer of $550,000 for myself and $450,000 for him. Although the money doesn't lose value for me, Bob's offer is relatively close to my previous offer, and considering he says it's his final offer, I don't want to risk him walking away or the game ending without a deal. Additionally, I've already gotten a significant share of the money, and accepting this offer ensures I get at least $550,000.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
