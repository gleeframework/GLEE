"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $90 and Bob receiving $10. This seems like a fair starting point, given that I'm taking the risk of being rejected and potentially losing a chance to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more favorable split, accepting a 50/50 offer in round 2 is a good strategy. It ensures that I get something and avoids the risk of further inflation and potential rejection in future rounds."
