"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure why Bob is proposing an equal split, considering he rejected my initial offer. I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve more""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 500, while decreasing Bob's share by 500. Let's see if this will be more acceptable to him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! The money is worth significantly less now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to give me a good deal, considering he rejected my previous offers. I think I can do better than this. I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slight edge""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still pushing for a slightly better deal for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
