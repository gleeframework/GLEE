600000.0,400000.0,I propose dividing the money in a 3:2 ratio. This ensures a fair share while also considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I propose a 6:4 split. Since we're both losing money with each round, I believe this division is more beneficial for both of us in the long run.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
500000.0,500000.0,I propose an equal division of the remaining funds. This maintains fairness and ensures that both of us receive an equivalent share despite the diminishing value of money in each subsequent round.,Alice,3,
