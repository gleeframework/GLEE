"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I need to consider the offer in terms of the original value.

My gain of $300,000 is worth 90% of the original $600,000 I offered in the first round, which is $540,000.

Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 90% of the original $1,000,000, which is $630,000.

I think this is a good deal for me, so I'll accept.
