"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, seems fair""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, where I get 70 dollars and Bob gets 30 dollars. The message is a friendly suggestion to Bob to accept this split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 80:20 is a more generous offer 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective value of the money is decreasing, so I'd better not be too greedy.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
