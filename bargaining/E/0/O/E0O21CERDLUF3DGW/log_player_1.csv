"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable division""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable division, considering we're starting with a large sum of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the inflation rates 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 40-60 split in favor of Bob. I think I should get a better share considering I'm also affected by the inflation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise on a 55-45 split, considering the reduced value of the money""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the effects of inflation."
