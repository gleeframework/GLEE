This is a tough one, but I need to cut my losses. Here's why:

* **Inflation is killing me:**  The value of the deal for me is shrinking rapidly with each round. 
* **Alice is unlikely to budge much:** She's consistently aimed for a larger share and time is on her side.
* **Something is better than nothing:** If I reject this, there's a chance I'll be forced to accept an even worse offer in a future round, or end up with nothing if we can't agree."
