"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, giving Bob a 40% share of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a 56% share of the initial $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. I'll have to think carefully...

I decide to reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was already quite high, I'll try to get an even better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly lower share than in round 2, but still a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze Bob's new offer. Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a 54.4% share of the initial $1,000,000, which is even higher than his offer in round 2.

I'll have to think carefully about this...

After considering the inflation effect, I decide to accept Bob's offer.
