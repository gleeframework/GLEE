"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. I'll take a slightly larger portion this round, but it's a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 10%. I'm framing it as a ""fair share"" to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this round, but I'll give you a small chance to get a better deal later. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I'd get is $1800 (20% of $9000).

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, as I'd be getting a significantly smaller share of the money. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less after two rounds, the current effective amount is 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this round to give you a chance to get a better deal. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
