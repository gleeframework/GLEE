"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we split the money 60/40. This is a fair offer considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing we split the money 60/40, but in my favor this time. While inflation hurts us both, it hits you harder, so let's be fair to each other.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about a 55/45 split? It accounts for the inflation but is still a decent deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal. I know the inflation is hitting us both hard, but I'm willing to wait and see if we can find a more favorable split."

Round 4
