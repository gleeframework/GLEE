"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 80/20, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but with a slightly higher value for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 25, ""alice_gain"": 75}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer is still a 70/30 split, which is similar to her previous offer, and considering that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
