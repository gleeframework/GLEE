"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! I propose we split the money evenly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. With 20% inflation, I'm willing to take a risk to potentially get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I want to try to get a bit more than half to compensate for the loss. Let's see if Alice will accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need to make sure I get a fair share. Let's split it 45/55. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer is slightly better than the initial one, considering the 36% decrease in value for me, I think I can still try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, I need a better split to make up for it""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gain, I'm going to propose a more favorable split for myself. Hopefully, Alice will understand the pressure the inflation is putting on my end and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I still need a decent share. Let's split it 40/60, and at least we'll both get something. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, and given that we're already halfway through the rounds, I think accepting this offer is the most reasonable decision. The difference in our gains due to inflation is substantial, and there's a risk that if we continue, the value might drop to a point where it's not worth the gamble. Accepting now ensures we both get something, and 60% seems like a fair compromise under the circumstances."
