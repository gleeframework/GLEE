"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's tempting to accept a 50/50 split, but knowing about the inflation makes me want to see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split.  Let's try 60/40, with me getting the larger share this round.  I'm willing to negotiate in the next round if you reject this offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal this time. Let's see if you'll accept it! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less to me due to inflation, I'm accepting this offer. I know if I reject, the next round will give Alice more leverage.  While it would be nice to get more money, this offer is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate."
