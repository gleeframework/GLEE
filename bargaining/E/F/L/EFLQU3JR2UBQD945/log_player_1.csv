Bob's offer is getting worse! I need to hold out for a better deal."

This is getting ridiculous! Bob is clearly trying to exploit the inflation.  I need to hold strong, even though the value is decreasing quickly."

This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  The value of the money is decreasing so rapidly that if I reject this offer, I'll be left with even less in the next round. Bob knows this and is clearly exploiting the situation.  It's frustrating, but better to take the sure thing now."
