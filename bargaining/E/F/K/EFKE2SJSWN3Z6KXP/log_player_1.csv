{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I would get $60 and Bob would get $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: You're right, fair is a good start. But I think I can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I want to accept this offer. While it's a 50-50 split, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I think this split is a good middle ground.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, where I would get $55 and Bob would get $45. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and being willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I like this middle ground, but I'm willing to meet you halfway... for now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less than before, I'm trying to be more flexible. However, I'm not sure if I can accept this offer without trying to negotiate a bit more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, just like you said. Let's split it 50-50.""}

I'm proposing an equal split, where we both get $50. I'm trying to be more flexible and willing to compromise, considering the reduced value of the money."
