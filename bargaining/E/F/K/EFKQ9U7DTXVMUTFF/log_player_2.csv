Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm proposing a compromise that acknowledges the time pressure from inflation while still being beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is moving in the right direction, it's crucial to remember that inflation is hurting her much more than it's hurting me.  She's feeling the pressure to make a deal, and I can leverage that in the next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. A straight 50/50 split is the only fair solution at this point. Let's end this negotiation before inflation hurts us both even more. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 7 rounds remaining, the pressure is on. Inflation is rapidly eroding the value, and the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing significantly.

* **Fair Deal:**  A 50/50 split, while not ideal at this stage, is a fair and reasonable outcome.  

* **Alice's Position:** Her ""final offer"" language suggests she might be unwilling to negotiate further. Rejecting this offer could lead to more aggressive offers from her, ultimately putting me in a worse position. 

It's time to be pragmatic and secure a reasonable share before inflation eats away at the entire pie."
