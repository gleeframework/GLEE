Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but let's be realistic. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This leaves you with a decent sum considering the inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a compromise. I'm willing to take 40% this time, but we need to reach a deal before inflation eats away at our gains. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
