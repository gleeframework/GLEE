"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but let's be realistic. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This leaves you with a decent sum considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
