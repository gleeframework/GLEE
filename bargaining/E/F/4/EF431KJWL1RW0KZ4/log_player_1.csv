"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 5500/4500 split in your favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, and gives you a slight advantage.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This offer is fair and gives me a good return considering the inflation.  Let's end this game!"
