"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both get a good amount this way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of the original amount, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'm not thrilled about accepting a 50/50 split, as I'd rather have more money than Bob. However, it's a relatively fair offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
