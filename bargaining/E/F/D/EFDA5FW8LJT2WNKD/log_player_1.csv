Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. We can adjust as needed in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Bob, I need a bit more than that to agree. This offer accounts for the value decrease while still leaving you with a decent amount.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up a bit, but I still think a more even split is fair. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob is moving closer to a more even split, the inflation is heavily impacting the value of Alice's potential winnings. It's still beneficial for Alice to hold out for a better offer, at least for another round or two."

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 6300,

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value is decreasing, but I'm still not comfortable with such a large disparity. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but this is my final offer before the money becomes even less valuable. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is severely cutting into Alice's potential gains. While Bob's offer is still not ideal, it's better to accept a less favorable offer than risk the money losing even more value, or worse, getting nothing at all if they run out of rounds.  Bob has also indicated this is his final offer in this range, suggesting he might be less generous in future rounds."
