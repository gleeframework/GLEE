"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I believe this is a fair reflection of the value of my time and effort. However, I am willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
