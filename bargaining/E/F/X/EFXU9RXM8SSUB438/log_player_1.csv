Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Inflation is hurting you more, I think I deserve a bit more

# Bob gain: 58

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking advantage of my higher inflation rate, but I still have some leverage. Accepting 42% now would mean I lose almost 60% of the original value due to inflation. It's a bad deal, and I'm willing to gamble on one more round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Bob.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day before we both lose out even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Every round sees significant inflation eating away at the total value. A 50/50 split now is better than a potentially worse deal later. 
* **Anchoring:** By consistently offering deals where I get a slight advantage, I've hopefully anchored Bob's expectations. He might be more willing to accept a 50/50 split now that it seems like a loss for me compared to my previous offers. 
* **Simplicity:**  A 50/50 split is the easiest to agree on. It avoids further complex calculations and potential disagreements about fairness."
