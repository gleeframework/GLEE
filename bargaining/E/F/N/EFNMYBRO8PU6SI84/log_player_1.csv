Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed. Let's aim for something more reasonable.  I'm proposing a 60/40 split in your favor. This ensures you get a good deal, and I receive something worthwhile before inflation eats into it. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
