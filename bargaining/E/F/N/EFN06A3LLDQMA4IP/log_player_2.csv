"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share but you'll get something too! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting at first glance, the inflation makes it risky to accept.  Bob gains a significant amount, but it's unclear how much Alice's ""something too"" will be worth in the next round. It's best to see if Alice will offer a better deal when the money is worth less for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, 60/40.  This way we both get a fair share before inflation hits too hard.""}
