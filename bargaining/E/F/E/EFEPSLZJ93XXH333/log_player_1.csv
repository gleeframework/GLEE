"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll still let you keep a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the offer, I'd rather not take the smaller share, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to make a counteroffer. How about 400000 for me and 600000 for you?""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"

```

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent amount for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a bigger share and keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not giving up much. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the small share I'd get, but I don't want to give up either. I'll think carefully...

After weighing the options, I decide to reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about 320000 for me and 680000 for you?""
}
```

Let's see if I can negotiate a better deal!"

  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
  ""bob_gain"": 620000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but still keep a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really low-balling me now, I'll give you a tiny share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really hurting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the tiny share I'd get, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation.

After careful consideration, I decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I guess I'll take the smaller share, but I'm hoping it's better than the alternative - losing even more value!"
