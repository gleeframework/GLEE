"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

I'm not thrilled about accepting an offer that gives me less than I proposed initially, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
