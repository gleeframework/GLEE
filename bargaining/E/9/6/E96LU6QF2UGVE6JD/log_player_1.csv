"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less to begin with.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, with the message that I'm starting with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more this time, but still keeping things mostly fair. Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I would gain and Bob would gain are:

My gain: $4,000 (worth 90% of $4,400)
Bob's gain: $5,400 (worth 95% of $5,684)

I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but it's still a decent split. I'll accept this offer.
