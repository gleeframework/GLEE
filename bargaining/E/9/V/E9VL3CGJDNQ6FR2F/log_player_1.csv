"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

I'll reject this offer, as I think I'm getting a relatively small share compared to the initial offer I made. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round. I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the time running out.
