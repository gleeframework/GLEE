"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40, you can try to do better next round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a fair share, and I'm hoping he'll try to do better next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but you can still do better 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $70 is worth 95% of the original $60 I offered in the first round, which is $57. My gain is slightly less than the original offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 25% of its original value now (95% of 95% = 90.25%). I'll aim to get a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You can do better than this, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

Original $100, after 3 rounds of inflation, is worth 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.8575 = 0.7895 or 78.95% of the original value.
My gain of $75 is worth 75 / 0.7895 = 94.93% of the original $60 I offered in the first round, which is approximately $56.96.

This offer is better than my previous one, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll accept this offer.
