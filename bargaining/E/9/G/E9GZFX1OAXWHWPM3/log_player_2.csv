"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get the rest. We can negotiate if you want, but I'm sure you can find better ways to spend $1000 than I can find to spend $9000. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
It's better to try and negotiate a better deal. I'll see if I can get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer.  Let's both get a decent share."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking 60% and you getting 40%. I think this is fair considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the inflation hit my share hard, getting 4000 is better than getting nothing."
