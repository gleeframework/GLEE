"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, but I still want to maximize my gain.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 20% of the remaining money. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 25% less than in the first round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's meet closer to the middle this time!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, while still trying to get a decent amount for myself. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
