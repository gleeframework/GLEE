Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split in your favor.  It's a fair compromise that allows us to avoid further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
