520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, my offer is getting worse with the inflation. This is a 52/48 split, you get more than last time. Let's settle this before it gets worse for me.",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, time is ticking and your offers aren't getting any more appealing.  I'll come down slightly to 58/42. Take it before inflation eats away even more of your potential winnings.",Bob,4,
