Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but her offer is still not favorable. While she's losing value faster, accepting now would lock me in at a significant disadvantage. I need to hold out for a better deal, knowing that the pressure will only mount on Alice."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome. Don't let greed make us both lose!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming critical for both sides.  While holding out *might* yield a slightly better result, the risk of getting nothing is escalating rapidly. Offering a 50/50 split is now the most logical play. It: 

* **Appeals to reason:** Alice can clearly see the situation, and the fairness of the offer is undeniable. 
* **Applies pressure:**  The ""don't be greedy"" message emphasizes the potential for mutual loss, making her hesitate to reject it. 
* **Protects my interests:** Accepting anything less at this stage would be significantly impacted by the inflation, even if she agreed."
