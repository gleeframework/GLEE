"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4,000 and keep $6,000 for myself. My message to Bob is ""Let's split fairly"". I believe this is a reasonable offer, considering we both want to get something out of this deal. I'm willing to give Bob a significant share, but I also want to make sure I get a bit more since I'm making the first offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we have limited time.  Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI don't think Bob's offer is fair. He's giving himself $5,500, which is more than half of the original amount, and only offering me $4,500. Considering the money is worth 10% less now, I think I can get a better deal if I wait. I'll reject his offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $4,200 and keep $5,800 for myself. My message to Bob is ""Let's find a middle ground"". Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'm willing to give Bob a bit less than before, but still want to make sure I get a reasonable share. I hope Bob will consider this offer and we can come to an agreement. \n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think an even split is the fairest solution.  Let's end this now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Bob's offer is reasonable, considering the money is worth 27.1% less now. An even split of $5,000 each is a fair solution, and it's better to end the game now and avoid further losses due to inflation. I'll accept his offer.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIs the game over?
