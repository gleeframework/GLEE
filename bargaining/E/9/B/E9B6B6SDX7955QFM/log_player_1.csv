"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep 900,000$ for myself and give 100,000$ to Bob.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation we need to account for.  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share,  accepting this offer ensures that I receive something. The inflation will only decrease my share further in the next round, making this the most advantageous option for me."
