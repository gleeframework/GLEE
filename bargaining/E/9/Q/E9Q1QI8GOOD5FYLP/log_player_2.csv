Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is decreasing rapidly. My offer is 57/43 - it's a good deal considering the circumstances, and waiting any longer only hurts us both. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700
