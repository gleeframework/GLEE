"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split it 60/40, since I'm taking a bigger risk of inflation. Let's see how you feel about that. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to be more cautious.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll propose a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation.""}"
