"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $60 gain from Round 1 is now worth $48, and Bob's $40 gain is now worth $38.

Considering Bob's offer for Round 2, I'd like to reject it since I can get a better deal than a 50-50 split.
