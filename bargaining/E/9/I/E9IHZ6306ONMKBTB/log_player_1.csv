"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 8000 and Bob receives 2000. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're just starting out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'm willing to negotiate.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think meeting in the middle is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to take the 4000. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than going to the next round and risking further erosion of my potential gain."
