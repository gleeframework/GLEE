"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you can have a decent chunk too! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of the original, so $8,000 is now worth $6,400.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll take a closer look:

* I would get $4,000, which is worth $3,200 after inflation.
* Bob would get $6,000, which is the same as before.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with taking only $3,200, considering the initial offer was $8,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With another round of inflation, my potential gain is now worth 64% of the original, so $8,000 is now worth $5,120.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and share the burden of inflation!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but you'll still get a decent share! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With another round of inflation, my potential gain is now worth 51.2% of the original, so $8,000 is now worth $4,096.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll take a look:

* I would get $3,000, which is worth $1,545.60 after inflation.
* Bob would get $7,000, which is the same as before.

I'm not thrilled about taking only $1,545.60, especially considering the initial offer was $8,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With another round of inflation, my potential gain is now worth 40.96% of the original, so $8,000 is now worth $3,276.80.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need to think about my own share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly weighted split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
