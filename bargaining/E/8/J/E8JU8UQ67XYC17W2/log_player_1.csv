"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\nI'll start by offering a division that seems reasonably fair but slightly in my favor, considering the inflation rates. Since the money loses value faster for Bob, I'll try to use this to my advantage without being too aggressive, to encourage acceptance rather than risking further devaluation for both of us.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Fair start considering inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both lose value with each round, so fairness seems like the best approach. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\nConsidering Bob's offer and the impact of inflation, an even split might seem fair at first glance. However, given that the money loses value at different rates for us (10% for me vs. 20% for Bob), I believe I can negotiate a slightly better deal in the next rounds, leveraging the higher devaluation of Bob's share as a bargaining chip.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 3\nGiven the rejection and the ongoing inflation, I'll adjust my offer slightly to make it more appealing to Bob while still aiming for a favorable split. Since Bob loses value faster, I'll try to find a balance that acknowledges this without giving away too much.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust for mutual benefit.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
