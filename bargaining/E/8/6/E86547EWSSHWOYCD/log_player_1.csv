I'm starting with a high offer for myself, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly. I'm aware of the inflation but I'm hoping it won't be too significant in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round. It's better to secure at least something than risk getting nothing."
