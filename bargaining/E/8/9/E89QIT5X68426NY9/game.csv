7000.0,3000.0,I propose dividing the money 7000$ for me and 3000$ for you. This seems fair considering the risk of inflation.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think a 5500/4500 split is a fairer reflection of the potential for inflation. This allows for a more balanced outcome for both of us.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
