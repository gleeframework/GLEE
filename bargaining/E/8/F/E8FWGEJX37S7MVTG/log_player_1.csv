"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the decrease in value, let's split it 3:1. I'll take 600,000 and you'll receive 400,000. This maintains some fairness while accounting for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
