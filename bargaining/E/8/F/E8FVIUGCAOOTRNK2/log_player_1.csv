"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can take 20%.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $7,000 is worth 10% less than my initial gain of $8,000, which is $7,200.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll consider it. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than mine, but I'm still not sure if I should settle for this amount.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, my gain is worth 10% less than in Round 2, which is 10% of $7,200 = $720. So, my gain is $7,200 - $720 = $6,480.

Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time. Will you accept?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up yet. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, my gain of $6,480 is worth 27.1% less than my initial gain of $8,000, which is $6,480 - ($8,000 x 0.271) = $6,480 - $2,168 = $4,312.

I'll consider Bob's offer. My gain of $5,500 is worth 31.25% less than my gain in Round 2, which is $5,500 - ($7,200 x 0.3125) = $5,500 - $2,250 = $3,250.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
