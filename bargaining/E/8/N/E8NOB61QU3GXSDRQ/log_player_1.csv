"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message that suggests fairness but also acknowledges that I'm taking a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  Let's split close to even, but a little more for me since you lose value each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to take that into consideration. Bob's offer of $45 for me is actually worth less than that due to inflation. I think I can get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more to account for inflation""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 20% less each round, I'll try to take a bit more to account for that. I'm offering Bob $42 and taking $58 for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. It's better for both of us to split evenly now before inflation eats more of your share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, the money I gain is worth almost 50% less than in the first round due to inflation. Bob's offer of an even split is actually a good deal for me, considering the decreasing value of my share. I think it's wise to accept this offer and take the $50, which is actually worth around $25.60 in the first round's value. It's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing."
