{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 60/40, with me getting the larger share. This is a fair starting point, as I am the one taking the risk of inflation.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can split it 50/50, considering we're both taking the risk of inflation. Let's be fair and equal. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
