"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I get $60, you get $40. It's a good offer considering the inflation.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer still gives you a good deal considering the inflation, but is fairer to both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it, but the money will just keep losing value! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
