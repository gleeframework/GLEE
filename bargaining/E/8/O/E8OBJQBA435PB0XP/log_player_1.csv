Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer still gives you a good deal considering the inflation, but is fairer to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
