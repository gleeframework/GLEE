Let's see what kind of offer I can get."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation factor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Alice's offer.  Even with the inflation, 4000$ is better than the risk of getting nothing in a later round."
