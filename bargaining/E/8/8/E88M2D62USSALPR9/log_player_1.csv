I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, aiming for a quick win.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal.  Although I am taking a 10% hit from inflation, Bob is taking a 20% hit.  This means his offer is even more unfair than my previous offer.  I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer based on the inflation and Bob's previous offer.  I'm still aiming for a good deal for myself, but I'm increasing Bob's share to try and incentivize him to accept."
