Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'll take a little less this time, but we need to split this fairly before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
