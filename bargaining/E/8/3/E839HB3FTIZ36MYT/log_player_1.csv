"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000 and keep the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so the effective gain is $810,000.

I don't think this offer is fair, considering the initial amount is still $1,000,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, my effective gain is now $729,000 (90% of $810,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll give you $400,000 and take $600,000 for myself.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my effective gain is now $518,700 (72.9% of $729,000).

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's better than the previous ones. I'll consider it, but I'll try to do a bit better.

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a bigger share now.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit closer to a 50-50 split, but I'm still not giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my effective gain is now $223,011 (22.3% of $1,000,000).

A 50-50 split sounds appealing, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me considering the value of the money has decreased significantly.
