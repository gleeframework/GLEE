"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, I'll take a slightly larger share this round.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round. Let's see if we can agree on a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not convinced that it's a fair split. I was hoping for a slightly more even split, considering I'm the one making the proposal this round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share this round. Let's try to find a middle ground.""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and Bob gets 45%, which is $45."
