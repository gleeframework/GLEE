"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob. It's fair.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 each, and we can end the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the relative difference in gains.

In this round, I'd get $4,000, which is 80% of the original $5,000 I would have gotten in the first round. Bob would get $6,000, which is 120% of the original $5,000 he would have gotten in the first round.

Given the relative difference in gains, I'd rather wait for a better offer. I'll reject this proposal and make a new one in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

This offer is similar to Bob's offer in Round 2, but with a slight adjustment in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's evaluate Bob's offer in Round 4. Considering the inflation effect, Bob's gain is worth 11.6% less than the original $5,000 he would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately 88.4% of the original amount.

In this round, I'd get $4,800, which is 96% of the original $5,000 I would have gotten in the first round. This is a better deal for me compared to the previous rounds, considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
