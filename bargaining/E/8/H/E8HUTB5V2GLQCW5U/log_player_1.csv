This is a tough spot.  While unfair, it's the best I can do at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of the money is plummeting for me each round. 
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob seems unwilling to budge from maximizing his gain.

If I reject this offer, I risk getting even less in future rounds. It's a gamble I can't afford."
