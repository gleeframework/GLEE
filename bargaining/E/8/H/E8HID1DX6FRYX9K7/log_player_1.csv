"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting 900,000 and Bob getting 100,000. This ensures a fair distribution while also accounting for the potential inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I propose an 80/20 split, with me getting 800,000 and Bob getting 200,000. This is a compromise considering the inflation factor and Bob's previous proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose a 70/30 split, with me getting 700,000 and Bob getting 300,000.  Given the increasing inflation, this is a reasonable offer that allows for a significant gain for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is severely impacting Bob's gain, and accepting this offer will at least guarantee me a decent sum.  The risk of getting nothing if we continue is too high."
