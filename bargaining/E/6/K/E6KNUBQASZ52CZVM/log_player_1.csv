Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob. I figure this will show him I'm fair and hopefully he'll accept. I'll keep a large portion for myself since there are many rounds to go and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to accept this offer. While I'm getting half the money, it's a significant amount and it's the most I'll get with the inflation rate. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the future."
