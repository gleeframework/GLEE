Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000. I think this is a fair split, considering we're starting with a large amount of money."
