"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering I'm taking the risk of rejection in this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $6,000 in the first round is now worth less, and I have to be careful not to end up with less in the long run.

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round.

```

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This way we both get a decent share, considering the inflation.""
