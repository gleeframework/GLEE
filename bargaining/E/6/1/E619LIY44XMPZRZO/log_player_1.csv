"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $40, and I'll take $60. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split and then see if we can improve it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can do better than my initial offer, huh?

I'll reject this offer, since it's not in my favor. I'd rather negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite one-sided, I'll make a counteroffer that's a bit more balanced. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a more even distribution of the $100. My message is a friendly invitation to meet in the middle and see if we can agree on a fair split."
