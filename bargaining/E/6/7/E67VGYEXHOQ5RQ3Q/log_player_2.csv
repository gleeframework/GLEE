"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think 50/50 is the fairest split, let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a good time to accept for a couple of reasons:

* **Fairness:** While I would have preferred my 55/45 split, 50/50 is objectively fair.
* **Inflation:**  The money is rapidly losing value. Waiting longer means we'll both get even less."
