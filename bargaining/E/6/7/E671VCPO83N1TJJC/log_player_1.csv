```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,

```

I'm offering to take $55 and give Bob $45, with a message that I think this is a fair share for both of us. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real - the value decays rapidly for you. This offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
