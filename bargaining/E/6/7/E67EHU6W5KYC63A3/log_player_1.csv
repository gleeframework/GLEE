"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While the offer seems unfair on the surface, it's important to consider inflation. 
* **Alice's Perspective:** In round 1, Alice proposed taking 900,000. Now, due to inflation, that 900,000 is worth 10% less, which is 810,000. 
* **Bob's Perspective:**  Bob's offer of 280,000 is still more than the 100,000 he was offered in round 1, even after his 20% inflation deduction.

**Conclusion:** It's better to accept the offer and secure some money, even though it's less than initially hoped for.  Continuing to reject offers could lead to further inflation, decreasing the value of the potential gains."
