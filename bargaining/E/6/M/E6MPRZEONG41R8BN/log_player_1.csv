"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $4,800 in the second round, and Bob's gain of $4,000 is still $4,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than splitting it 50/50. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my gain from the previous rounds is now worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80% of 80% of 100% = 51.2%). I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain from the previous rounds is now worth 51.2% of its original value (80% of 80% of 80% of 100% = 51.2%). Considering Bob's new offer, I think I should accept it, as it's a better offer than my previous one.
