"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 300k, it's a fair share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 dollars, which is a 30% share of the original amount. I'm keeping 700,000 dollars for myself, which is a 70% share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more equitable split.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustments, my gain of 400,000 dollars is now worth 380,000 dollars, and Bob's gain of 600,000 dollars is now worth 480,000 dollars.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as I was hoping to get a larger share. I'll reject it for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
