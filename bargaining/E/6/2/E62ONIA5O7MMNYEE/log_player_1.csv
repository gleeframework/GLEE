  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 90% and you can have 10% to see how it goes.""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can get this game going!"

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to split it down the middle. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me in the middle again. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm not willing to accept a 30% share now, especially since my gain is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint, but I'd rather take a risk and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round than settle for this offer."
