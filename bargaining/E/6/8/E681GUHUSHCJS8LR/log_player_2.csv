Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer. Here it is:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Alice's gain is worth 36% less, I should adjust my valuation accordingly.

Alice's offer in real terms is equivalent to:
Bob gain: 60 / 0.64 = 93.75
Alice gain: 40 / 0.64 = 62.5

Considering this, I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll offer a bit more to account for the difference in value.
