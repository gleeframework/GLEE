"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking $99 and giving Bob $1. It's a bit greedy, but since inflation is a factor, I want to maximize my gains in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome given the inflation factor and the risk of getting nothing if I reject and Bob makes a worse offer in the next round."
