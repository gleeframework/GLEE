"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm happy to negotiate further if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair at first, Alice gets a much bigger share of the money. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation affects us differently. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  I'm willing to give up a bit more, but I need a bigger share than 40% to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I still feel like I could get more, Alice's offer is a good compromise.  It's better than my previous offer and allows me to gain more than I would if we continued to reject offers. I'm ready to end the game."
