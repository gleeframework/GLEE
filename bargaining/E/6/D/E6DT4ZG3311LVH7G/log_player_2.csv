Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is shrinking, Alice is still getting a much larger share. It's getting riskier, but holding out for a better deal is still the best option for Bob."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle of our last offers, this is my final compromise 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The money is losing value fast. While not ideal, this offer is better than anything Bob has proposed so far, and it's unlikely Alice will go much lower. Accepting now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if the later rounds continue in this pattern."
