"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for you to settle quickly due to the higher inflation rate you face. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is tempting, I'm not sure it reflects the urgency I face. I'm willing to take a risk and see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, but I need a larger share to offset the impact of inflation.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position on inflation. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure we both face. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is more favorable than the last, I'm still experiencing a significant loss due to inflation. I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 500000,
