Even though it's not the best deal for me, accepting a 50/50 split at this point makes the most sense. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  Both our potential gains are eroding quickly. While I'm losing at a slower rate than Bob, the difference isn't significant enough to risk getting a much lower amount in later rounds.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:**  Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable sum. Rejecting and continuing carries the risk of Bob becoming more demanding, potentially leading to a worse outcome or even no deal at all. 

It's time to be pragmatic and secure a fair amount while it's still on the table."
