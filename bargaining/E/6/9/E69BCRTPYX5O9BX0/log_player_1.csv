"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60 and you get 40. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation rates. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I think 45 is a bit too low for me. I'd rather negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the initial amount, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more. Take 52, and I'll get 48. What do you say?""
}
```"
