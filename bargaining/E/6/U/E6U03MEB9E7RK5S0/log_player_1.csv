"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900,000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100,000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's end the game quickly!""
}

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm confident he'll accept it to avoid waiting for a potentially worse offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the risk of inflation looming, I think Bob's proposal is a good one. Splitting the money evenly is a fair deal, and it's better to avoid the risk of the money losing value over time.
