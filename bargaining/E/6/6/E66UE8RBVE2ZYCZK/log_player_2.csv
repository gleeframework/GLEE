Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting closer to something I'd consider ""fair"", time is working against me faster than it is against Alice. I need to push for a better split in the next couple of rounds before the inflation eats too much into my potential gains."
