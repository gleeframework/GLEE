"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Your turn Alice. I'm feeling generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:**  A 60/40 split heavily favors Alice. It's smart to see if I can get a better deal.
* **My offer (52/48):**  I need to incentivize Alice to accept before inflation eats into my potential gains. This offer is still slightly in my favor, but closer to even to make it tempting for her.  
* **Message:**  A friendly but firm message. I want to appear open to negotiation but emphasize that this deal benefits both of us."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to pressure me with the ""time is running out"" tactic, her offer is only slightly better than her first.  I need to hold firm, as accepting now would still give her a much larger share. I'm betting she'll be more willing to negotiate as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** We're now past the halfway point. The longer this goes on, the more I lose to inflation. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair and might appeal to Alice's sense of reason.
* **Direct approach:**  No more beating around the bush. I'm making it clear that I want to settle this quickly and fairly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Take this before it gets worse! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using a classic negotiation tactic, highlighting my losses and her position of strength. However, her offer is even worse than before! She's clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation factor.  

It's getting riskier, but I have to show her I'm not desperate yet.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a reasonable deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. We both know time is on your side, but this is the best you'll get. Take it or leave it."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  I need to make a move that avoids a stalemate. Offering 48/52 is a significant concession on my part but still better than anything Alice has proposed.
* **Ultimatum:** By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm serious about walking away if she refuses. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  There's a risk she'll call my bluff, but I'm hoping the combination of a somewhat reasonable offer and the threat of getting nothing will sway her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said it yourself, time is on my side. You're running out of options! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

I'm in a very tough spot.  Here's why I'm forced to accept:

* **Severe Inflation:**  My potential gains have eroded significantly. Accepting $3,000 now is better than risking getting nothing in a few rounds.
* **Alice's Strong Position:** She's clearly aware that time is her ally.  Her offers have been consistently bad, but she's betting I'll crack under pressure.
* **Limited Options:** I overplayed my hand with the ""final offer"" bluff.  Continuing to refuse likely means even worse offers, and potentially walking away with nothing. 

This is a bitter pill to swallow, but it's the most rational choice in a bad situation."
