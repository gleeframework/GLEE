Bob's idea of fair is heavily skewed in his favor due to the inflation.  I need to negotiate a better deal."

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting ridiculous.  Bob is refusing to acknowledge the reality of the situation.  I need to hold firm and hope he comes to his senses soon."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's finally come to an agreement.  I'm willing to give a little more to get this done before we both lose everything. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is cutting it close, but it's better to take a less-than-ideal deal now than risk getting nothing at all. Bob is finally starting to understand the impact of the inflation, and this offer is barely acceptable at this stage."
