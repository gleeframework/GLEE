"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I should get a bit more since I waited a round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my first offer, Bob. Now I want more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, Bob. I'm being generous with 35. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing, I need to show Alice I'm not going to be pushed around. Accepting 35 would be desperate. There's still a chance she'll offer a better deal, or at the very least, I can try for a 50/50 split again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. I'm willing to accept your initial offer. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  The value for Bob is decreasing significantly with each round. Accepting a less favorable deal now is better than risking even worse offers later.
* **Strategic Retreat:** By offering Alice her original terms, Bob signals a willingness to compromise but also sets a firm bottom line.  
* **Psychological Element:**  This offer could create a sense of urgency for Alice. She might worry that Bob is done negotiating and accept before her potential gains diminish further in future rounds."
