"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 75/25, with you receiving $2500. This seems fair considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a generous offer, it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal.  I'll see if I can secure more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While your offer was kind, I believe this is a more equitable distribution given the diminishing value of the money for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 60/40 split, with you receiving $4000. This maintains a balance while accounting for the decreasing value of money in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is significantly more favorable than my previous proposal. While a 60/40 split in her favor isn't ideal, it's a fair compromise considering the inflation."
