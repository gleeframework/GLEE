Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up a bit more this round.  Let's try 8100 for me and 1900 for you.  I'm hoping we can reach a solution before the inflation gets too bad. 
# Bob gain: 1900 
# Alice gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While the offer is better than the first round, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get a more favorable outcome by continuing to negotiate."
