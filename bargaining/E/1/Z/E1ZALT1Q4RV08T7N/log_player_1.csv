"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new proposal, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting the offer now versus waiting for another round and risking further inflation.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}

I'm offering a slightly more skewed split in my favor, hoping to maximize my gain while still giving Bob a decent share."
