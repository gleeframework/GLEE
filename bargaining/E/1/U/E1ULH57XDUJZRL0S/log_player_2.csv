Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it 60-40, I'll take the bigger share since I proposed first 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a little early to agree to such a lopsided split. Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering I'm taking the risk of proposing first.  Let's be reasonable and get this done.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle, 58-42 is a good compromise considering the inflation is affecting us both 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
We've been going back and forth, and it's getting riskier with inflation.  Let's get this done."
