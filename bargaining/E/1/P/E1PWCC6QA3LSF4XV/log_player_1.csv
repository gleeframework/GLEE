"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less after inflation, I need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, I'll consider it a reasonable proposal. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less after the second round of inflation, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better share. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I need to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth significantly less after four rounds of inflation, I'll consider Bob's offer more seriously. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
