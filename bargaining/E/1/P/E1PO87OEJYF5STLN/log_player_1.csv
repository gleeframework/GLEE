Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer is fair and gives me a slightly larger share, reflecting my slight advantage in the inflation dynamics. I'm curious to see if Bob will accept or risk the next round where he'll have more negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is better for me than the previous round, as the value of the money for me decreases less than the value for him. Although it's not as good as my initial offer, accepting this will end the game and give me a guaranteed amount."
