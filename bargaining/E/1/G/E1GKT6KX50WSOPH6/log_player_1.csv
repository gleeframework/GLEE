"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer from me, considering I'm offering Bob a significant share. Will Bob accept or propose a counteroffer?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, my offer from Round 1 would have been worth 54 and Bob's offer from Round 1 would have been worth 40.

Bob's new offer is:
# Alice gain: 45
# Bob gain: 55

I'll accept Bob's offer.
