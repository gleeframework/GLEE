"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for Bob, his offer is actually a better deal for me than the 50/50 split I proposed earlier. I'll accept Bob's offer.
