Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is still heavily skewed in Bob's favor. While the inflation is hurting, I need to hold out for a better offer."

Round 6

This is a tough one, and it's getting dangerous. However, Bob saying it's his ""final offer"" is likely a bluff.  I need to push him further, even if it's risky."
