"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it's a good way to kick off the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A bit more for me, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30/70 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than before, I need to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 30/70, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, 45/55, a fair compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise!"
