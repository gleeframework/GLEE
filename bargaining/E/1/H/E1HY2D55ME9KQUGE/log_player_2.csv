"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you take 10%. We can work out a better deal in the following rounds. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. 10% is too low, and I'm willing to take the risk of going to the next round to try to get a better deal. Besides, with inflation, the money is worth less to me with each passing round, so I want to try to get as much as I can as soon as possible.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What's Alice's next move?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. 60% for you, 40% for me. We both get a decent share, and we can avoid further inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to be more reasonable and find a compromise. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in settling early and avoiding further losses due to inflation.\n\nYour turn! What's Alice's response?"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. 70% for me, 30% for you.  Let's get this done before the inflation eats away too much. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. Although the money is worth less to me now due to inflation, I still think 30% is too low. I'm willing to take the risk of going to the next round to try to get a better deal. I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to compromise as the rounds go on and the effects of inflation become more pronounced.\n\nYour turn! What's Alice's next move?"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. 55% for you, 45% for me. Inflation is taking its toll, let's settle this soon.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, while still being reasonable. I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm willing to compromise and meet me in the middle. The effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced, so I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to settle.\n\nYour turn! What's Alice's response?"
