"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth even less. I'll think carefully about this offer...

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation is still affecting my gains, I'll make a new offer that takes that into account. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly higher amount to Bob, hoping he'll accept."
