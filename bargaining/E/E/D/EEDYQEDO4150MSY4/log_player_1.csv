"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor,  hoping Bob will accept since he's getting something. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though I'm getting a smaller share, I know that if we move to the next round, I'll be the one making the offer and I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

This time I'm going to offer 80% for myself and 20% for Bob. It's a smaller share for him, but I think it's still enough to incentivize him to accept rather than risk losing everything in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 260200 
# Bob gain: 739800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth a lot less now, I know that if we move to the next round, I'll be the one making the offer. I still have a chance to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer a 70/30 split in my favor.  The inflation is really starting to bite now, so I need to get a good deal for myself before it gets even worse.  I think Bob might accept, as he's getting a much smaller share than before, and he risks losing everything in the next round."
