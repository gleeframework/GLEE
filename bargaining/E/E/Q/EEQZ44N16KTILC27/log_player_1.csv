Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Let's wrap this up now.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money Alice, literally! Let's be reasonable and split this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stalling, hoping I'll panic as the deadline approaches and accept a bad deal.  I need to hold firm to get a better offer, even if it means going into later rounds where inflation will hurt more."

Round 5

""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. Let's make a deal. This is a fair offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I am lowering my demand slightly to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but not by much.
* **Urgency:** I'm reminding Bob that time is running out and impacting my potential gain.
* **Framing:** I'm presenting this offer as ""fair"" to make it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. This is a very reasonable offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to take advantage! While his offer is slightly better, it's not enough to offset the impact of inflation. I need to remain resolute and show him I'm serious about getting a fair share. I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds to avoid getting lowballed."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is the best you'll get considering we're running out of time.  Don't let greed cost you everything.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Concession:**  I'm dropping my demand a bit more, but still aiming for a significant majority. 
* **Shifting Blame:** My message is designed to put pressure on Bob, making him worry that *he's* the one being unreasonable.
* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, the clock is a major factor now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. Take it or leave it.  The clock is ticking for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I need to be realistic. Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The inflation is really eating into my potential gains. Waiting any longer could result in getting even less. 
* **Bob's Tone:** ""Final offer"" suggests he's unlikely to budge further.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in the few remaining rounds is a huge gamble now.  It's not worth the risk of walking away with nothing."
