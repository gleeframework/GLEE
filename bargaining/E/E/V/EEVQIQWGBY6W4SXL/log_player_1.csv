"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer is a 60/40 split, which I believe is a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer a more equitable split, accepting this offer is the best option.  The inflation means that rejecting and making a counter-offer will likely result in a worse outcome for me in the next round."
