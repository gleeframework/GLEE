Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous and offering Bob a small amount.  This might encourage him to accept quickly and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This seems like a fair deal, especially considering the inflation factor. Accepting ensures I get at least half the money, which is better than risking further inflation and getting less in future rounds."
