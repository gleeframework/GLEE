"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split, in my favor this time, is a fair way to start the negotiation.  Let's see if you'll accept it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't accept Bob's offer. I think a 60-40 split in his favor is too lopsided, especially considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you 45, but I think 55 is a fairer split considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $55 and Bob $45."
