"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure I'm taking the risk of being rejected and going into the next round, so I should get the bigger share.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's clear Bob is not going to be generous. With inflation, accepting this offer is the best way to secure at least some of the money."
