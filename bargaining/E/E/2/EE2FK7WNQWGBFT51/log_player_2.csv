# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. We both deserve a fair share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it closer to even this time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}
I still think I can get a better deal. Since the money is worth less now due to inflation, I'll try to get more to compensate for the loss in value. Let's see what Alice comes up with next!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I see we're getting closer, Alice. How about we try this split? Remember, inflation is eating away at our money.""}\n\nI'm trying to nudge Alice a bit closer to my desired share while reminding her that time is of the essence due to inflation. Hopefully, this proposal will be more to her liking."
