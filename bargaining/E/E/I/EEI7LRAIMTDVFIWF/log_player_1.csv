"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'll be getting $6,400 instead of $8,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. I'm not getting the majority of the money, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better deal in the next round.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll think about it, Bob. I'll make a new offer in the next round.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after the first round, and then another 20% decrease due to inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of its original value. So, I'll be getting $6,400.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit less, Alice. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 41.6% of its original value, so I'll be getting $4,160.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's the best option for me. I was hoping to get a larger share of the money, and now I'm being offered a smaller share than in the previous round.

However, I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer, and I'm running out of rounds. I'll accept this offer.
