"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, I'll take the majority""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split, where I get 750,000$ and Bob gets 250,000$. I'm framing it as a generous offer, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering we both lose value over time. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculations.

In Round 2, the total amount is still $1,000,000, but it's worth less due to inflation. My gain of 400,000$ is worth 80% of what it was in Round 1, and Bob's gain of 600,000$ is worth 95% of what it was in Round 1.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 60/40 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'll try to make a counteroffer in Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth even less due to inflation. My gain of 400,000$ is now worth 64% of what it was in Round 1, and Bob's gain of 600,000$ is worth 90.25% of what it was in Round 1.

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}
```

I'm proposing a 420,000$ gain for myself and 580,000$ gain for Bob, trying to find a more balanced split."
