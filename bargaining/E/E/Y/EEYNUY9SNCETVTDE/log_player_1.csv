This is a risky strategy, but I'm trying to maximize my share early on before inflation kicks in.  I'm betting that Bob will accept, as even a small amount is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred more, this is a fair split given the inflation.  I'm not sure how much Bob is losing due to inflation, but it's clear that he's willing to compromise. Accepting this offer means I get a significant amount and avoid the risk of getting nothing if we continue to play."
