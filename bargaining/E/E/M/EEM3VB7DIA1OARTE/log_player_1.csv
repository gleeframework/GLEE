Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you closer to the middle, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer in Round 4 is the best strategic move for Alice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly than Alice. Each round he delays, his potential gains decrease significantly.
* **Future Uncertainty:** If Alice rejects this offer, there's no guarantee that Bob's next offer will be better. He might become even more desperate and propose a less favorable split.
* **Reasonable Gain:**  A $48 gain is still significant. Holding out for a marginally better deal carries the risk of ending up with a much worse outcome if negotiations continue to stall."
