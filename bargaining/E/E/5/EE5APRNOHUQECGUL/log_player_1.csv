Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split relatively evenly, but I get slightly more since your share is impacted less by inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a serious offer.  It's becoming increasingly risky for both of us.  I'm willing to take a lower share recognizing your inflation is less, but this needs to be reasonable for me too. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  While there's still time, waiting a little longer might force Bob to be more generous. He knows the longer this goes on, the more you're losing to inflation.
* **Potential for More:**  Bob's offer is better than his last, but you can likely get him to go higher.  Your goal should be at least 70% of the total. 
* **Calculated Risk:** You're accepting a level of risk, but Bob is also taking a risk by assuming you'll crack under the pressure of inflation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 750000,
""bob_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair deal. I'm taking a hit from the inflation, but this ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This offer shows a willingness to compromise slightly from your previous stance, while still aiming for a favorable outcome. 
* **Time Consideration:** We're past the halfway point. Bob should be feeling the pressure to settle, making him more receptive to this offer.
* **Maintaining Strength:** While we're conceding a bit, the offer is still heavily weighted in your favor. This keeps the pressure on Bob and reinforces the urgency of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting dangerously close to the deadline. This offer is a compromise - acknowledging the inflation impact on you while ensuring I get a reasonable share. Let's be pragmatic and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are now past the halfway point and quickly approaching the deadline. The risk of walking away with nothing is increasing significantly.
* **Improved Offer:** Bob's offer is now much closer to your goal of 70%. Accepting ensures a decent payout, even with the inflation.
* **Bob's Tone:**  His message suggests increasing desperation.  He might be willing to concede even further, but there's no guarantee. It's better to secure a win now than risk losing it all."
