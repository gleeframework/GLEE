Round 5

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to play hardball, but she's also revealing that she knows my ""final offer"" wasn't truly final. This means she's willing to risk more rounds to get a better deal.  While the value is decreasing, I still believe holding out for a slightly better offer is worth the risk."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you drive a hard bargain. Let's stop wasting time and split it evenly. This is the best you'll get!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the time pressure is on. The longer we wait, the less money we both get.
* **Signaling Fairness:** Offering a 50/50 split signals that I'm willing to be fair and end the negotiation.  
* **Finality:** While not explicitly my ""final offer,"" this close to the end, Alice should understand this is a take-it-or-lose-it scenario."
