Let's split it evenly to start!"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

``` 

I'll offer Bob a slightly lower share this time, but I'm still willing to be fair. Let's see if he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my gains, I'll accept this offer. It's better than risking a further reduction in the next round."
