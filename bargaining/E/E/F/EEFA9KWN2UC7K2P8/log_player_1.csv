"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll get a good chunk, but it's a fair start""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get a smaller share this time, but it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer for round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55:45""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount and leaving some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get a smaller share this time, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be even more careful with my decisions. However, I still don't want to give up too much.

I'll reject Bob's offer for round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, but it's getting increasingly difficult with the inflation!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly! Here's my new offer for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still need to get a decent amount""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a reasonable amount and leaving room for future negotiations, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a small share, but I need to get the majority 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now!

Considering the extremely low value of the money, I'll have to be extremely cautious with my decisions. However, getting only $100,000 is a very low amount, and I'm not sure if I want to accept such a small share.

I'll reject Bob's offer for round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal in the next round, but it's getting increasingly difficult to make ends meet with the inflation!"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly! Here's my new offer for round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 250000,
  ""bob_gain"": 750000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I need to get something""
}
```

I'm trying to be realistic about the value of the money at this point, and I'm willing to give up a significant amount to Bob in order to get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take almost all, but I'll give you a token amount 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting!

Getting only $50,000 is an extremely low amount, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint and the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

I'll accept Bob's offer for round 8:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a very small consolation prize, but I'll take it."
