Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal before accepting. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
