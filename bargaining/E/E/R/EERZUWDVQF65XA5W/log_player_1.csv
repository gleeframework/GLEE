"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us started""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30, and I'm framing it as a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and we can adjust later if needed. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my calculations.

In this round, I would gain $50, which is 5% less than the $70 I could have gained in the first round. However, Bob's gain of $50 is 10% less than the $30 he could have gained in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is the best deal for me, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me, and I want to keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a larger share this time""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, and I'm framing it as a compromise that gives me a bit more than before. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
