"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $5,000 x 0.9 = $4,500.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a 50/50 split, and it's a fair deal considering the reduced value of money due to inflation.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
