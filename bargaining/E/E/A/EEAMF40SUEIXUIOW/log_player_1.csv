I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself $900,000 and Bob $100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm lowering my offer to 80/20, giving myself $800,000 and Bob $200,000. This is still a significant amount for both of us, and I hope Bob will see that it's better than waiting for further inflation to make his share even smaller."
