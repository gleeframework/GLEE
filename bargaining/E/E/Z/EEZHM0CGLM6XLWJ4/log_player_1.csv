I'm starting with an aggressive offer, taking almost everything. Since you're the one facing inflation, I want to secure the lion's share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but it still leaves me with the majority.  Inflation is a serious threat, and I need to secure a decent amount before it eats away at my share even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, inflation is hitting hard. Accepting this offer means I at least get something, and Bob gets the majority he desires."
