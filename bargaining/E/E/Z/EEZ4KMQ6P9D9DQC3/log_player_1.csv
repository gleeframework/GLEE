"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 45 dollars is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is 0.95 \* 60 = 57 dollars.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it's even more skewed towards Bob's gain than my initial offer. I'll reject this proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give up more than this, take it or leave it.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering to take 55 dollars and leave 45 dollars for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 50 dollars is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, which is 0.8574 \* 60 = 51.84 dollars.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. On one hand, it's a 50/50 split, which is fair. On the other hand, I'm still not getting the maximum value I could get if I could negotiate further. I'll accept this offer, but only because I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
