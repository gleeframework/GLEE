"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk waiting for a worse offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
