Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts me less, being firm 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that inflation hurts Bob more, but she's using that to push for an increasingly unfair deal. While the difference is less significant than in earlier rounds, Bob still loses a much larger percentage of the initial value due to inflation. Rejecting keeps the pressure on Alice and forces her to make a better offer as we approach the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time and split it evenly. This is the fairest deal for both of us with the deadline approaching.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With the rounds passing and inflation increasing, it's becoming riskier to keep pushing for a larger share. A 50/50 split is fair and puts pressure on Alice.  If she rejects this, she risks getting a worse deal in the later rounds as the value decreases significantly for both of us."
