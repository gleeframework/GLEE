"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI made an offer to divide the money, where I get $6000 and Bob gets $4000. I also included a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal. If he accepts, the game is over and we'll divide the money according to my proposal. If he rejects, the game will move on to the next round, and it will be his turn to make a proposal. Remember that with each passing round, the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, but its value remains the same for Bob. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  Fair is fair. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the effect of inflation on my gain. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less in this round, I would actually be getting less value than Bob, even if the amounts are numerically equal. I want to try to get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make a new offer to try to reach an agreement with Bob. I'll propose a division where I get $5800 and Bob gets $4200. I'll include a message saying ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split"" to explain my reasoning.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI made an offer to divide the money, where I get $5800 and Bob gets $4200.

Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal. If he accepts, the game is over and we'll divide the money according to my proposal.
