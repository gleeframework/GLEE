"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60/40 split, keeping $6000 for myself and giving $4000 to Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage Bob will face in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option for me. The inflation rate is working against me, and if I reject this offer, the money I could potentially gain in the next round would be significantly reduced."
