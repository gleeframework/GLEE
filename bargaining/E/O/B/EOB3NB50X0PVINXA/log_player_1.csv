"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to take 90 dollars for myself and give 10 dollars to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation in future rounds, but gives Bob a small incentive to accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money,  the inflation makes accepting Bob's offer the best choice.  If I reject, I risk getting nothing at all."
