"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the value of the money may decrease with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since I'm already losing 5% of my potential gain due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think we should be closer to 50/50""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than the original split, but still gives me a slight advantage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go up to a 65/35 split, but I think it's important to account for the inflation. Let's try to come to an agreement before the value of the money drops further. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept a 65/35 split, especially since I'm already losing a significant amount due to inflation. I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation, and I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think we should be closer to 50/50. Let's meet in the middle""}

I'm proposing a 48/52 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my previous offer, but still gives me a slight advantage. I'm trying to find a compromise that takes into account the inflation and Bob's concerns."
