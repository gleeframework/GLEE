I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, hoping to secure the vast majority of the money.  Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'm taking a gamble that he'll be more willing to accept a small amount now than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being more aggressive, but I still think I can do better. I'll reject his offer and try to get a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm adjusting my offer slightly to account for Bob's willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping that he'll be more willing to accept a smaller amount now, rather than risk getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting better for him, I'm still holding out for a larger share. The inflation is working in my favor, so I'm going to keep trying to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm still trying to get as much as possible, but I'm starting to realize that Bob is becoming more and more desperate with each passing round. I'm going to lower my offer a bit more to try and secure a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is starting to really hurt Bob. He's already lost a significant chunk of the potential value of his share, and the longer we wait, the worse it will get for him. This offer is still pretty good for me, and it's probably the best I can expect given the current situation. I'm going to accept and secure a large portion of the money before things get even worse for Bob."
