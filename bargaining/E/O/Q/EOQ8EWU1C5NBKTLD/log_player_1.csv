"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I hope Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the large disparity in our gains. I'd like to see a more even split.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept Bob's offer just yet. I'd like to see a more balanced distribution of the funds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. This split seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, just like you said. Let's end this game with a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm surprised Bob is willing to meet me halfway now! Given the significant decrease in the value of the money due to inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I accept the 50/50 split. Let's end the game.""
}
```

I think this is a fair and reasonable outcome, considering the circumstances."
