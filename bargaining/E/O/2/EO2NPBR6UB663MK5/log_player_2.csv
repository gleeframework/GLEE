"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the impact of inflation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counter-proposal in the next round, potentially securing a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I believe a 60/40 split is more equitable considering the inflation rates we face.  Let's make this deal and move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it would be nice to get more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money, and continuing to reject offers will only make it worse. This offer is a good middle ground and ensures Bob gets a decent amount."
