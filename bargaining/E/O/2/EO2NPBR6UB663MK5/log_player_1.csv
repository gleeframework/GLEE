"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $600,000, while Bob would receive $400,000. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and possibly end the game early, minimizing the impact of inflation on both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is more equitable considering the inflation rates we face.  Let's make this deal and move on. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his argument for a 60/40 split considering inflation, the offer of $400,000 for me in the second round is significantly less than what I initially proposed for myself in the first round ($600,000). Additionally, accepting this offer would mean I lose out on a substantial amount of money compared to my initial proposal, and the game has just begun. I believe there's room for negotiation that could result in a more favorable outcome for me, especially considering the differing inflation rates affecting our gains. By rejecting, I get to propose the next offer, aiming for a better deal while also factoring in the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nIn this offer, I've reduced my initial gain from $600,000 to $550,000, and increased Bob's share from $400,000 to $450,000, attempting to find a middle ground that might be more acceptable to Bob given the impact of inflation on both our potential gains. I'm hoping that by showing willingness to compromise, Bob might be more inclined to accept this offer and end the game before further inflation devalues the money."
