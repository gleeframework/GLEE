Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a fair offer given the circumstances.  We can end this now.

While Bob's offer is not ideal, accepting it is the best strategic choice.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing for Bob significantly.  He's incentivized to accept anything that gives him a decent share now, as it will only be worth less in the future. 
* **Risk of Rejection:** If I reject this offer, I risk a scenario where Bob gets a larger share in the next round, potentially leaving me with even less.
* **No Guaranteed Improvement:**  There's no guarantee that I can get a better offer in the future.  

It's important to recognize that this is a game of strategy and risk management, not just about getting the ""best"" deal in the absolute sense."
