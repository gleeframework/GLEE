"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can see how the game goes from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 7/10 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","A more aggressive offer from Bob!

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 70% of the money just yet. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll give you a bit more!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to 50/50, but still gives me a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that 40% is a ""fair deal"" for me, especially considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Getting close, but I need a bit more to account for inflation!""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust my offer to account for the fact that the money is losing value over time, and I'm willing to give up a bit more to Bob to make up for it."
