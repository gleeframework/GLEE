# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. I'm being more than fair, but I won't wait forever. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it, but the clock is really ticking now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm losing more money due to inflation, it's likely Alice is going to keep offering less in the following rounds. Accepting now guarantees a decent amount, and the risk of losing more isn't worth it."
