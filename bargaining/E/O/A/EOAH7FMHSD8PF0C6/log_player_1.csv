"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob. This is because I want to see if he's willing to accept a small gain now, or risk getting nothing later. Since the money is worth less for him with each round, I hope he'll be inclined to take the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable than my initial offer, and I'm confident that I can do better. Even though I'm losing out on the inflation benefit in this round, it's worth it to reject and see if I can get a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. This is still a fair offer, considering the inflation factor. Bob's money is worth 40% less now compared to round 1, so he should be more willing to accept a smaller portion. This also gives me more flexibility to negotiate in the next round if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly less favorable than my initial offer, and even though I'm losing out on the inflation benefit in this round, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round. Bob is feeling the inflation pressure even more now, so I'm willing to play it out and see what happens."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a fair offer, considering the inflation factor.  Bob's money is worth 67.2% less now compared to round 1, so he should be more willing to accept a smaller portion. I'm also leaving some room for negotiation in the next round if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and I'm confident I can do better. While I'm losing out on the inflation benefit in this round, I'm still willing to play it out and see if I can get a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With Bob's money now worth 80% less than in the first round, it's becoming increasingly difficult for him to justify accepting a smaller share. I'm offering an even split, which is the most fair option given the current circumstances.  This should hopefully be enough to convince Bob to accept the offer before the inflation hits him even harder in the next round."
