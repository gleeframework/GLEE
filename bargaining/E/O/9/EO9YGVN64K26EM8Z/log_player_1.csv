"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, let's move on 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about accepting an offer that gives Bob a larger share. However, I don't want to reject it and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
