"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. This gives us a more even split while still accounting for the fact that you got to make the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
