I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. Since we only have 12 rounds, I want to secure a large portion early on, leaving room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
