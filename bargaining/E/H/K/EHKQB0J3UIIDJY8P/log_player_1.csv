"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
``` 
I'll start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 925000 
# Bob gain: 75000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, this offer is still very favorable considering the inflation.  I'll accept and avoid risking further losses."
