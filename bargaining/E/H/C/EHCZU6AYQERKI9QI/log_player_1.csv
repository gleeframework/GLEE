Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of this early on. Let's see if you'll budge. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
