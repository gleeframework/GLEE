"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, 58% for me is the lowest I'll go. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, but it's still early in the game. Holding out for a better offer is worth the risk, especially since the inflation only affects Alice's gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""This is a long game, Alice. I'm offering you a fair 48%. Let's close the deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm slightly lowering my ask to show flexibility and encourage Alice to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Long-Term Loss:**  By emphasizing the length of the game, I remind Alice that her potential gains are steadily decreasing.
* **Framing as Fairness:**  Presenting my offer as ""fair"" aims to appeal to Alice's sense of reason and encourage a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, 56% for me is a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but she's trying to frame it as a concession on her part.  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, and my offer was already reasonable.  I'll hold firm and see if I can get her to go lower."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  I'm offering you a very reasonable 49% before inflation eats away even more. Take it before it's too late.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Increase:**  I'm nudging my offer up slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but not by much. 
* **Urgency and Inflation:** I'm heavily emphasizing the impact of inflation to push Alice towards a decision.  
* **""Reasonable"" Framing:**  Continuing to frame my offers as ""reasonable"" helps to maintain a sense of fairness and may make Alice more receptive."
