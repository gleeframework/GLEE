Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a classic 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure Bob might accept it, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's clear Bob is willing to negotiate.  The 75/25 split is still a decent gain for me, and with the risk of getting nothing at all in later rounds, it's better to take what I can get."
