"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 100-0 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a compromise. Let's see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 60-40 split. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still hoping for a better deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to give Bob a slightly better deal while still keeping a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle. Will you accept this 50/50 split? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth even less due to inflation, I'm getting a bit desperate. However, a 50-50 split seems like a reasonable compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the 50 dollars. I'm not sure if I could get a better deal, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with the value of money decreasing."
