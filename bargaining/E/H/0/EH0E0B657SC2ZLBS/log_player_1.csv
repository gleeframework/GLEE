"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I need to adjust my gain accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer because it's still not favorable to me. The money I'd gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so I need to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split to account for the continued inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be cautious and consider whether this offer is still acceptable.

After some thought, I'll decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's still a significant amount, and the inflation has reduced the value of the money I'd gain in subsequent rounds."
