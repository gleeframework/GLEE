"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste time. This offer is still heavily in your favor considering the time pressure and inflation working against me.  Take it now before it's too late for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is hitting her harder than me, and I'm betting she'll get more desperate in later rounds.  I'm willing to push my luck a little further."

Round 4

{

""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My offers are more than fair considering the shrinking pot from my perspective.  Let's be logical, accept this deal, and avoid a mutually disastrous outcome! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure, and her message reflects that.  While her offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still in her favor. We're over halfway through the rounds, and the inflation is increasingly working against her. I'm willing to hold out a little longer to see if I can secure an even better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
