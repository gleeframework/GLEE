"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, it's better than nothing 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The impact of inflation is becoming increasingly significant. It's worth holding out for a better offer, as Alice is losing value at a faster rate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, let's split the difference 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a close call, but the impact of inflation is becoming too significant to ignore. 

* **Time pressure:**  We are now past the halfway point of the rounds. If we continue to reject offers, we risk running out of time and getting nothing.
* **Alice's offer:** While still slightly in Alice's favor, it's the closest she's come to an even split. 
* **Inflation:** Every round that passes diminishes the value of the money. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable, though not ideal, payout. 

It's a gamble, but accepting now minimizes potential losses due to the accelerating inflation."
