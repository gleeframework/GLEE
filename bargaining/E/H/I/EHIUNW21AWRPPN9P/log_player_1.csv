"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can split the remaining 100k later.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount upfront, but still a decent chunk of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no tricks! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's actually $475,000 in real terms.

I'm not sure I want to give up half of the remaining money, considering the inflation. I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly more aggressive this time around. I'll try to get a larger share of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away with a 50/50 split that easily! Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up much more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. My $700,000 from the previous round is now worth $599,000 in real terms, but my offer of $200,000 in this round is only worth $179,000.

Considering the significant difference in our proposed shares, I'm inclined to reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gains, I'll need to be more aggressive in my offer. I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a free ride, Bob. I'm taking what I can get.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up much more, Alice. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential gains. My $700,000 from the previous round is now worth $542,000 in real terms, and my offer of $100,000 in this round is only worth $77,000.

Considering the significant difference in our proposed shares and the fact that I'm not getting any closer to a deal, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gains, I'll need to be extremely aggressive in my offer. I'll aim to get as much as I can, even if it means leaving Bob with a smaller share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or we'll go to arbitration.""

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up my last chance to get a fair deal. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. My $800,000 from the previous round is now worth $560,000 in real terms, and my offer of $1000 in this round is only worth $700 in real terms.

Considering the extremely lopsided nature of this offer, I'll reject it. $700 is a tiny fraction of what I could have gotten in earlier rounds, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share of the remaining money.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode my potential gains, I'll make a desperate attempt to get as much as I can. I'll offer a very small amount to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 999000,
  ""message"": ""Fine, take it. You're not getting any better offer from me.""
}
```

Note: I'm essentially mirroring Bob's offer from the previous round, but I'm the one making it this time."
