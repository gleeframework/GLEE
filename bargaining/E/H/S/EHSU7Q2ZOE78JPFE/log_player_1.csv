"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll need to get a better deal to make it worth my while.

```

}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to take a bit more for myself this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 47.6 
# Bob gain: 52.4 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is making the money worth less and less for Bob, so I should take advantage of that. This offer is a good opportunity to get a better deal.
