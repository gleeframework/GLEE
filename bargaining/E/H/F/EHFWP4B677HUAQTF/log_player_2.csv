Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, but time is running out. While the offer is better than her previous ones, it's worth holding out a little longer to see if she'll offer something closer to 50/50.  We need to apply pressure with our next offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, the clock is ticking.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the wire. This offer is a slight concession on my part, aiming for a 51/49 split in my favor.  The ""final offer"" message adds pressure and signals I'm serious about not settling for less.  Alice is likely to understand that with the increasing inflation, further delays will only hurt both of us."
