70.0,30.0,"Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30.  It's in your best interest to accept quickly, as the value decreases faster for you.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need more than $30. Let's split it 60/40, which is better for both of us in the long run.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking. My offer is now $65 for me, $35 for you. This is still more than you'd get with your 60/40 split if we wait much longer!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
55.0,45.0,"Alice, we're both losing value with each round. Let's be reasonable and split it 45/55. It's a better deal for you than my last offer, and I'll get more than your current proposal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
60.0,40.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is now $60 for me and $40 for you.  This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, but the deal is getting worse for both of us with every passing round!",Alice,5,
