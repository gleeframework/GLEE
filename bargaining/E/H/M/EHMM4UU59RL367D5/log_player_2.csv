"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a decent cut. Take it or we can negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with that offer. I think we can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be more realistic. I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I believe this is a fairer starting point.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still need a larger share. This is my final offer before inflation hits harder. Take it or we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, the risk of losing more with each passing round is too high. I'll accept this offer."
