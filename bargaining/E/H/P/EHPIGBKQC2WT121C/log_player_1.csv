"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, given the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I'm ready to accept Bob's offer just yet. I was hoping for a slightly better split. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I think I should get a bit more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share given the inflation."
