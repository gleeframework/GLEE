Even though the offer is relatively good now, it's important to consider the potential gains later in the game, and the effects of inflation."

Alice's offer is better than the previous round, but it's still not a good deal for me considering the inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

While Alice's offer is not ideal, with inflation being so severe, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. The risk of getting nothing outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal later."
