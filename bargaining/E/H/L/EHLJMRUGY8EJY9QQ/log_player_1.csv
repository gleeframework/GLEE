{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  I'm going to be generous in this first round, but I'm aware of the inflation risk.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer.  While he's offering me more than he did in the first round, I believe I can get a better deal. I know that inflation is a factor, but I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can secure a larger share of the money."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I still believe I can secure a good deal. I'm aware of inflation, but I'm confident that I can secure a majority of the money. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While he's offering me more than he did in the previous round, it's still significantly less than what I was aiming for.  I understand inflation is making the money worth less, but I'm not ready to give up so much of the potential gain yet. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but I'm acknowledging the increasing effects of inflation.  This offer is a compromise, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a better alternative to the potential risk of further rounds."
