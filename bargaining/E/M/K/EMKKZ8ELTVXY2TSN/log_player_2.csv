"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's end this quickly.  A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush, especially with inflation looming.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split. It accounts for the inflation, and gives us both a good amount. Let's end it here.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The longer this goes on, the less your share is truly worth.  This offer is still generous considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
