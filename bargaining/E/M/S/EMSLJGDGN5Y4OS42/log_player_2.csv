"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can work towards a more even split later if you accept. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because Alice is taking 90% of the money, which is a very uneven split. Since I have 12 rounds to negotiate, I'll try to get a better deal in the next round. Additionally, the 5% inflation rate per round doesn't significantly impact the value of the money at this stage, so I can afford to wait. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I'd like a more even split, considering we both want a share. Let's compromise.""}\n\nSince I rejected Alice's initial offer, it's my turn to propose a division. I've decided to offer a split of 40% for myself and 60% for Alice. This is a more even split than Alice's initial offer, but still gives her a larger share. My message to Alice emphasizes the importance of compromise, as we both want a share of the money. The inflation rate is still relatively low at this stage, so I'm not too concerned about the decrease in value. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it."
