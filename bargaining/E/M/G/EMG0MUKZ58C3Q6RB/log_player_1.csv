"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a decent share, but don't expect me to go easy on you!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the initial amount. This leaves me with $700,000, which is 70% of the initial amount. Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're off to a strong start, but I'm not afraid of a challenge. I'll take a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

In this round, I'd be getting $600,000, which is worth 60% of the initial amount (since it's 10% less than the $700,000 I would have gotten in the previous round). Bob would be getting $400,000, which is worth 40% of the initial amount (since it's 20% less than the $500,000 he would have gotten in the previous round).

I'm not thrilled about giving up a larger share, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep negotiating, hoping to get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since Bob rejected my previous offer and now the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""You're being greedy, Bob! I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need to protect my interests.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is worth 20% of the initial amount, and I'll take $800,000, which is worth 80% of the initial amount. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being cautious, I'll give you credit for that. But I'm not going to back down. I'll meet you in the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 650000 
# Bob gain: 350000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation rate, the money is devaluing rapidly. In this round, I'd be getting $650,000, which is worth 65% of the initial amount (since it's 27.1% less than the $900,000 I would have gotten in the previous round). Bob would be getting $350,000, which is worth 35% of the initial amount (since it's 48.8% less than the $680,000 he would have gotten in the previous round).

Considering the rapid devaluation of the money, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept it to avoid further losses.
