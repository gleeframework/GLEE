"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I propose to take 990,000$ and give Bob 10,000$.  This seems like a fair offer, especially considering inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy. Due to inflation, the money I'll gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal if I reject this offer."
