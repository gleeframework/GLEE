"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the risk of inflation. It allows for a more balanced division while still acknowledging the potential for future value decrease. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
