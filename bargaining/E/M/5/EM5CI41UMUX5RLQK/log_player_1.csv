"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This allows us both to share the funds, with a slight emphasis on my share due to the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in our favor. This is a fairer split considering the higher inflation rate you're facing.  Let's work together and get a deal done! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
