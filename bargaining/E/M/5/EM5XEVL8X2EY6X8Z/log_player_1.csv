"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

This is a 45-55 split, which I hope Bob will find more acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant reduction in the value of money, I'm getting more cautious. However, this offer is still a 40-60 split, which is closer to the initial 40-60 split I offered in the first round.

I'll accept this offer.
