"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This is a standard bargaining strategy, offering a slightly unfair split in your favor to try and get a quick resolution.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The money is worth less with each round, and Bob's offer is a fair 50/50 split. It's in my best interest to accept and avoid the risk of getting an even worse deal in future rounds."
