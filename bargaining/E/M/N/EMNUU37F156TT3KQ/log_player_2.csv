Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share. However, considering the inflation,  I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is the fairest option for both of us at this point. This will allow us to avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
