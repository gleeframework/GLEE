"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 20% less, I think I'm at a disadvantage here. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is still worth the same for me, I'll try to be more aggressive this time. Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

I'm taking a larger share, hoping that Bob will accept this time."
