Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think 65-35 is a bit too skewed in Bob's favor.

Round 3
