"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60-40, I'll meet you halfway at 55-45, but I'll keep the extra 5% for myself 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","A tough negotiation!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to reject it. I was hoping for a more even split, and 55-45 is still a bit too skewed towards Bob's favor, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you at 58-42, but I'm not budging further.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you at 50-50, no more negotiating, take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split is a fair offer, especially considering the inflation that's been eating away at the value of the money. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game.
