**Reasoning:**

Even though time pressure is mounting, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant amount of the potential gains due to inflation. It's a better strategy to hold out and propose a more equitable split in the next round, hoping Alice will recognize the urgency."

# Alice's message: Your share is melting, better take this 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The relentless inflation is severely eroding Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer now secures a reasonable sum before it diminishes further.  The longer the game continues, the worse Bob's position becomes."
