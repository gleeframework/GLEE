"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a 90/10 split in my favor!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's better to accept the offer, as 5% of $9000 is $450, meaning I would only receive $8550 if I reject this offer and move on to the next round."
