"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, so we both get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I need to think carefully about this offer. I'd rather not take the smaller share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either.

I'll reject the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now (10% less in the first round, and another 10% less in the second round), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting a bit desperate. However, I still don't want to give Bob the majority of the money.

I'll accept the offer.
