"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to propose a very lopsided split. I'll take nearly all the money, leaving just $1 for Bob.  Since the money inflates for Bob, this seems like a pretty good deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. While the money I gain is worth the same, Bob's offer isn't enough to compensate for the potential inflation. I'm willing to wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share this time, but I still want to keep the majority.  Since the money is inflating for Bob, I'm confident this is a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 424000 
# Bob gain: 576000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While Bob's offer is much lower than what I proposed in round 3, the inflation is rapidly decreasing the value of his money. Accepting this offer gives me a substantial amount, and I'm not sure I can expect a better deal in the future."
