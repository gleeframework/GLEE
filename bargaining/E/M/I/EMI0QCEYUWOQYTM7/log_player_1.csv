"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's split it now!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in effect, the money is worth less, and Bob's offer is still quite generous.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will come up with an even better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the inflation:

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this compromise and accept the offer!"

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not sure this is a good deal for me! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a bigger toll, the money is worth even less. Bob's offer is still quite close to my previous one, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will make a more generous proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair share!""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but I want to make sure we're really splitting it 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With the money worth so much less, I'm starting to get a bit desperate.

However, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is a very tempting one. It's not the best I could have gotten earlier, but considering the current state of the money, it's a fair deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that we can finally end this game and split the remaining $1,000,000 50/50."
