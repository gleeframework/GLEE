"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, and he's still offering me the same amount as before, I'm not getting a better deal. I'll accept his offer.
