Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a risk with inflation. My offer stands: 6000 for me, 4000 for you. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is becoming more inflexible. While her offer remains the same, its actual value for her is decreasing significantly.  I'm willing to bet she'll become more desperate and offer a larger share in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a deal where you still get a significant amount, even with the inflation. Don't be greedy, take the win.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to apply more pressure.  By offering Alice slightly less than her previous offer, but framing it as a ""win"" given the inflation, I'm hoping to exploit her increasing desperation. This offer is risky, but the potential reward of securing a larger share is worth it."
