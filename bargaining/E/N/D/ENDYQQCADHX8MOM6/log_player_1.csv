"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and I'll take $8,000, which is 80% of the original amount. This way, we can end the game quickly and avoid further negotiations."
