"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finish the game quickly!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $6000 / 0.95 = $6315.79
* Bob gain: $4000 / 0.95 = $4210.53

My decision is:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I think I can do better than this!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""A bit more balanced this time. Consider it!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the current $9,500 (after inflation), and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Initial $10,000 * (1 - 0.1426) = $8,574.40
* Alice gain: $5,000 / 0.8574 = $5,825.45
* Bob gain: $5,000 / 0.8574 = $5,825.45

My decision is:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I think this is a fair offer, and it's getting late in the game!"
