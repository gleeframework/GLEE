"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While a 400,000$ gain is tempting, I want to see if I can get more. Let's see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but I think we can do better next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting closer to what I want, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round with her discounting my offer by 10%. Let's take the deal."
