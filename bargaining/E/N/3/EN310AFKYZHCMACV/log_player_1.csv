"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less with each round, I should aim to get a larger share now to compensate for the decrease in value.

I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a larger share now.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Given the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiation.

However, Bob's offer is still relatively close to the original 50/50 split. Considering the inflation, I'll take a calculated risk and accept this offer.
