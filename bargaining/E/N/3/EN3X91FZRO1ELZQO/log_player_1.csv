"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, let's start with a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more optimistic approach. Let's see if Alice is willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than before, so I need to be more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up $2000 more than I initially proposed. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round either.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
