I'm going to try and get as much as possible in the first round, since the money is worth more now than later. I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll take it to avoid the risk of getting nothing later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would like to get more, this offer is still significantly better than the risk of getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting offers. The inflation rate is impacting the value of the money, so it's wise to accept this offer before it gets even worse."
