"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a generous offer, considering I'm proposing a 70/30 split. Will Bob accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a slightly more even split. Will Bob accept?"
