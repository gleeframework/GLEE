"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront, but you lose less to inflation over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. Alice's proposal isn't fair enough, considering the inflation rates. I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. You lose more to inflation, so I've taken that into account.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer or I'm walking away with nothing for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation and Alice's message, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation of the money. It's not ideal, but it's a reasonable compromise."
