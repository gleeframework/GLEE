6000.0,4000.0,Let's start with a simple offer - 60/40 split. It's a good deal for you considering the inflation!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to split the money 55/45 in your favor, but I'm not going to give away more than that. Inflation is a factor for both of us, and I believe this is a fair compromise.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6400.0,3600.0,"I understand inflation affects us both, but your previous offer wasn't fair considering the difference in our devaluation rates.  I'm proposing 64/36 - it gets us closer to an agreement and still leaves you with a decent share.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4800.0,5200.0,"I'm willing to give you a little more to get this done.  52/48 is my final offer.  Inflation is hitting me hard, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6700.0,3300.0,"Bob, we're getting close to a point where this isn't worth it for me anymore. I need you to acknowledge the difference in inflation we're facing.  67/33 is my final offer.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, we're both losing more and more with each round.  Let's split the money evenly and call it a day.  This way, we both get something and avoid the risk of getting nothing at all.",Bob,6,
