"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual values are:

Alice gain: $570,000
Bob gain: $665,000

I'm not happy with this offer, as I think I deserve a larger share. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit more aggressive, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less than the original $1,000,000, the actual values are:

Alice gain: $343,500
Bob gain: $647,500

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I think I should take it. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with an even lower amount.
