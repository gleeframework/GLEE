"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take almost everything this round, but you'll have the chance to even things out next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to accept a small amount now in hopes of getting more later, it's too risky.  The inflation rate means the money I get in the next round will be worth significantly less. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
