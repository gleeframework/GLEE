"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting the value of the money, my gain of $5,000 in this round is actually worth $4,500 (10% less than the $6,000 I would have gotten in the first round).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with meeting in the middle, considering the value of the money is decreasing. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less in each round, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. Since I rejected the previous offer, I'll try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a fair share 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation, my gain of $5,200 in this round is actually worth $3,808 (27.1% less than the $6,000 I would have gotten in the first round).

I'm not sure if Bob is being sincere about giving me more, but I'll consider the offer. The difference between this offer and my previous one is $300, which is a relatively small amount considering the decreasing value of money.
