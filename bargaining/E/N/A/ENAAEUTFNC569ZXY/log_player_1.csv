"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll give you a decent share.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 20%. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's end this game now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round. I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, so I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
