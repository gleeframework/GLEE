It's painful, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **Inflation is killing me:** The value of the money is decreasing drastically for me each round. 
* **Alice is ruthless:** She knows I'm getting desperate, and she's exploiting it.
* **Next round is worse:** If I reject this, I'll be forced to accept even less in round 8 or get nothing at all. 

This is a classic example of how time preference and asymmetric information can lead to one party getting a much better deal in a negotiation."
