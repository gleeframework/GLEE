"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll consider the offer carefully. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the relative values.

I'll reject the offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal. Since Bob offered me 300,000 in the previous round, which is 30% of the initial amount, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll consider the offer carefully. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the relative values.

I'll accept the offer.
