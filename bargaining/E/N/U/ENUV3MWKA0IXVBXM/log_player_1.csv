I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in Round 3.
