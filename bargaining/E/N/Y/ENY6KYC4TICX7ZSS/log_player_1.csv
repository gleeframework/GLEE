"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your generosity but I think we can both do better.  Let's flip the script - I'm offering you 40 and taking 60. Remember, the money is losing value for you faster than for me. Let's be smart about this! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
