"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we both get $50. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'll consider it.

Since I'm getting 45, that's worth 80% of the original $50 I would have gotten in the first round (due to the 20% inflation). Bob's getting 55, which is worth 90% of the original $50 he would have gotten in the first round (due to the 10% inflation).

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Let's see if I can do better in the next round!
