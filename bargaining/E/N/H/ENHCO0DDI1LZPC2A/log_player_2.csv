Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has consistently offered deals where she gets the larger share. While my previous offers have been rejected, the impact of inflation is becoming severe. Accepting Alice's offer in Round 5, while not ideal, is better than risking a worse offer or no deal in future rounds. 

**Here's why:**

* **Inflation:** My potential gains are decreasing significantly with each round.
* **Alice's Pattern:** Alice seems firm in getting a larger share and her offer acknowledges the inflation impact (though minimally).
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in future rounds, and the risk of getting even less is high."
