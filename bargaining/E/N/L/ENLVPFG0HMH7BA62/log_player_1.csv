"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$ and keeping 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of 50 is worth 80% of the original 60, which is 48. And Bob's gain of 50 is worth 90% of the original 40, which is 36.

I think this is a reasonable compromise, so I'll accept the offer.
