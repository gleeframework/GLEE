Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If Bob accepts, I get most of the money. If he rejects, we'll see how the game unfolds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and the risk of continuing the game is too high.  I'd rather get half the money now than risk getting nothing later!"
