"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $100,000. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll think it's a good starting point and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair starting point. We can always adjust things later if we want. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting the offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual value of the money in the current round. In this case, my gain of $500,000 is worth 95% of the original value, which is $475,000, and Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth 90% of the original value, which is $450,000.

While Bob's offer seems fair, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain is worth 90% of the previous value, which is $0.95 * $475,000 = $447,500.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $300,000, Bob. It's a good compromise, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller amount, but I'm still trying to negotiate a deal that benefits me more."
