I'm going for a very large share, but I'm willing to give Bob a tiny bit to make sure he doesn't reject the offer outright. 
Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have more, I can't afford to be greedy in this situation. Accepting this offer means we both get a decent amount of money, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round with the effects of inflation."
