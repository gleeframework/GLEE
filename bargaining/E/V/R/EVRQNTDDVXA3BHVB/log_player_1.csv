"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need for negotiations.""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal of a 50/50 split."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 90% of $5000, which is $4500 in real terms. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of $5000, which is $5700 in real terms.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 60/40 split, especially since I'm getting a smaller real gain than in the previous round. I'll reject this offer.
