"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'm willing to give you a good deal. Accept this and we can both walk away with a nice sum.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the initial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, but I think we can both do better. I'm willing to give you a good chunk of the money, but I need to secure a bit more for myself.  Let's see if we can find a fair split that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob's offer is the same as my initial offer, but with the money amounts adjusted for inflation. Since I'm not getting a better deal than my initial offer, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I need to secure a decent amount for myself to make this worth my while.""
}
```"
