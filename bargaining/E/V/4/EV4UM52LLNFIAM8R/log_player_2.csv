Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting tired of this game.  This is my final offer.  You know I'm willing to give you something, but you need to understand that each round only makes your share worth less. Take it or we both walk away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less my share is worth due to inflation. Waiting any longer risks getting an even worse offer or even walking away with nothing.
* **Alice's Resolve:** Her language suggests she's unwilling to budge further.  She's called her bluff twice now, and there's a real chance she'll follow through.
* **Something is Better than Nothing:** While $50,000 is significantly less than what I aimed for, it's still a considerable sum. Rejecting this offer risks walking away with absolutely nothing. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting is the most rational choice in this scenario."
