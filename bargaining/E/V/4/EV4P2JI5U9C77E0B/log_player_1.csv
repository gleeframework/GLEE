"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
``` 
I propose a 51/49 split in my favor.  I figure it's a fair starting point given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a larger share, it's not worth risking the chance of getting nothing at all due to inflation.  Accepting the offer is the more sensible choice."
