Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical. This offer gives us both a decent share, considering the shrinking value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
This round, it's important to recognize that continued stalling is hurting both of us. While not ideal, Bob's offer of $600,000 is still better than what we could get if we continue to disagree and let inflation eat away at the potential gains."
