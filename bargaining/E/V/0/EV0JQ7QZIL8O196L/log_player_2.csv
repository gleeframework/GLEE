This is getting very tight, but I need to hold my nerve. Accepting now would mean a huge loss compared to the potential winnings. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. Let's see what she offers next round - it's her turn to sweat a little."

This is brutal, but I can't accept that offer.  With the inflation, I'm losing so much every round that it's worth the gamble to push it to the very end. Alice is clearly enjoying this, but she's going to have to give me something better, or we both lose."

This is it, the final straw.  Alice is clearly going to push me all the way. If I reject this, I risk getting nothing at all in the final round. Accepting a 32/68 split feels awful, but it's better than walking away empty-handed after all this."
