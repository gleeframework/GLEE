Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take 9000 dollars and leave 1000 dollars for Bob. I'm hoping for a quick agreement, as I'm aware of the inflation, and want to secure the majority of the money before it loses value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, taking 5000 is better than risking getting nothing due to inflation. This is a fair split, and I don't want to push my luck further."
