Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, Alice. Take it or leave it. This is your last chance for a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Let's analyze why rejecting is the better strategy here:

* **Current Offer:** Bob offers me $30, leaving him with $70. Due to inflation, my real gain is significantly less. 
* **Next Round:** If I reject, I get to propose in the next round. While the total value decreases, I can aim for a more favorable split, even with the inflation. 

Bob's threatening tone suggests he might be overplaying his hand. By rejecting, I maintain a chance for a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer gives us both a reasonable share considering the inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  This is our last chance to agree before inflation significantly erodes the value.
* **Strategic Retreat:** I'm stepping back from the 60/40 split, acknowledging the time pressure on me. 
* **Fairness Appeal:**  By framing it as ""realistic,"" I'm implying that my offer is a fair compromise given the circumstances.

I believe this offer has a good chance of acceptance as it presents a tangible benefit for Bob compared to risking further inflation."
