"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, and leave 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, I'll try to get an even larger share to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15
}
```

I'm offering to take 85% of the remaining $100, leaving 15% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the actual value of the offer in Round 1 to compare with Bob's offer in Round 4.

In Round 1, my gain was $80, which is worth 80% of $100. In Round 4, my gain is worth 51.2% of the original $100 (80% * 0.64).

So, Bob's offer of $75 is equivalent to 60% of the original $100 (75 / 1.24), which is more than my original gain in Round 1.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
