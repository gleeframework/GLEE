Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was too low. Let's be fair, I'll take the larger share this time considering the inflation working against me. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
