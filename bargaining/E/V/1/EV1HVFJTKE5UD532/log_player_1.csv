"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us receiving $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a bit greedy last round, let's be a bit more generous this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the 20% decrease in my gain, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me $4,000 when I was initially hoping for $5,000. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much!""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly smaller share than my initial proposal, but still a bit more generous than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but you have to meet me halfway now! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway. His offer is not ideal, but it's a decent compromise.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that the reduced value of the money will be offset by the fact that we're finally reaching a deal."
