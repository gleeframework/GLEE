"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as needed.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be fair, but I think I can do better. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I don't want to give up too much, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider Bob's offer. If I accept, I'll get $50, which is 50% of the remaining value.
