Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic.  I propose a more equitable split that acknowledges my position in the game. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
