Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I understand you want a bigger share, but I'm not going to be exploited. This is a fair 50/50 split, and I believe it's in both our best interests to agree. If we keep going, the value of the money decreases for me, and we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
