Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 50-50, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll offer a slightly biased deal.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still biased towards her, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll compare the absolute values.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal than the one I made in round 2.
