"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I understand Bob's concern about inflation. Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more aggressive proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much. This is my best offer.""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is still a relatively fair deal considering the reduced value of money due to inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
