"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000, which is a relatively equal split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a significant amount, but I think I deserve more for taking on the risk of negotiating with you! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for Bob, he's now getting $4,800 (6000 * 0.8) and I'm getting $4,000. I'm not thrilled about the proposal, but it's a better offer than the first one. I'll accept this offer.
