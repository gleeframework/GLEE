"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$.  This feels like a fair starting point, and it gives Bob a chance to benefit from the game's inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly to account for the ongoing inflation, but I'm still proposing a significantly larger portion for myself. I believe this offer is fair given the dynamic of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer to have more, this offer is significantly better than the last one.  The inflation is making it difficult to maintain a large share, and accepting this offer ensures I get some money before the game progresses further."
