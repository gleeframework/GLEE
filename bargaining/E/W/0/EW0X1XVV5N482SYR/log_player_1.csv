"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe a more equitable split is in our best interest.  Let's split it down the middle after accounting for inflation -  5250 for me, and 4750 for you. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
