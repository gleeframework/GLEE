"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's be even! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is actually worth 80% of its original value, which is $4000.

I'm not sure I want to meet Bob halfway, especially since the money is worth less and less with each round. I'd rather try to negotiate for more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is still affecting the value of the money, I'll try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me at 55-45, I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a compromise. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you a small amount 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on the value of the money! With the 48.8% reduction, my gain of $3000 is actually worth around $1584 in the original value.

I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but I'm not sure I want to risk going to the next round either. The value of the money will continue to decrease, and I might end up with even less.
