Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking almost everything, knowing that Bob will be heavily penalized for each round that passes. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm only getting $1000, it's better than getting nothing if we go another round. The inflation is much harsher on Bob, and I'm sure he'll be more willing to compromise next time!"
