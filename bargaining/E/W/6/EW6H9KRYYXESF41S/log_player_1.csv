"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose that I get $90 and Bob gets $10.  This gives me the majority of the money, but I want to make sure Bob has some incentive to accept the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in the later rounds.  The inflation is likely to make the future offers less favorable."
