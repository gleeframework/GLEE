"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split in my favor, with me getting $9,000 and Bob getting $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure what's fair, but I'll give you a small share.  Next round, you can make the offer. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $1,000 is now worth $900.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round, considering the reduced value of money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value. Since the money is worth 10% less than the previous round, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800,
  ""bob_gain"": 9200,
  ""message"": ""Considering the reduced value of money, I'm willing to give you a larger share this round. But I'm still looking for a good deal.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a 8-92 split, with me getting $800 and Bob getting $9,200."
