,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I appreciate your fairness, but I believe a 60-40 split in my favor is more appropriate. Let's start with this, and we can adjust it in the next round if needed.",Bob,2,

580000.0,420000.0,"I see you think 60-40 is fair, but in your favor. How about we meet in the middle, 58-42? It's a good compromise.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm still aiming for a 65-35 split. It reflects the value of our respective contributions to this negotiation. Let's see if we can reach a deal this round.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
570000.0,430000.0,"I see you're still pushing for a bigger share. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about 57-43? It's getting closer to your desired split.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but with inflation eroding our gains, I need to secure a larger share. Let's try 70-30. This is my final offer before the value of the money drops further.",Bob,6,

560000.0,440000.0,"I see you're getting anxious about the inflation, but I'm not willing to give up that much. I'll compromise a bit more, 56-44. It's the most I'm willing to budge. Think carefully, the value is dropping fast.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
250000.0,750000.0,"We're running out of time, and the inflation is hitting hard.  I need to secure a bigger share to make this worthwhile.  This is my final offer, 75-25. It's a significant compromise on my part, but it's the best we can do with the remaining time.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I understand the pressure, but I won't accept such an uneven split. I'll make one last compromise, 55-45. If you reject, I'm willing to walk away and we'll both get nothing.",Alice,9,

200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, we're at a critical juncture.  I'm willing to offer 80-20.  This is my absolute final offer.  If we fail to reach an agreement, we both lose everything.  Consider this carefully, as the next round will leave us with even less.",Bob,10,
