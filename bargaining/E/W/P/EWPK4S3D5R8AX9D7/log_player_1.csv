"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get a slightly better deal for myself. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fair split, with me getting the larger share since I am the one making the offer this round. Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me this round, I'll be getting $400,000 x 0.8 = $320,000.

I don't think it's fair that Bob is trying to get the larger share just because he made the offer this round. I'd rather wait for a better offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me this round, I'll be getting 20% of the original amount, which is $1,000,000 x 0.2 = $200,000. I'll try to get a better deal this round.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself."
