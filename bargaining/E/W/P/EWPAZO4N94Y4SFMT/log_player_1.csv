"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but you can't get away with 60% 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, and Bob is trying to take advantage of that.

I'll reject this offer because I think it's too skewed towards Bob. I'd like a fairer split, considering the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take advantage of inflation, but I'll still give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a fair deal. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really eating away at the value of the money!

I'll reject this offer because it's still way too skewed towards Bob. I'm not getting a fair share, and I need to be more cautious with each passing round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, it's getting late and we're running out of time""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable deal, considering the reduced value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
