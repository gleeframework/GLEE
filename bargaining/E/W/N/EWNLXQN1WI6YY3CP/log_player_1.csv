"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start fair, so I'll offer a slight bias towards me this time. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer that's more in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 5% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more than last time.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly more favorable split this time, considering the inflation is eating away at my potential gains. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give up much more. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 10-90 split, but I'm getting desperate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd rather not accept such an unfavorable split, but I'm not sure what to do next. Maybe I should try to negotiate again?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really hurting me now!

Here's my new offer, taking into account the 14.26% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of options, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm trying to salvage what's left, but I'm not sure how much longer I can keep going."
