Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split since we're both losing money. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Bob is framing his offer as fair, he's benefiting significantly from my loss to inflation. Accepting this deal would mean I lose a large chunk of the potential gain. I need to hold out for a better offer, even if it means risking further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
