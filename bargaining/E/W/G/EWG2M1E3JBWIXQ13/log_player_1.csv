I'm going to start with a pretty lopsided offer.  I want to see how Bob responds and how willing he is to risk losing more money by rejecting my offer.  Since I'm going first, I want to secure the most I can before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very greedy!  I'm going to reject this offer. I'm hoping the inflation will bite him back harder than it does me in the next round. I'm not going to be taken advantage of like that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try to make a more fair offer this time, but I still want a larger share.  I'm going to assume that Bob learned his lesson about being too greedy. I'm going to keep in mind that the inflation rate is higher for me, so I need to secure a decent amount before it erodes my potential gains further."
