"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob 4000, which is 40% of the initial amount. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're just starting out and we don't know each other's negotiation styles yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is symmetrical, it's a fair split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Considering the inflation, the money is worth less than before, and I'd like to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Maybe I can get a better deal by waiting.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal this time, while still being reasonable. I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get. Considering the inflation, the money is worth less than before, and I'd like to get a better deal.

However, I'm starting to run out of rounds, and Bob's offer is getting more reasonable. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I won't regret it later.
