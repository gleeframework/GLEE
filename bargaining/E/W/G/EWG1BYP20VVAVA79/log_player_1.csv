"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm giving Bob a decent chunk of the money upfront. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'm now considering the value of the money I'd gain, which remains the same as in the first round, and the value of the money Bob would gain, which is 10% less than in the first round.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, as I'd be giving up a significant amount of money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was for 90% of the money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'm taking a slightly smaller share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the value of Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him. Since I'm considering the value of the money I'd gain, which remains the same as in the first round, and the value of the money Bob would gain, which is 27.1% less than in the first round, I think this offer is a bit too generous towards Bob.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was for 70% of the money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'm taking a smaller share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000

Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the value of Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him. Considering the value of the money I'd gain, which remains the same as in the first round, and the value of the money Bob would gain, which is 40.95% less than in the first round, I think this offer is still too generous towards Bob.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
