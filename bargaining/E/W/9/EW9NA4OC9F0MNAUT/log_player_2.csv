Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere fast.  I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but we need to close this deal before inflation eats away at the value. 55/45 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
