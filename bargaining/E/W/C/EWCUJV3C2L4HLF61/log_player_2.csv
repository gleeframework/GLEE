"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take 100,000 and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. The current offer of $100,000 is too low, considering the total amount is $1,000,000. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make my proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a more reasonable offer, considering the total amount and the fact that Alice was willing to give me $100,000 initially.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping she'll see the sense in compromising, given the looming threat of inflation devaluing our potential gains."
