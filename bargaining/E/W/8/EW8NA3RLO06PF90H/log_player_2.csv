Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  Inflation is only going to hurt us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve more than half 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a bit more, the effects of inflation are starting to become significant. Accepting $45 now is worth considerably less than it was in Round 1. It's worth holding out a bit longer to see if we can get closer to an even split, or at least an offer where the impact of inflation is less severe."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""How about this? I'm taking a slight hit from a perfect split to make this work. We need to settle this soon.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, considering the inflation is only affecting you 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The impact of inflation is becoming severe. Accepting $47 now is significantly less than what it was worth in Round 1, but waiting any longer is very risky.  Alice seems insistent on getting more than half. If the game goes to round 8 or beyond, the effects of inflation will be even more drastic, and we risk getting even less or nothing at all."
