Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. This is a fair deal for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous. 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing, Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. Holding out for a better offer in the next round is still the better strategy. It's unlikely Alice will let the game continue to a point where she receives nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a decent deal considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out and the value of the money is steadily decreasing for Bob.  While not ideal, accepting a slightly smaller share than Alice is the most rational decision at this point.  The message is designed to convey a sense of urgency and finality, pushing Alice to accept rather than risk getting nothing in a future round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, this is getting worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point. While the offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means risking an even lower amount in the next round due to the increasing inflation. Alice is clearly exploiting the situation, and further refusal will likely lead to her offering even less. Accepting now cuts the losses and ensures Bob receives something, even if it's significantly reduced from the initial potential."
