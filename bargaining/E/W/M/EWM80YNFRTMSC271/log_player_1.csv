"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more even this time.  I'm willing to take a slight loss to get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to be more even, but he's still getting a bigger share than me!

I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with an even better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 10% less for Bob (5% less from round 1 and 5% less from round 2), I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share than before, but I'm still trying to be reasonable. Let's see if he'll accept!"
