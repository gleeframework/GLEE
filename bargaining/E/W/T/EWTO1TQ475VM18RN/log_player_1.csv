"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""Let's start fair. I'll take 90, you get 10. It's a good start, and we can negotiate from there.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, and I'll take 60. It's a good middle ground, and we can still negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it's still not a fair split considering the inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that.  Let's split it 70/30, giving me 70 and you 30.  We're both losing value with each round, so let's make a move towards a fair outcome.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think 55 is too much. How about 45 for me and 55 for you? We're getting closer to a fair split, but I still want to get a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation is becoming a significant factor. It's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting this deal ensures I get a decent portion and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
