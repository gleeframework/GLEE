  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to make you want to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair, Alice. Let's call it a day and avoid any further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,500 (90% of $5,000).

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

}
```

# Bob gain: 4500
