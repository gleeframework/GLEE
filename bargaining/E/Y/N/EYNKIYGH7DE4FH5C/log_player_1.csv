  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 40% of the money. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the money, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

In this case, I'll get $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount, and Bob will get $700,000, which is 70% of the original amount.

Considering that I'm getting a smaller share, I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much. Take it or leave it.""

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation.

In this case, I'll get $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount, and Bob will get $800,000, which is 80% of the original amount.

Considering that I'm getting an even smaller share than before, and Bob's offer is his ""final"" one, I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original $1,000,000.

In this case, I'll get $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount, and Bob will get $900,000, which is 90% of the original amount.

Considering that I'm getting an extremely small share, and Bob's offer is his ""final"" one, I'll decide to reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

However, I should note that if I reject this offer, the game will continue indefinitely, and the value of the money will continue to decrease due to inflation. I might want to reconsider and accept this offer to get some amount of money, even if it's a small one."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 90% of the original amount, I'll aim for an even better share this time.

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to let you walk away with the majority of the money. Take it or leave it.""

# Bob's message: I'm not going to give you anything. I'm taking it all. 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the final round, and Bob is taking the entire amount. Considering that the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation, and I won't get any amount, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

However, since I've rejected this offer, the game will continue indefinitely, and the value of the money will continue to decrease. This is a classic example of the problem of infinite regress, where the game will never reach a conclusion."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to take the entire amount, I'll make a proposal that will ensure I get at least some amount of money, even if it's a very small one.

Here's my proposal for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1,
  ""bob_gain"": 999999,
  ""message"": ""I'll take whatever I can get at this point. You're taking everything else.""
}
```

This way, I'll get $1, and Bob will get the remaining $999,999."
