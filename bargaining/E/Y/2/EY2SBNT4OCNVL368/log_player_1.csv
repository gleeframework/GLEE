"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice, considering the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I understand your concerns about inflation, a more even split is fairer considering the potential for both of us to lose money as the game progresses. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
