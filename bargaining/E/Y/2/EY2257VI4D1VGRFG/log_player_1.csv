"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $8000 and you get $2000. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you can do better than that. I'll start with a more aggressive offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take a bigger share, huh?

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I'll accept this offer. I'd rather wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. $7000 for me and $3000 for you. Let's find a middle ground.""
}
```

I'm offering a bit more to Bob than in my first offer, but still trying to maintain a balance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up yet. I want more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a compromise, but still wants a bigger share.

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
