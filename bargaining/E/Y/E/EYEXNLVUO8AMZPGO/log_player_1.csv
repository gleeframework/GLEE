"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 70 dollars and Bob gets 30 dollars. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 40:60, a good compromise! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that 40:60 is a good compromise for me. I was hoping for a more even split. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50:50!""}

I'm proposing a 50:50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise."
