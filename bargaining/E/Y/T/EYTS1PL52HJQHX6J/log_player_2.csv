"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting both of us. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but 55/45 is still too much in your favor. This offer ensures we both secure a decent share before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800
