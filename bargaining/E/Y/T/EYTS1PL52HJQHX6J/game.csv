6000.0,4000.0,Let's be reasonable and split the money 60/40. A deal now is better than risking inflation eating away at our potential gains.,Alice,1,

4500.0,5500.0,"I understand the need to act quickly against inflation, but your initial offer was too unbalanced. I propose a 55/45 split. It's a fair offer considering the inflation rate affects me more.",Bob,2,

5800.0,4200.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting both of us. I'm willing to compromise slightly, but 55/45 is still too much in your favor. This offer ensures we both secure a decent share before inflation eats away at it further.",Alice,3,
