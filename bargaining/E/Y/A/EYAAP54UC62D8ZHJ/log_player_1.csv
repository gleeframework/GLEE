"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $200,000, and I'll take $800,000. You can do better than this?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's a good starting point. We can negotiate from here. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll keep my gains in mind in terms of the original $1,000,000.

In this offer, I would gain $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. That's a significant decrease from my initial offer of $800,000. Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I think this is a reasonable offer.

I'll accept this offer.
