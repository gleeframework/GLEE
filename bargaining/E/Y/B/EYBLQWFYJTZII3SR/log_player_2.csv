"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a little more this time, Bob.  But it's still a fair deal, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting worse with each round due to inflation, but it's still better than risking another round and potentially getting an even worse offer."
