"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I want 60 for my efforts! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already biting! My gain is worth 20% less, but I still need to make a decision.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new proposal. With inflation, my gain is worth 40% less than the initial $100. I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decreasing value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Take 40, I'll take 60. It's a fair deal, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise, take 45, and I'll get 55. It's a better deal than last time! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money worth 48.8% less, I need to be cautious.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time. 45 is a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk going to Round 5 with the value of money decreasing even further.
