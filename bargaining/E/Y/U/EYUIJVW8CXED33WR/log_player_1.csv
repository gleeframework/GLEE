"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 90% and you get 10% to get us started. Let's play it safe!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split to get us started. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for Bob, his offer is actually:

```
# Bob's gain: 480,000
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. It's a fair split, and I'd rather get 400,000 than risk going to the next round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
