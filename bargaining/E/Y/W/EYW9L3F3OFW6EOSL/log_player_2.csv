"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 7500 for her and 2500 for me, I'll try to counter with a slightly better offer for myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 3000, ""alice_gain"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is still skewed in her favor, but the inflation has made my gain slightly more attractive. I'll consider it, but I'm not ready to accept yet.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is taking its toll, and the money is worth less and less. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the reduced value. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Alice is trying to make a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if she's willing to accept a similar split in the next round. I'll take a chance and accept her offer, hoping that she'll be willing to compromise in future rounds.
