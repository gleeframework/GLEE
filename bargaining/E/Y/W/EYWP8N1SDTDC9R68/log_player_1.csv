I'm going to start with a slightly uneven split, giving myself 90 dollars and Bob 10. I figure this gives me a good starting point, but I'm also willing to negotiate if he rejects the offer.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous proposal, the inflation factor makes it less appealing.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground this time.  I'm reducing my share to 55 dollars, and offering Bob 45.  With inflation affecting both of us, I'm hoping this offer is fair enough for him to accept."
