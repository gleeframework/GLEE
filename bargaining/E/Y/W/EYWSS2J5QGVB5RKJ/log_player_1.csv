"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60/40 in my favor, which is a relatively fair split considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing!

Considering the new values, I'd be gaining 40 * 0.8 = 32 (since my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round) and Bob would gain 60 * 0.95 = 57 (since Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob!""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor, trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I think I'm getting a better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse!

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain would be 45 * 0.512 (since my gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which is 100% - 48.8% = 51.2% of the original value) = 22.96

Bob's gain would be 55 * 0.857 (since Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which is 100% - 14.26% = 85.74% of the original value) = 47.19

Considering the values, I think this offer is not that bad for me, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game is getting intense!

Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll try to make an even more aggressive offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob!""
}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, trying to take advantage of the rapidly decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 50, let's just split it down the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting out of control!

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain would be 50 * 0.325 (since my gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, which is 100% - 67.23% = 32.77% of the original value) = 16.25

Bob's gain would be 50 * 0.772 (since Bob's gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, which is 100% - 22.62% = 77.38% of the original value) = 38.6

Considering the values, I think this offer is a decent compromise, and I'm not sure if I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
