"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share. I know inflation is a factor, but I'm hoping to secure most of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than I wanted in the first round, the inflation factor is making it risky to keep rejecting offers. I'm better off securing some of the money now, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
