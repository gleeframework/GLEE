Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep the vast majority of the money for myself, offering Bob a small token amount. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. If Bob accepts, I win big. If he rejects, we move on to the next round, and the value of the money will decrease, but I will have the opportunity to make a new proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation makes it risky to keep rejecting offers. Accepting Bob's proposal ensures we both receive a significant amount, and it avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
