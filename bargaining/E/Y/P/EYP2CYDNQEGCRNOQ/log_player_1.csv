Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to try to get the most money possible, but I'm also aware of the inflation risk. I'll see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more than 50%,  inflation is a real risk.  It's better to secure a guaranteed 50% now than risk getting less later."
