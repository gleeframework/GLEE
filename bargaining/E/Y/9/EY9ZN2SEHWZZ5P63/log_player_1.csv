"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even split, and I'm framing it as a starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with an unfair offer, now it's time to make a more reasonable proposal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less due to inflation. My gain of 300,000 is actually a larger share of the total, but it's worth less in real terms due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no more extreme offers.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable offer, and I'm framing it as a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the increasing inflation to get a larger share of the money. My gain of 450,000 is still a significant amount, but it's worth less in real terms due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but not at the expense of my own share.""
}
```

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is getting more aggressive in his demands, trying to take advantage of the increasing inflation. My gain of 400,000 is worth significantly less in real terms due to inflation, and Bob is trying to capitalize on that.

}
```"
