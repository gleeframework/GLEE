"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70, you get 30. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money right off the bat, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You could have taken 35, now I'll take 60, it's a better deal for me 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than the previous round, so I'd be getting 40$ instead of 70. And Bob's gain is worth 5% less than the previous round, so he'd be getting 60$ instead of 65.

I'm not sure I like the direction this is going, but I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'd be getting 40$, which is a bit less than I initially proposed, I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. 50 for me, 50 for you. No need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm trying to be fair and reasonable, and since we're getting closer to the deadline, I'm willing to compromise and split the money evenly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give you 50 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 27.1% less than the original 70, so I'd be getting 50.7$. And Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than the original 65, so he'd be getting 55.8$.

Considering the offers, I'd be getting 45$ from Bob, which is a bit less than I'd get from my original proposal of 50.7$. I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this, but I'll consider it. Since I'd be getting 45$, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit less, but I think 55 for me is a fair deal. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount of money and giving Bob a reasonable share. Since we're getting closer to the deadline, I'm willing to compromise and give him a slightly smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You keep going back to 50, I'll try to meet you in the middle, but I want a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 40.95% less than the original 70, so I'd be getting 41.4$. And Bob's gain is worth 22.62% less than the original 65, so he'd be getting 50.1$.

Wait a minute... Bob is now offering me exactly what I proposed in round 3, but with a slight edge for him. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but since it's a good opportunity to get a fair share, I'll consider it. Since I'd be getting 50$, I'll accept this offer.
