"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, and I was initially offered $60, I'll now be getting $54 (60% of $90, since $100 x 0.9 = $90).

Similarly, since the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, and he was initially offered $40, he'll now be getting $32 (60% of $80, since $100 x 0.8 = $80).

Considering this, I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer. I'd like to propose a new offer in Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100, which is $55, and Bob gets the remaining 45%, which is $45."
