"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the total amount, while I'll take $600,000, which is 60%. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it. Let me know what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn, let's see what you think is fair now.  
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because, considering the inflation, Bob's gain is actually worth less than what I offered him in the previous round, while my gain is less than what I would have gotten if he had accepted my initial offer. I think I can do better, so I'll reject and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than my first offer""}\n\nSince Bob's gain is worth 20% less each round, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect that. I'm now offering him $350,000, which, considering the inflation, is actually a better deal for him than my initial offer of $400,000. Meanwhile, I'll take $650,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my last offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm accepting this offer because, considering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's gain, I don't think I can get a better deal. With Bob's gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, his $400,000 is actually worth much less than what I initially offered him. Meanwhile, I'll still get $600,000, which is the same as my initial proposal. Since Bob says this is his last offer, I don't want to risk losing this opportunity, so I'll accept it.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
