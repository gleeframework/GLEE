Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  The inflation is affecting both of us, so I propose we split the money evenly. This way we both get something, and we avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
