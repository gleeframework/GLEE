"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm essentially getting 80% of the original value. Meanwhile, Bob's offer would give me 300,000, which is only 30% of the original value.

Considering the disparity in the values, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer, taking a slightly larger share of the pie, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another round!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, Bob's offer is actually a relatively good one. I'm getting 40% of the original value, which is a decent share.

However, I'm not convinced that I should settle for this offer just yet. I'll try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm trying to make a slightly more aggressive offer again, taking an even larger share of the pie, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
