"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bit more since I'm taking the risk of the money being worth less in the next round.""}\n\nLet's see what Alice thinks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. We both have equal chance of making a better deal in the next round, but we're both losing money with each round.  Let's cut our losses and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the money is worth less with each passing round, I think it's best to accept this offer and split the money down the middle. Waiting for a better offer in the next round might not be worth the risk of losing even more value."
