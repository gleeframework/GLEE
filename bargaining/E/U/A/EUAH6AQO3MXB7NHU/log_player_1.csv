"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not convinced that I should accept it. I was hoping for a more even split, and 70-30 is still a significant difference. I'm willing to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent chunk too""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground, so I'm offering 55 dollars to myself and 45 dollars to Bob. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm getting worried about the inflation 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting a bit concerned about the inflation too!

After considering Bob's offer, I'm tempted to accept it. The 75-25 split is still not ideal, but it's getting closer to a more even split. I'm also worried that if I reject this offer, the inflation might make the money worth even less, and we might end up with nothing.
