"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $4000 and keep $6000 for myself.""
}
```

This offer is a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45% share, especially since the money I gain is now worth 5% less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split the money 50/50. It's a fair compromise, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal for myself."
