"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is incredibly unfair, and while there's a lot of money at stake, Bob has 11 more rounds to try and get a better deal.  It's too risky to accept such a small share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. I'm offering you a fair share, and we can both walk away happy.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think my initial offer was fair.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement this round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is much better than the first round, Bob is still getting a much smaller share.  There's a good chance that Alice will continue to make offers that are more favorable to her, so Bob should keep rejecting until he gets a better deal.  He still has plenty of rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  We both need to compromise to get a fair deal.  I'm offering you a 50/50 split.  This way, we both walk away with a good amount.""}
