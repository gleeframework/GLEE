900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair but generous split.  I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I'm not comfortable with such an unequal split.  Let's try a more even 60/40, with me getting 60% and you getting 40%.  I believe this is a fairer starting point for us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"Okay, let's compromise.  I'll take 70% and you get 30%.  This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the effects of inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,Let's split it down the middle.  50/50 is fair and avoids further losses due to inflation. It's time to end this game and get our share!,Bob,4,
