"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40, and I'll get 60. What do you say?""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you get 40. It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to account for the inflation. 55 for me, 45 for you. Is it a deal?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but I still want to get a good share of the money!"
