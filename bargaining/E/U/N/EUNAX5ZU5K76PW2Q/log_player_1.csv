"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial offer was quite low.  Let's be realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Time is money, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
