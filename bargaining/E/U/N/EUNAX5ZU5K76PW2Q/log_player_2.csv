Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, that initial offer was quite low.  Let's be realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Time is money, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. ""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money.  We both have an equal chance of proposing a deal in the future, so let's not let the potential for inflation create unnecessary conflict.   
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
