"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think a 60/40 split is a good place to begin. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more fair. Let's see what you think.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll offer 55/45, since you rejected my initial offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, with inflation, it's not a terrible deal. Let's end this!"
