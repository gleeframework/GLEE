"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to try to get him to accept the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gain for both of us considering the inflation:

My gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250 (since my gain is worth 20% less)
Bob's gain: 5000 / 0.95 = 5263 (since Bob's gain is worth 5% less)

I don't think this is a very good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll reject the offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Take this deal and we can avoid further negotiations!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the money closer to even, but still recognize the different inflation rates we're facing. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gain for both of us considering the inflation:

My gain: 5500 / 0.5208 = 10545.88 (since my gain is worth 48.8% less)
Bob's gain: 4500 / 0.8586 = 5230.23 (since Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less)

I think this offer is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'll accept the offer.
