"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split the money fairly, Bob. I propose we each take a significant amount, ensuring we both benefit.  This way, we avoid the risk of inflation eroding its value over multiple rounds. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's proposal is tempting, it's worth considering the inflation factor.  Since Alice's offer gives her more money, she stands to lose less due to inflation than I do.  It's in my best interest to try and negotiate a better deal, especially since I have the next turn."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. Since I'm proposing this round, I'm suggesting a slightly different split where I take slightly more to account for the inflation we both face. We can both still come out ahead, and avoid the risk of further devaluation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. Let's be practical. A 50/50 split ensures we both walk away with a significant sum and avoids further losses due to inflation. It's the fairest solution. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the 50/50 split offers a fair and practical solution.  Given the risk of further inflation and the potential for a stalemate, accepting this offer seems like the best course of action."
