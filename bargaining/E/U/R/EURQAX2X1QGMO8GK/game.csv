475000.0,525000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can do better. Since I'm proposing this round, I'm suggesting a slightly different split where I take slightly more to account for the inflation we both face. We can both still come out ahead, and avoid the risk of further devaluation.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, it seems we're at an impasse. Let's be practical. A 50/50 split ensures we both walk away with a significant sum and avoids further losses due to inflation. It's the fairest solution.",Alice,3,
