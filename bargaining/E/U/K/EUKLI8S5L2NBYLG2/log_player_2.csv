"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair deal, where I get the majority, but you get a small share.  This way, we both benefit! 
# Bob gain: 5 
# Alice gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, we both get a good share""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to split the money evenly, since we're both losing value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Understand the current offer
Alice is offering an even split of $100, with each of us getting $50.

### Step 2: Consider the effect of inflation
For Alice, the money is worth 9.75% less than in the first round due to inflation. This means her $50 is actually worth less in real terms.

### Step 3: Evaluate the fairness of the offer
Given that the money's value is decreasing for Alice but not for me, an even split might not be as even as it seems. However, considering we're in round 3 and the pressure to reach an agreement before the 12 rounds are over, this could be a reasonable compromise.

### Step 4: Decide on the offer
Given the decreasing value of money for Alice and the time pressure, accepting this offer seems reasonable to avoid further devaluation and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
