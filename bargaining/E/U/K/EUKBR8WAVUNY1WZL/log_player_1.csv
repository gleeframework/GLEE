"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was initially.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to round 2. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, hoping he'll accept this time!"
