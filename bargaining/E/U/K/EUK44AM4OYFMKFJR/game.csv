8000.0,2000.0,"I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but I still need a good chunk of the money.  We both know the inflation hurts me more than you. Let's make a deal before it gets too late.",Alice,3,

7000.0,3000.0,"This is my final offer.  Inflation is really starting to hurt now, and if we don't reach an agreement soon, we'll both lose a lot.  Let's be reasonable and settle this.",Alice,5,
