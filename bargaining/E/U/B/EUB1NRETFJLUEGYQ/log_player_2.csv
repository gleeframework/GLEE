"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it close to 50/50, considering the inflation risk I'm taking. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a good starting point, but I'm not willing to take such a big hit right away. I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more than a 50/50 split, but I'm not comfortable with the inflation risk you're taking. Let's see if we can find a compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more than a 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is closer to what I'm looking for, and the inflation risk is starting to become more significant. I'll take the offer."
