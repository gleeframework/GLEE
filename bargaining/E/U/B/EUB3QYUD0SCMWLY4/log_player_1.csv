Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'm open to negotiation""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm also leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I don't want to risk going to another round and losing more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer.
