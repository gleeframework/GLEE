"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by being generous, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm aware of the inflation risk, but I believe I can still secure a good portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, I believe I can still get a larger share. It's risky, but I'm not ready to give up yet.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. The inflation is increasing, and it's getting more risky with each passing round.  I believe this offer is reasonable, and Bob may be willing to accept it before the risk of inflation gets too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is significantly better than the previous round, I'm still holding out for a larger share. The inflation is getting very serious, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal, especially considering Bob is taking a big loss due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

The inflation is getting out of control, and I need to take a more aggressive approach. This offer is still quite favorable for me, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the risk of losing even more money due to inflation.  It's a gamble, but it's the best way to secure a decent amount before the money becomes worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is more appealing than the previous rounds, I still believe that I can negotiate a better deal. The inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me, and I'm confident I can leverage that to secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is escalating rapidly, and it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  I'm proposing an even split, recognizing that we both are suffering from inflation.  It's time to settle for a compromise and avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
