"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate further if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. My message to Bob is that I'm starting with a fair split and we can negotiate further if he wants to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll calculate my gain accordingly. My gain of $450,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually $405,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is still a bit too skewed towards him, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to propose a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, the money is worth 90% of its original value now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's see if we can find a better split""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $550,000 and Bob gets $450,000, which is a 50-50 split. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to meet him halfway and see if we can find a better split."
