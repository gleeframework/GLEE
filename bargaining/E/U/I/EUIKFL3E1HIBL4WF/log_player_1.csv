"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, giving myself 900,000 dollars and Bob 100,000 dollars. I believe this is a fair offer, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although this offer is much less than what I initially proposed, accepting it is the best option given the inflation. It's better to secure 200,000 dollars now than risk losing everything by continuing to reject offers and facing further inflation."
