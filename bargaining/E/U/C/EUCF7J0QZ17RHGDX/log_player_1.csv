"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this case, Bob's offer is equivalent to a 40/60 split, with me getting $4,000 and Bob getting $6,000.

I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a decent share""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, with me getting $4,500 and Bob getting $5,500."
