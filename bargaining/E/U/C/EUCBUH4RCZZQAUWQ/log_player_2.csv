"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate affects me less. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair considering the difference in inflation rates. Let's see what I can propose next to try and get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation rates and tries to find a more balanced division.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation hits me harder, I think this split is more fair.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice responds to this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is catching up.  Let's settle this quickly with a slightly better offer for me. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Despite the increasing impact of inflation, Alice's offer doesn't seem to take into account the disproportionate effect it has on my share. I'll wait for the next round to try and negotiate a better deal, considering the money's decreasing value for both of us.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, I'll adjust my offer to try and find a compromise that considers the decreasing value of the money for both of us, but still aims to balance out the difference in inflation rates.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800, ""message"": ""Inflation is affecting both of us, but I'm taking a bigger hit. This split tries to find a middle ground considering the current devaluation.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice responds to this revised proposal."
