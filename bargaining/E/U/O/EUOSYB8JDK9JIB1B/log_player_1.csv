"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is in order. Let's work together to find a fair solution. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'll consider the effective values:

My gain: $6,000
Bob's gain: $4,900 (10% less than $5,500)

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems more favorable to me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
