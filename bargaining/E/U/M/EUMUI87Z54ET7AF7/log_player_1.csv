"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping this will be a fair and reasonable starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $6,000 gain in the first round is now worth $5,700 in the second round.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, but I think it's a reasonable compromise considering Bob's message. I'll accept the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
