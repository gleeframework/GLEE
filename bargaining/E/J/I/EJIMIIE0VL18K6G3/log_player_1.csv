"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, fair and square!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm making the offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll calculate the actual amount I'll gain:

$40 * 0.95 (1 - 0.05 inflation) = $38

I'll consider this offer. Since I'll gain $38, I'll accept Bob's offer.
