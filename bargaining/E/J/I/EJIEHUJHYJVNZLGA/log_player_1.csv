"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 30 is worth 90% of the original 60, so it's effectively 54.

I'm not too happy with the offer, but I'll consider it. Since Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, my effective gain is now 90% of 54, which is 48.60.

I'll try to get a better deal this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. 50-50 sounds fair to me.""
}
```"
