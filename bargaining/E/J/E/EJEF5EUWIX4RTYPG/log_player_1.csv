"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a 70/30 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution while accounting for the inflation difference.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a more balanced proposal, considering the inflation factor is still relatively low at this stage. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
