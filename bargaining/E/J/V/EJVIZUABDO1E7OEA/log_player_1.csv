"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair compromise!""}

I'm proposing that I get 700,000 and Bob gets 300,000. I think this is a reasonable split, considering we're starting with a large amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'm being generous! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's too one-sided. I'd like to get a better deal, considering the initial amount was $1,000,000. I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 6:4 is a fair compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 6:4 split, which is a more balanced offer than my initial proposal. I'm willing to compromise and give up some of my initial demand to get a better deal."
