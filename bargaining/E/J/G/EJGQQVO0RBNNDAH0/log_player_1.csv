"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite aggressive!

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not accepting an offer that leaves me with just $5. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more reasonable offer this time. Considering the inflation, my offer is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems more balanced considering the reduced value of the money."
