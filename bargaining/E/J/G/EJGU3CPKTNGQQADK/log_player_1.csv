"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take 90$ and give Bob 10$. It's a pretty fair deal, and it leaves room for negotiation in the future rounds if we both agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, accepting this offer is the most logical choice.  Even with the inflation, I'm getting a decent amount, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better deal in the next round."
