"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a high offer, I'll meet you in the middle this time. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is equivalent to $285,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is equivalent to $630,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it's still a relatively large difference in favor of Bob. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is equivalent to $540,000. I'll aim to meet Bob halfway between the original proposal and his counteroffer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you in the middle, let's see if we can find common ground.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $450,000 is worth 54.74% of what it was in the first round, which is equivalent to $544,700. Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 55% of what it was in the first round, which is equivalent to $550,000.

This offer is very close to the original 50-50 split, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving up the extra $100,000 I had proposed earlier. However, I don't want to risk going back to the drawing board and potentially losing more value due to further inflation.
