I propose to take 900,000$ and leave 100,000$ for Bob. This seems like a fair offer considering the large amount of money at stake, and the fact that I am making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm increasing my offer to Bob by 100,000$, hoping he'll accept. This is the last round before inflation makes the money worth significantly less, so it's in our best interest to agree."
