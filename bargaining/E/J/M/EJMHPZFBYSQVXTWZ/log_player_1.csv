"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving away too much yet! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I gain is $450,000 (500,000 x 0.9).

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $300,000, which is worth 60% of the original $500,000. This is a relatively small share, but it's still better than nothing.

I'll accept this offer.
