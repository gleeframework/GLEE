"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50, you take 50. Simple and fair. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll get 50 * 0.95 = 47.5.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll do better than that!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either! I'll take 55, you take 45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, it seems Bob is trying to get me to accept the same offer as before, but I'll do some math to calculate the actual value of the money.

In the first round, I would have gotten $60, but due to inflation, the money is worth 14.26% less. So, the equivalent value of $45 in the fourth round is:

$45 / (1 - 0.1426) = $52.21

I'm not going to fall for the same offer twice! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not buying what you're selling, Bob!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 53,
  ""bob_gain"": 47,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not going to give in just yet!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $53 and Bob gets $47. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
