"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a division of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob.  This is a fair starting point, considering I have the advantage of proposing first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm also adjusting my proposal considering Bob's counter-offer.  I believe this division is fair, given the inflation and the fact that I'll be making the proposal in the next round if this is rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is less than ideal, the inflation is significantly hurting my potential earnings with each passing round. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least some money, and I risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting."
