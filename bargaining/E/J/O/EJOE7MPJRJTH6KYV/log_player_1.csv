Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking the majority share but still giving him a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer. While I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm increasing my offer from the previous round, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. This is still a substantial amount for him, and I'm confident that I can still secure a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While it's significantly less than I initially hoped for, considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing at all, this is a decent deal."
