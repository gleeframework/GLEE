"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can both go home rich!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. The message is a gentle reminder that this is a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split, considering the money will be worth less with each passing round. Let's end this game now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd rather not wait and take what I can get. I'll accept Bob's offer.
