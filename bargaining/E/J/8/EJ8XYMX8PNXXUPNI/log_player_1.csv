"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to compromise and give you $4,000.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is still worth $6,000, but Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth $3,200 (80% of $4,000).

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split in my favor, with me getting $4,200 and Bob getting $5,800. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and go for a bigger share, but I'll still give you a small portion. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is getting worse! My gain of $6,000 in the first round is still worth $6,000, but Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth $2,112 (51.2% of $4,000).

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer. $2,000 is still a decent amount, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round."
