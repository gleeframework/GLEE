"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself, with the message ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide."""
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a 50/50 split, which seems reasonable given the circumstances."
