"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for my liking, Alice. Let's be fair and split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate for more, accepting a 50/50 split now is a safe and logical choice.  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth."
