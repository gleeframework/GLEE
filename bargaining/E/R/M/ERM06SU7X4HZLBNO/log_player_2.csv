"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical, Bob. Take this generous offer and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a high-stakes negotiation game, and taking such a small portion initially could be a bad strategy. It's better to see if Alice is willing to offer more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a fair split, Alice.  Let's avoid the risk of inflation and get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's end this now before inflation hurts us both further. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's still not a huge portion, accepting this offer secures a guaranteed gain for Bob. The risk of inflation is high, and it's unlikely Alice will offer more in the future. It's better to take what's offered and minimize the potential for losing everything."
