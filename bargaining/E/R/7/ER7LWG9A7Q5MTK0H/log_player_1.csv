"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000. It's a good starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my potential gain of $400,000 in this round is equivalent to $320,000 in the first round. It's a significant decrease.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. After considering the numbers, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation affecting my potential gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering you $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000. It's a stronger offer, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
