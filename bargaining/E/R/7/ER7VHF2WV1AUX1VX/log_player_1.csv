"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering the initial amount is $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can have 60% and I'll take 40%. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $6000 I would gain in this round is actually worth less than the $8000 I would have gained in the first round. I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my potential gain is worth 40% of what it was in the first round, due to inflation. Considering this, I'll make a more aggressive offer.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 50% and we can call it a day. It's a fair split considering the inflation""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal. You can have 70% and I'll take 30%. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of my gain by 48.8%, the $7000 I would gain in this round is actually worth less than the $8000 I would have gained in the first round. However, this is a slightly better offer than the previous one, and I'm not sure if I should hold out for more. I'll accept this offer.
