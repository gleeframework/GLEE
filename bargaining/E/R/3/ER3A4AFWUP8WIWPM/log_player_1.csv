Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! I think this split is more reflective of the decreasing value of the money over time.  Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer of $30 for myself and $70 for him. Given the inflation rates, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
