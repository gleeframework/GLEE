"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take 60% of the money, and Bob can have 40%. This is a reasonable offer, considering that the money is worth more to me than it is to Bob in subsequent rounds. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch roles, I'll take 60% this time.  Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth less to both of us now, and considering that I offered Bob 40% in the previous round, I'll reject this offer. The 5% decrease in value for me is less significant than the 10% decrease for Bob, so I still have some leverage. Let's see if I can get a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I've rejected his offer and it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll be a bit more generous, but not too much. Take it or leave it!""}\n\n###\n\nI've decreased my share by 2% to account for the inflation, but I'm still trying to maintain a strong position. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
