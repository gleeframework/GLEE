"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain in the second round as 50 * 0.9 = 45.

With this in mind, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the second round, I'll calculate my gain in the third round as 45 * 0.9 = 40.5.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","To calculate my gain in the fourth round, I'll first determine the value of the money in the third round, which is 40.5. Then, I'll apply the 27.1% inflation to find my gain in the fourth round: 40.5 * 0.727 = 29.41.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the third round, I'll calculate my gain in the fifth round as 40.5 * 0.727 = 29.41. 

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70
}
```"
