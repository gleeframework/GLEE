Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a very fair 45% before inflation further erodes your share.  Don't be greedy. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
