"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's split it 60-40. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob will get 40%, or $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being generous, but I'm not ready to settle yet! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still get $250,000, but for Bob, the money is worth 5% less, so he's offering $750,000.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much more money. I'll reject his offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55-45. Don't wait too long!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous split, but still trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm not backing down! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation. The money is worth 0% less for me, but for Bob, it's worth 14.26% less than in the first round. He's offering $650,000, which is a significant amount.

However, I'm not willing to give up that much more money. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, I'm taking control! You can either accept or regret it.""
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, which is a significant shift in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept or try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's call it a draw, but I'm still not giving up on a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get a more even split, but I'm not sure if it's a good idea to accept a 50-50 split now. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'd still get $500,000, but for Bob, it's worth 22.62% less than in the first round.

However, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer later, and the game is running out of rounds. I'll consider this a decent offer, but I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, given that the game is running out of rounds. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! Take it or leave it. I'm not getting any softer.""
}
```

I'm offering a 75-25 split, which is a significant advantage for me. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared for him to reject it and try to make a last-ditch effort to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to squeeze me out, but I'm not going down without a fight! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get back to a more even split, but the money is worth 30.17% less for him than in the first round. He's offering $400,000, which is still a significant amount, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

Considering the game is running out of rounds, I'll accept this offer. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than going home with nothing.
