"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm going for a classic 90/10 split in my favor. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively unfair deal, or if he's looking for a more even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm losing money due to inflation, accepting this offer would mean getting only 10 dollars, which is even less than Bob offered me initially.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. While the value of my share is lower due to inflation, I'm still trying to get a decent amount. This offer shows that I'm willing to compromise, but I also want to maintain some leverage."
