"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly and avoid the potential negative effects of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is a significant shift in the division, and I am not willing to accept it. I believe we can still find a more equitable split, especially given the potential for further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower amount to Bob than my initial offer, but still a considerable portion of the money. I'm trying to find a balance between ensuring a fair share for myself and potentially avoiding further rounds of negotiation and inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is even more lopsided than the previous round.  I will continue to negotiate for a fairer split, as the potential for inflation makes accepting such an unequal offer unwise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm reducing my share again, but still offering a substantial portion to Bob. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to compromise and find a solution before we risk losing significant value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is slightly better than the previous round, it's still heavily skewed in Bob's favor. I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal, especially with the looming threat of further inflation.  I believe we can still find a more balanced solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm lowering my share once more, but still maintaining a majority. The risk of inflation is growing, so finding a compromise is becoming more important. Hopefully, this offer will be enough to convince Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer continues to be unbalanced, and the threat of inflation is escalating. I'm not willing to accept a deal that favors him so heavily, especially when there are only a few rounds left. I will continue to negotiate for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50} 
```

With only a few rounds left, I'm proposing an even split. This is a fair and reasonable solution that accounts for the growing risk of inflation. I hope Bob will finally accept this offer."
