"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. This is a 60-40 split, which is a reasonable starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think I can do better than this. Let's see what you have to say. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential earnings.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to meet in the middle just yet. I'm hoping to do better than 50-50.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is still eating away at my potential earnings. In round 3, my proposal is worth 40% less than in round 1.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $45 and Bob gets $55. I'm trying to stay ahead of the inflation curve and still get a decent share of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings now.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with giving up that much more. I think I can do better than this.""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'm not sure how much more I can give up, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I need to get something in return. This is my last offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $30 and Bob gets $70. I'm trying to be realistic about the value of money at this point, but I'm still hoping to get a decent share. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower."
