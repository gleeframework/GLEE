"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your cut decreases faster with inflation, Alice. Let's be practical. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is still generous considering the inflation. Let's settle this now."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

1. **Time Pressure:**  Every round, the value of the money decreases for me due to inflation. It's in my best interest to settle this quickly.

2. **Slight Concession:** Bob offered me 480,000 in Round 2. I'm countering by slightly increasing my share from the previous round while still offering him more than his last proposal. 

3. **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I don't want to concede too much, as it might make Bob think I'm desperate. Offering a slightly better deal than his last keeps me in a strong bargaining position."
