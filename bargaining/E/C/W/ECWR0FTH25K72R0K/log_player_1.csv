"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Accept this fair offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'm taking the remaining 60%, which is $60. I'm framing it as a fair offer to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but still a good chunk for me too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $70 in this round is equivalent to $56 in the first round (a 20% decrease). Bob's gain of $30 is equivalent to $36 in the first round (a 5% decrease).

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's still a decent compromise. I'll decide to reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share this time, but I'm still willing to give him a chance to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not getting desperate yet! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of $75 in this round is equivalent to $39.23 in the first round (a 48.8% decrease). Bob's gain of $25 is equivalent to $36.35 in the first round (a 14.26% decrease).

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's still a decent compromise. I'll decide to reject it for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Last chance! Take it or walk away!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small share this time, but I'm willing to give him a chance to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting desperate yet, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time... 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent values in the first round:

My gain of $85 in this round is equivalent to $12.75 in the first round (a 67.23% decrease). Bob's gain of $15 is equivalent to $18.45 in the first round (a 22.62% decrease).

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's getting close to the point where I might as well accept to get some money rather than risking losing even more value due to inflation. I'll decide to accept it.
