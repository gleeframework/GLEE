"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share. It's a risky move, but I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is taking a huge risk here. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better than his previous one, but I'm still going to reject it. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round.  The inflation rate is higher for me, and while he might be willing to accept a small gain, I can still leverage his desire to win."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to keep raising my offer, but slowly. This time, I'm offering Bob 30% of the money, which is significantly more than he was getting before.  While inflation is impacting me more, the time is running out and I believe Bob will be more likely to accept."

```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. The inflation rate is hurting me significantly, but I think I can still get a better deal.  The time is running out, but Bob is not showing any signs of accepting a low offer. I believe I can push him further."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but this time, I'm offering Bob 40% of the money. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation rate, but I believe I can still convince Bob to accept this offer before we run out of time.  The stakes are getting higher, and we're approaching the halfway point of the game."

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. The inflation rate is really hurting me now, but I think I can still get a better deal.  I'm taking a risk, but I believe Bob will be more willing to accept a higher offer than he has been. We're entering the final rounds, and the pressure is on."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

The inflation rate is really hurting me now, and I'm running out of time. I'm going to offer Bob an even split of the money.  It's the most I can afford to give him, and it might be the only way I can get him to accept before we both get nothing.  The pressure is mounting with each passing round."
