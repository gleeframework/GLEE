I'm going to start by offering a seemingly generous split, hoping to secure a quick agreement and minimize the risk of inflation.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very unfair, especially considering the inflation. While I'd like to get something, I'm not willing to accept such a drastically unequal split.  Let's see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to 60% of the money, while still leaving a significant portion for Bob. This reflects the reduced value of the money and the fact that we're only in the third round.  Let's see if this offer is more appealing."
