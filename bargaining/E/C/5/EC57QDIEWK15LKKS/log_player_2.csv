"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40. It's fair, considering the potential inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's tempting to take the 40, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  There's a lot of money on the table, and inflation might make Alice's offer less appealing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's reverse the roles, I propose 60/40 for me, but you'll get the chance to propose next round, so maybe you can get a better deal then.""}
