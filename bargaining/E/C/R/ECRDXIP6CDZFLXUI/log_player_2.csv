Let's see how the game unfolds. While not the best offer, I want to see how desperate Alice gets as the rounds progress and inflation eats into her share."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to concede some ground, but I won't be taken advantage of. This is a fair split.

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is getting desperate, but I think I can push my luck a little further. The inflation is hitting her side much harder than mine. Let's see what she offers next round."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I won't be bullied. This is the last chance for a fair deal before we both lose more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a good enough offer to take at this stage.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and while I could push for more, there's a real risk she might dig in her heels and offer me even less in the next round.  It's better to take a decent offer now than risk getting a worse one later, or even worse, walking away with nothing."
