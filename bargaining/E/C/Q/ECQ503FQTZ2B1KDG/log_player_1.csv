"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair split, considering we're starting from scratch!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and leaving Bob with 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we're both starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more equitable split this time.  We both get a decent share, and we can avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Considering the inflation effect, I'm not thrilled about the decreasing value of my potential gain. However, Bob's proposal does seem more equitable this time around.

I'll accept the offer:
