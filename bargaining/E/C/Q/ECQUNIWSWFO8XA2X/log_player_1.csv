"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $300,000 is worth $285,000 (95% of $300,000), and Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth $630,000 (90% of $700,000).

I'm not thrilled about the 70-30 split, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the 70-30 split. I'll think about it, but I'm not ready to accept yet.""
}
```

It's my turn to make a new offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 90% of 95% of the previous round's gain, so my gain is now worth 85.5% of the original $300,000, which is $257,500.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. How about a 55-45 split? It's a bit more in your favor, but I think it's a fair offer.""
}
```

Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway with a 50-50 split. It's not perfect, but it's a fair compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $550,000 is now worth $473,250 (85.5% of $550,000).

Bob's gain of $450,000 is now worth $326,500 (27.1% less than $450,000).

I'm not thrilled about the inflation, but I think a 50-50 split is a fair compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I accept the 50-50 split. It's not ideal, but it's a fair compromise given the circumstances.""
}
```

I think it's time to wrap up the game!"
