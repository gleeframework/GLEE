"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you 400k and keep 600k for myself. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 400k is a decent starting point, it's worth holding out to see if Alice is willing to offer more.  With the inflation factor, waiting a few rounds could make a big difference."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
