"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal aims to divide the funds in a manner that reflects the decreasing value of money over time. As inflation affects us differently, I propose we split the initial amount of $100 with a ratio that compensates for the differing rates of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
