"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, aiming to secure a large portion of the money. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a small amount in the first round, hoping for a better deal in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I proposed in the first round, and the inflation penalty is starting to bite. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm lowering my initial demand to try and reach a compromise. Bob seems to be aiming for a larger share, so I'm offering him a more significant portion while still keeping a substantial amount for myself. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and the inflation penalty is really starting to hit. While this offer represents a larger share for me than in the previous round, I'm still going to reject it.  I'm hoping to leverage the inflation factor to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

At this point, the inflation is significantly impacting my potential earnings.  I'm going to offer a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will realize that continuing to reject offers will only hurt him as well."
