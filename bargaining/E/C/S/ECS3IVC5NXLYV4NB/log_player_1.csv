"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor.  This seems fair given the risk of inflation, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a better split, the risk of inflation is significant. Accepting this offer guarantees me a substantial amount, even with the reduced value. It's better than potentially getting nothing if we continue to reject offers and the money keeps decreasing in value."
