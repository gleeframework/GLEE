"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much for me.  Let's try 70/30. We both get a decent amount, and we can avoid further rounds of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000
