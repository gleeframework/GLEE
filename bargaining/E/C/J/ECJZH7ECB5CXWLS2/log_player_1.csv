"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

Let's see how Bob responds to this offer!  Since I am playing as Alice, I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a bit of a gamble, but hopefully, Bob sees the value in getting something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it's frustrating that Bob rejected my initial offer, I'm happy to accept a 50/50 split. It's better than getting nothing at all, especially since the money is losing value with each round."
