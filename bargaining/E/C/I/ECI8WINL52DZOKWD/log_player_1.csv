"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

This means I'm offering to take 700,000 dollars and give Bob 300,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 580,000 for me and 420,000 for him, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

This is a slightly better deal for me, but I'm still willing to compromise."
