"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice. Let's split it down the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain would be worth even less in the next round, so I'd better think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it down the middle just yet. I'd like to see if I can do better."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 20% toll, the money is worth even less now. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Consider this a fair offer, Bob.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can move on."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a bigger toll now. With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think I can do better. I'll keep pushing for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting close to your number, Bob. But I'm not quite there yet. Meet me in the middle again?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping this will be the one that sticks."

Round 6

# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, Alice. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now. With the money worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I need to think carefully about this final offer.

After considering it, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's final offer. I don't want to risk waiting for another round and seeing the value of the money drop even further. This seems like a decent compromise."
