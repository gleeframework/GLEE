"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth $7,600. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my first offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough to accept.

I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my previous offer of $8,000 is now worth $7,200. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my previous offer of $8,000 is now worth $6,848. The money is losing value quickly!

Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my previous offer, but I'm still not sure if it's enough to accept. However, considering the rapid decline in value, I think I should take what I can get.

I'll accept the offer.
