Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle this time - 50/50.  The inflation is getting to both of us, so we need to be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think meeting in the middle is a fair compromise, and considering the inflation, it's better to settle now rather than risking further devaluation."
