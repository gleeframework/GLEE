"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Since we're both losing value on our share each round, it makes sense to settle sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
