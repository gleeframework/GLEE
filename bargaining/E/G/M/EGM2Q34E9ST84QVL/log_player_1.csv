"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values, I'll consider the offer.

My current proposal was rejected, and now Bob is offering me $450,000, which is worth 5% less than my initial proposal. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering it's still a relatively small amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll make a new proposal. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

This way, I'm aiming for a slightly better share, considering the reduced value of the money."
