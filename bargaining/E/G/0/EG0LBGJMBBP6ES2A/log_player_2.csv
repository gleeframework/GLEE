Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to be realistic here.  We're both losing value with each round.  This offer is a good compromise, and it's the best we can do at this point.

# Alice gain: 6500

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, Alice is feeling the brunt of the inflation far more than Bob.  She's becoming increasingly desperate. Bob can afford to hold out for a slightly better offer in the next round or two."
