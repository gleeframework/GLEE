"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my proposed gain of $600,000 in round 1 would be worth only $570,000 in round 2, and Bob's proposed gain of $400,000 would be worth $400,000.

Bob's new offer is a 50-50 split, which is a more equitable one. I accept this offer.
