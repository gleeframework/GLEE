"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take 99.9% and leave you with 0.1%, Bob. Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While 1,000 dollars is a significant amount of money, it's a pittance compared to what Alice is taking. I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal. Let's see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering I'm willing to let you have a significant portion despite the fact that you opened with an insultingly low offer."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. This is a fair offer, considering the previous round. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is slowly moving in the right direction, but we're not there yet. Accepting a 45/55 split now would set a bad precedent for the rest of the negotiation. I believe I can get her closer to an even split with a little more pressure.  We still have time before inflation significantly eats into the potential gains."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle.  52/48 is my final offer. It's more than fair considering you're getting nearly half a million dollars after trying to lowball me initially.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  50/50 is the fairest way to split this.  We've both been stubborn, and the money is losing value with each round.  Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is it! Alice is finally willing to agree to an even split. It's not worth risking further inflation to try and squeeze out a slightly larger share. A 50/50 split ensures we both walk away with a substantial sum!"
