Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try to meet in the middle, 57-43 is a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, it's still beneficial for me to hold out a little longer. The impact of inflation is becoming more significant, and I want to aim for a slightly better deal."
