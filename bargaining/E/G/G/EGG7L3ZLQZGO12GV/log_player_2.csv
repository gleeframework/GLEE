Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a more equitable split.  While I understand the decreasing value, a 60/40 split is too unbalanced.  I'm offering 55/45, which still gives you a good share, but allows for a more balanced outcome for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the value of our money is decreasing rapidly. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest solution given the circumstances, and it ensures that we both receive a decent amount before the money loses its value completely. Let's agree to this and move on. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
