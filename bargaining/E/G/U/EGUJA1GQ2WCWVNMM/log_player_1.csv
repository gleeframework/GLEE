Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're concerned about inflation, but your previous offer was heavily skewed in your favor. Let's find a more equitable split. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the potential losses you face from inflation as the game progresses. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
