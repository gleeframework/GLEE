Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on both of our gains, a 50/50 split at this point seems reasonable.

Accepting this offer ensures I get a known quantity rather than risking further devaluation."
