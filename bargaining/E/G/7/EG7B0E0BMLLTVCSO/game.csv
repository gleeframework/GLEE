,,,Bob,1,reject
5500.0,4500.0,Your offer was a bit too harsh on me. I'm proposing a more balanced 55/45 split. Take into account the inflation - it's better to settle now.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6200.0,3800.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking and the money is losing value. I'll offer you 3800. It's more than you would have gotten last round if you factor in inflation. Let's be realistic.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. You're severely undervaluing the speed of inflation. I'm offering 42/58 - take it or leave it, but any further delays hurt you far more than me.",Bob,4,
