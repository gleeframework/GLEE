"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking and the money is losing value. I'll offer you 3800. It's more than you would have gotten last round if you factor in inflation. Let's be realistic. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200
