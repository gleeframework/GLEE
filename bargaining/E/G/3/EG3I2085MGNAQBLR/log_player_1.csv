"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, seems fair to me""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I think this is a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going for 4:1! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, my $8,000 from Round 1 is now worth $7,200.

Considering Bob's offer in Round 2, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 2:3 split. I'll wait for his next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again due to inflation, my $7,200 from Round 1 is now worth $6,480.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 5.5:4.5""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, trying to find a middle ground."
