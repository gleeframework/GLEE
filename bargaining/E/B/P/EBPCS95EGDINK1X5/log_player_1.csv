"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial amount, which is a fair share, and leaves Bob with 10%. The message is a bit playful to try to get him to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of 90% of the original amount, which is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 or 81% of the original amount.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is taking the inflation into account, but I'll assume he's not aware of it. In that case, his offer is still a 50-50 split, which is a good deal for me considering the inflation.

I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
