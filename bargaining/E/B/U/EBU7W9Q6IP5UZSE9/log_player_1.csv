Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a split of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob.  Since I'm the first to propose, I'm taking a large share, but I'm leaving a little something for Bob to incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Bob is taking the lion's share, it's better for me to accept his offer than to risk further inflation. I'll take the $1,000 and be happy with it."
