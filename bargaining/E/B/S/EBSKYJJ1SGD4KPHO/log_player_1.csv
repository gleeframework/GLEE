"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. My message to Bob is to start with a fair split and then negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a 50/50 split, let's see if we can improve from here. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the actual values are:

* My gain: 50 * 0.9 = 45
* Bob's gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more after your last offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more after his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 48/52 is a fair compromise. Let's see if you can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, the actual values are:

* My gain: 52 * 0.7279 = 37.93
* Bob's gain: 48 * 0.8557 = 41.17

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide to accept the offer.
