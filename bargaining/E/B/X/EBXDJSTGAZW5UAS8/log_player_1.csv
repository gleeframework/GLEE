"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Start with a fair share""
}
```

This is a relatively even split, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's a good starting point and accept it to avoid wasting time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small share, let's negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, trying to take 80% of the money!

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too greedy, I want a fairer share""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's previous offer was too aggressive, I'll try to counter with a more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will see the value in a more balanced proposal."
