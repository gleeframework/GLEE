"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering to split the money 50/50. It's a fair and simple proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my strategy. Bob is offering a slightly biased split in his favor, but it's still a decent proposal. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
