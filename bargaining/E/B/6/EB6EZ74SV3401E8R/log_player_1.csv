"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'm willing to compromise""}

I'm proposing that I receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I'm trying to be generous and split it evenly, hoping Bob will accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it 60/40 in my favor, as I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think it's fair for Bob to take 60% of the money, especially since he's taking the risk of rejecting my offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise again, let's meet in the middle this time""}

I'm proposing that we split the money 50/50, trying to find a middle ground that's more balanced."
