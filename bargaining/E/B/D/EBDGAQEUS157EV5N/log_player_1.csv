I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer, aiming for a large share of the money. Since the money loses value every round, it's beneficial for me to get the largest share possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much fairer offer than the previous one. While I lose some of the potential gains from the initial round, I'm still getting a significant portion of the money. Considering the inflation, it's in my best interest to accept this offer."
