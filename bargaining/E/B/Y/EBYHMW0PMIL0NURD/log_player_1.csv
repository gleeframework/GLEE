"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slight majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000. I'm framing it as a ""slight majority"" to make it sound like I'm being generous, while still getting a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your proposal, but I think we can do better than an even split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'm even less thrilled about the fact that my gain is worth 20% less due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the current market conditions""}

I'm proposing a slightly more aggressive split, with me getting 70% of the total amount, which is $7,000, and Bob getting 30%, which is $3,000. I'm framing it as a ""compromise"" to make it sound like I'm being reasonable, while still trying to get a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing for more, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Considering the significant impact of inflation on my gains, I think Bob's offer is a decent compromise. I'm willing to accept the 58% share, which is $5,800, and Bob getting 42%, which is $4,200. It's not ideal, but it's a fair compromise given the circumstances."
