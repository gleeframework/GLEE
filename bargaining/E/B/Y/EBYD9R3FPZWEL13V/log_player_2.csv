Alice's offer:

While a 60-40 split seems reasonable, it's in my best interest to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll reject and see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's flip the script!  A 60-40 split in my favor seems fair to me.  Accept this offer, and we can both walk away with a good chunk of money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I still believe I could potentially get a better deal, I'm willing to accept this offer. Alice is now losing value on her share of the money with each passing round, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer in the future. This is a decent split, and it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing."
