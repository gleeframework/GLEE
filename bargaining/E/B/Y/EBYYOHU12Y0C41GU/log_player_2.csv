Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to come down a bit more.  55/45 seems like a good compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly budging, but it's still heavily in her favor.  The inflation is working against me, but I need to hold out for a better deal a little longer. Accepting 45% now is a significant loss, even with the shrinking pot from Bob's perspective."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. I'm proposing 60/40. This is a fair split considering the time pressure and inflation working against me.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

- **Strategic Concession:** Bob is making a significant concession by dropping his demand to 60%. This shows Alice he's willing to negotiate but remains firm on getting a reasonable share.
- **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds left, the message emphasizes the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain. This urgency could push Alice towards a quicker agreement.
- **Fairness Emphasis:** By repeatedly stating that his offers are fair, Bob subtly puts pressure on Alice to justify her more one-sided proposals."
