Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is still generous considering the inflation. We need to reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. We both lose significantly with every passing round. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Although not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us, but especially for me. Waiting longer means a smaller share will be worth even less.
* **Finality:** Alice stated this is her final offer.  Continuing the game risks her digging in further, leading to a worse outcome or even no agreement at all.
* **Better Than Nothing:** While not my ideal split, 450,000 is still a significant sum of money. Refusing and getting nothing at the end would be a huge loss."
