Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer. Since Bob's money is worth less each round, I'm betting he'll accept this even though it's heavily in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer to have more, the money will only continue to lose value for Bob. He's already lost 5% of his potential gains, and there's no guarantee he'll offer anything more in the future. Accepting this 50/50 split is the safest option to ensure I get a significant share of the money."
