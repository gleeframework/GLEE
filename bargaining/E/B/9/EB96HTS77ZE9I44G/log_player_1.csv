"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start with a proposal that favors me a bit, but still gives Bob a small share.  Let's see if he's happy with this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Inflation is a factor, and I don't know what the future holds.  It's better to take a decent share now than risk getting nothing in the end."
