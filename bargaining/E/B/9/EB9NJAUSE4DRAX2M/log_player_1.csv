"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is still a 60% share, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to get a slightly better deal. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my revised proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gains. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to be very careful. However, I still need to get a decent share. Considering the reduced value of money, I'll accept this offer.
