"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. I take $60, you take $40. It's a good deal for both of us, especially considering the inflation!

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit unfair. Let's be reasonable, I'll take $55 and you can have $45.  This accounts for the inflation hitting you harder than me.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. I'll take $55, you take $45.  This is the same split you offered me last round, but the inflation means it's actually better for you now and worse for me. It's time to be fair and settle this. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
