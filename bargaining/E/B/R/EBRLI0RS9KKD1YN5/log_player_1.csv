"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, reflecting the value I bring to this partnership. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think you're considering the inflation factor, I'd like to propose a different split that takes that into account.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more for my efforts.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I still believe a 55/45 split is more equitable given the inflation. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to stick to his original idea!

I'll reject his offer again and try to push for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think you're not considering the accelerating inflation, I'd like to propose a more aggressive split to account for the decreasing value of the money.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Considering the rapid inflation, I think a 50/50 split is the most fair way to divide the remaining value of the money.""
}
```"
