"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90/10, a fair and generous offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A more balanced offer, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is losing its value, and I need to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me a relatively small share, even if it's a more balanced one. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Take a smaller share, but still a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give myself a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and Bob's offer is taking that into account. I need to think carefully about this new offer.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me a relatively small share, even if it's a larger share than my previous offers. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance for a reasonable deal, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer, but still leaving room for Bob to accept and end the game. If he rejects this offer, I'm not sure what he's thinking..."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's now or never, let's split it 50/50! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting desperate!

Considering the effects of inflation, I think a 50/50 split is a fair deal. I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's time to call it a day!"
