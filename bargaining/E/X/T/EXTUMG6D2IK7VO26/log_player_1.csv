"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself, which is a 70% share. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth 70% of 90% of the original amount, which is 63.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good one, considering the inflation. However, it's a fair and equal split, which might be a good compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my share would be worth 70% of 90% of the original amount, which is 63. So, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself, which is a 60% share, taking into account the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can still get a decent share! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth 70% of 72.9% of the original amount, which is approximately 51.03.

I'm not thrilled about the 40% share, but I'm not sure if I can do better. Considering the inflation, I think this might be a good opportunity to get a decent share.
