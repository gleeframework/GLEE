Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's settle, inflation will only hurt you more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly before the money is worthless.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take this before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him. 
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice seems unlikely to offer anything better. She's consistently offered proposals favoring herself, counting on Bob's desperation as inflation eats away at his potential share.

While getting $43 is less than ideal, it's better than risking even less in future rounds."
