"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split and see if we can do better in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous with the first round. I'm looking for a better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's make a deal before things get worse with inflation!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the 10% decrease in value for me, while also trying to give Bob a slightly better deal to make the proposal more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can smell it. I'm not budging, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting desperate, indeed!

Considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain in the first round was $5000, and now it's worth 72.9% of that value (100% - 27.1%). So, $5000 * 0.729 = $3645.

Bob's gain in the first round was $5000, and now it's worth 85.74% of that value (100% - 14.26%). So, $5000 * 0.8574 = $4291.

Considering these adjusted values, Bob's offer is:

* My gain: $4500 (which is more than $3645, so I'm getting a better deal than I would with the adjusted value)
* Bob's gain: $5500 (which is less than $4291, so Bob is getting a worse deal than he would with the adjusted value)

I'll accept this offer.
