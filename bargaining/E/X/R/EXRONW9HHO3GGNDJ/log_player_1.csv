"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, the $300,000 I would gain is actually equivalent to $240,000 in the first round. And Bob's $700,000 is equivalent to $630,000 in the first round.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll make a counteroffer. Let's try 55-45!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 220000,
  ""bob_gain"": 780000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I still want a fair share!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55.2-44.8 split, with me getting $220,000 and Bob getting $780,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm not giving up control 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! In this round, the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the $150,000 I would gain is actually equivalent to $150,000 / 0.5208 = $288,461 in the first round. And Bob's $850,000 is equivalent to $850,000 / 0.7231 = $1,173,333 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about the terms of this offer, but I'm not sure if I want to reject it and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. I'll think about it for a moment...
