"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a generous share, and I'll take the remaining $800,000. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's end it here. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I'm not as keen on giving up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share for myself and giving Bob a decent chunk as well."
