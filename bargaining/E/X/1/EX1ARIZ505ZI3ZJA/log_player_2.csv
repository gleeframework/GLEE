Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, time is the real enemy here.  The longer we wait, the less the money is worth.  I need to signal I'm willing to compromise, but not give in entirely.  There's a risk Alice will hold out for a larger share, but I'm hoping she sees the value in a quicker resolution."
