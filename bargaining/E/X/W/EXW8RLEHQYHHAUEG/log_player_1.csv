  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split is a fair proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 620000,
  ""bob_gain"": 380000,
  ""message"": ""This is my last offer, take it or walk away""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 520,000 and hope that it's enough to make it worth my while."
