"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can take 20%.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. Take 60% and I'll take 40% 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, Bob! My offer was a bit too generous, I suppose.

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $6,000 and Bob can take the $4,000. I'm hoping this is a good deal for both of us!"
