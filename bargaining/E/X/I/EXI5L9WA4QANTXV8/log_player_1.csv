"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $4000 in this round is actually worth $4000 * 0.9 = $3600 in real terms.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, especially since I was hoping for a higher share. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Since the money is worth 10% less again due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4500, but I think it's getting too close to 50/50 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, my gain of $4500 in this round is actually worth $4500 * 0.7231 = $3253.95 in real terms.

I'm still not happy with this offer, but it's getting closer to the 50/50 split I initially proposed. I'll reject it again and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make another offer, taking into account the continued inflation. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than the original amount, and 10% less than the previous round, my gain will be worth 37.1% less than the original amount.

Let's calculate my gain in real terms: $10,000 * 0.7231 * 0.9 = $6202.70

I'll propose a slightly higher share for myself this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to my target, but still willing to compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 3500, but I think I'm getting a bit shortchanged 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 40.95% less due to inflation, my gain of $3500 in this round is actually worth $3500 * 0.5915 = $2073.25 in real terms.

I'm getting desperate, and this offer is actually slightly better than my previous one in real terms. I'll accept it, hoping that Bob will finally agree to end the game.
