"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it?""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the original $10,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You didn't make a good first offer, but this one is fair too. Take it or leave it? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. 

In this round, the total amount is $10,000, but my gain is 4000, which is 40% of the original amount. This is less than the 80% I initially proposed, but more than the 40% I would get if I were to accept this offer.

However, considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is actually worth 80% of the original $4000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is a better deal than my initial offer.

So, I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
