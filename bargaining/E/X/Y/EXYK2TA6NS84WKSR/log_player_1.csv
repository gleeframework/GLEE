"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount. 

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 600,000 / 0.95 = 631,579.47 in terms of the original amount. 

I'll accept the offer.
