"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the diminishing value of the money over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Your offer was a good starting point, Alice. How about we meet a little closer to the middle?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your counter-offer, Bob, but the decreasing value over time means I need a bit more to make it worthwhile. This offer is still generous considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This offer is getting worse for me with each round. I need to push for a more favorable split soon or risk getting a much worse deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4700, ""alice_gain"": 5300, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. This offer is a serious attempt to reach a fair agreement considering the time pressure.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the value is decreasing rapidly. I'm sticking to a number that reflects the situation. Let's be realistic and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough spot.  Alice is clearly playing hardball and taking advantage of my higher inflation rate. However, if I reject this, the deal will only get worse for me in the coming rounds, and we risk walking away with nothing.  It's better to accept a less-than-ideal offer now than get stuck with a much worse one or nothing at all later."
