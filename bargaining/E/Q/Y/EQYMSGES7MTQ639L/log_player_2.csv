"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, Bob, but I'm not budging much. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
I'm holding out for a better offer. While the penalty for inflation is increasing, it's still early in the game and Alice will likely become more willing to negotiate as we get closer to the 12th round.
