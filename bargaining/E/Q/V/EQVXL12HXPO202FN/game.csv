5000.0,5000.0,Let's split the money equally. It's fair and simple.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"I'll take the majority, you get a small share, but it's still more than you'll get if we wait.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"I propose a 4500/5500 split. It's a bit less than the initial equal split, but still a fair deal considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'll take a bit more, but you'll still get a decent share, and we can avoid further inflation losses.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Considering the inflation, I suggest a 4200/5800 split. This keeps the difference between our shares relatively small while still compensating for the loss in value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a smaller share than before to avoid further losses due to inflation.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
3500.0,6500.0,I propose a 3500/6500 split. This maintains a reasonable difference between our shares while accounting for the significant inflation since the beginning of the game.,Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2000.0,8000.0,"I'll take the lion's share, but you'll still get a small consolation prize, and we can wrap up the game before further inflation hits.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"I suggest a 3000/7000 split. This offers a balanced compromise between our shares, taking into account the substantial inflation we've experienced.",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
1000.0,9000.0,"I'll take the vast majority, but you'll get a tiny fraction of the original amount, and we can finally end this game.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"I propose a 2500/7500 split. This maintains a reasonable balance between our shares, despite the high inflation.",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
500.0,9500.0,"I'll take almost all the remaining money, and you'll get a tiny fraction. It's the best you'll get at this point.",Bob,12,
