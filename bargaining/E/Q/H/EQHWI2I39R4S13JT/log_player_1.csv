Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take $999,000 and leave Bob with $1,000.  This is a very lopsided offer, but I'm hoping Bob will realize it's better than getting nothing if we fail to agree in 12 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
