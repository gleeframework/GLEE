Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower offer, but still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the difference between what I'll gain and what Bob will gain is too large, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a slight improvement from Bob's previous offer, I still think I can do better. The difference between what I'll gain and what Bob will gain is too large, and I want to try to get a more equitable split."
