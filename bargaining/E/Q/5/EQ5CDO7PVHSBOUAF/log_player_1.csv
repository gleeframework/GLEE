"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can do better later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we can negotiate for a better deal later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual value of the offer is:

Alice gain: $70 x 0.95 = $66.50
Bob gain: $30

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
