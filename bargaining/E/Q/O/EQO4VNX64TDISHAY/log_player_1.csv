"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a decent share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so $4000 is equivalent to $5000 in the first round.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob taking the majority, but I'm not sure I want to risk going to the next round and having the money be worth even less.
