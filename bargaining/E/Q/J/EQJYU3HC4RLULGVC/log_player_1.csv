"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous amount considering the initial value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous last round, let's try to get a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to get a better deal this time.

I'll reject his offer since I can get a better deal next round due to inflation. The money is worth less for Bob, so I can propose a more favorable split for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again! With inflation, the money is worth even less for Bob, so I'll take a bigger share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting less, I'm getting more, that's the way it goes!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not falling for it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

However, I notice that Bob's offer is actually a worse deal for him than my previous offer, considering the effects of inflation. My share is worth the same as before, but Bob's share is worth significantly less due to inflation.

I'll accept his offer, as it's a better deal for me than my previous offer.
