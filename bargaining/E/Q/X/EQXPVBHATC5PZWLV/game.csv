60.0,40.0,"Let's split the money fairly, Bob. You get 40% and I get 60%. This seems like a good deal for you considering the money will be worth less if we wait.",Alice,1,

50.0,50.0,Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest deal and we can both get the most out of it before the money loses value.,Bob,2,

65.0,35.0,"Bob, I understand you want to split evenly, but the value decreases for me each round. I need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Let's do 65/35 and end this.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm not willing to accept a deal where I get significantly less than half.  Let's split it 55/45. This is a fairer deal that accounts for the decreasing value of the money for you while still giving me a reasonable share.",Bob,4,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, we're running out of time.  I'm sticking with my initial offer of 60/40. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.  Let's be sensible and end this here.",Alice,5,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, we're running low on time. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share than 40% to make this worthwhile. Let's split it 60/40, considering the significant value loss you're experiencing. It's the best we can do at this point.",Bob,6,
