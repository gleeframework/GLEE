"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leave 30 dollars for Bob. I think this is a reasonable split, but I'm open to negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair. Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 dollars is actually worth 32 dollars in terms of purchasing power (since 20% less than 50 dollars, which is 70% of 70 dollars).

I'm not too thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to accept it to end the game quickly. I'd rather get 32 dollars than risk waiting for another round and potentially getting less.
