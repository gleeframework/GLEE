Bob's offer is better than my previous one, but I'm still confident I can do better! Let's see if I can get a more favorable deal in the next round."

I'm going to slightly increase my share, but still offer Bob a decent amount. I think it's a fair offer considering the inflation and the fact that I'm the one making the offer this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer is a bit worse than my previous offer, but after the inflation, it's a good deal. I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better offer in the next round, so I'll accept it."
