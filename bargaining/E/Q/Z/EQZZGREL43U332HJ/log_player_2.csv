"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's too early to accept an offer. We have 12 rounds and Alice is taking a bigger share even after accounting for the inflation. Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split it more evenly, considering the inflation will affect you more heavily. This offer gives you a decent share while still leaving a good amount for me.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've considered your offer, but I think I can do a bit better. This way we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Alice is still taking a larger share, this offer is closer to an even split than before. Given the inflation, the value of her share is decreasing much faster than mine, making this a more favorable deal for me in the long run."
