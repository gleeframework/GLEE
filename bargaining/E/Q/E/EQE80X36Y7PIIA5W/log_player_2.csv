"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. 50/50 split! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, I'm taking a risk, but I think it's worth a try. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since I'm taking the risk with inflation!""}\n\nI'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, considering I'm taking a hit from inflation in each subsequent round. Fingers crossed!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it almost evenly, but I need to make up for the risk of inflation! I'm willing to go up to 52 if we can close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not ready to accept this offer yet. With inflation, I'll be losing even more value in the next round, but I think I can still try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens next!\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger risk with inflation now. Can we meet in the middle... of my side?""}\n\nI'm trying to push my luck a bit further, considering the impact of inflation on my potential gain. Hopefully, Alice will see the value in closing the deal now rather than risking further rounds. Fingers crossed!###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to concede a little more, but I'm still taking the risk of inflation. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm still not ready to accept this offer. With inflation taking a bigger bite out of my potential gain, I need to try and get a better deal. I'm taking a risk, but I think it's worth it. Let's see what happens next!\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, but I'm still hoping we can meet closer to my side. This is my best offer yet!""}\n\nI'm pushing my luck even further, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal now, given that we're already halfway through the rounds. Fingers crossed!###\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. Inflation is hurting both of us, but I'm willing to give you more than a 50/50 split. Let's finish this before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, I think it's wise to accept Alice's offer. With inflation taking a significant bite out of my potential gain, and considering we're more than halfway through the rounds, I don't think I can negotiate a better deal. Alice's offer is reasonable, and I'd rather take the 45 now than risk getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. Time to close the deal!###\n\n###"
