"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a third of the total amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer is 50/50 split, I'll have to think carefully about it.

I'll reject this offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect, my offer needs to be adjusted accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a larger share, but still trying to maximize my own gain. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth significantly less now. Bob's offer is still a 50/50 split, but considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll think about it carefully.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
