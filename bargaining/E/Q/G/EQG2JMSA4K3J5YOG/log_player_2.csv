Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer.  Let's try 52/48 in my favor.  We're running out of time, and I think we both want to get something out of this. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While time is ticking, Alice is clearly moving closer to a more even split.  My offers are influencing hers. If I hold out a bit longer, I might secure a slightly better deal before the inflation eats too much of my potential gain."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close! Let's settle this. I'll meet you halfway - 55 for me, 45 for you. Deal?""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming a significant factor now. Offering a 55/45 split shows willingness to compromise while still securing a slightly advantageous position. It's important to reach an agreement soon before inflation erodes the value of any potential deal."
