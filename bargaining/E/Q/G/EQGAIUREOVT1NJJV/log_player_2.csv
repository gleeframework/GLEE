"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm not happy with that deal! Let's see if we can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  A 50/50 split seems like a reasonable starting point.  What do you think?"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about 60/40? This way we both get a good share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much better deal than the last round, and it ensures we both get a good amount of money before inflation eats away at it further."
