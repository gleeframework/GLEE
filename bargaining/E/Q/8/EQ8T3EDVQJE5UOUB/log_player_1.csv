I'm going to start with an extremely lopsided offer.  I want to maximize my share in the first round, knowing that inflation will start to eat away at the value of the money if we don't reach an agreement.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept even a small amount rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is playing a very similar strategy to mine.  He's hoping I'll accept a small amount to avoid getting nothing. However, the inflation is going to hurt me more than him at this stage.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob, but still keep the majority of the money for myself.  I'm hoping that this offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering the inflation is starting to take effect.  I'm also trying to gauge his willingness to negotiate by seeing if he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really hitting me hard now, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.  I've already lost a significant portion of my potential earnings, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. While I'm not happy with this offer, I'm going to accept it.  I've learned that Bob is willing to negotiate, and I'm hoping that in future rounds, I can get a better deal."
