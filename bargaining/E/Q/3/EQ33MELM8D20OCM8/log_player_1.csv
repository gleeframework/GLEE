Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better deal, especially considering the inflation. Splitting it down the middle is a bit too generous for Bob, considering the money is worth less than it was in the first round. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
