"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I'm also being greedy. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! Alice is taking almost everything.  There's plenty of time to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm offering you a sizable share, but time is money (literally!). We can both walk away happy with this deal."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a bigger share. Let's see if you're willing to meet me halfway. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is moving in the right direction, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Given the inflation working against me, I need to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement towards a compromise. However, the clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at the value.  My offer is more than fair and gives us both a good share. Let's close this deal."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is of the essence, Bob. Let's be reasonable and secure a good sum for both of us. This offer is a fair compromise, let's finalize this before things get even more difficult. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is it.  Alice is unlikely to go any lower, and the value of the money is rapidly decreasing for me. Taking $400,000 now is better than risking getting zero or a severely diminished amount in later rounds."
