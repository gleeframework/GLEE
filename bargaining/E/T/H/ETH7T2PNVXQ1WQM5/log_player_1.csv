"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'll start by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fairly generous offer considering the inflation factor, and it gives Bob a chance to get something rather than nothing if he rejects.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though Bob is offering me less than in the first round, it's still worth rejecting.  This is a game of negotiation, and I'm not going to let him walk all over me. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
``` 

I'm proposing an 80/20 split in my favor.  Bob rejected my previous offer, and I'm confident he'll see that this is a fair deal considering the inflation.  If he rejects again, the stakes will only get higher in the next round.  Let's see if he accepts."
