Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly increasing her offer to Bob, but it's still not accounting for the rapid devaluation of her share.  While her offer seems ""more generous,"" the time pressure is on her more than Bob.  Bob can continue to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  A perfectly even split.  Take it now, or the deal is off the table.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a power play. Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate upwards, but she's still undervaluing the impact of the inflation on her share. Offering an even split seems generous on Bob's part, but it's actually a strong strategic move. It puts the pressure on Alice to accept a ""fair"" deal before the value of her potential gain diminishes further."
