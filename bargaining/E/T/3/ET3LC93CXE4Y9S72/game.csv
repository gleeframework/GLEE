650000.0,350000.0,"This offer leaves me with a comfortable amount after inflation, and gives you something rather than risking nothing later. What do you say, Bob?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"I propose a 50/50 split. It's fair, and avoids the risk of losing value with each passing round. Let's reach an agreement and secure our share of the money.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I appreciate the attempt at fairness, but the value decreases more for you than for me as we go. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to offset the inflation risk. This offer still gives you a significant sum.",Alice,3,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, we're losing money with each round. Let's find a compromise closer to a 50/50 split. I'm willing to meet you halfway at 450,000 for me and 550,000 for you. It's a fairer offer considering the inflation rate, and it gives us both a substantial amount.",Bob,4,

575000.0,425000.0,"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I've adjusted my offer slightly. It's crucial to remember the money loses value with each round, especially for you. This offer still ensures you get a good amount, and we avoid further losses.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
525000.0,475000.0,"Alice, time is running out. We're both losing money, and this gap between our offers is unsustainable. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a 475,000 for me and 525,000 for you. This acknowledges the inflation difference and gives us both a decent share before things get worse.",Bob,6,
