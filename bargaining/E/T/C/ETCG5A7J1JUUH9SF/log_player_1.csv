"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give it all away.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already kicking in!

I don't think splitting it down the middle is fair, considering I'm the one who made the first offer and I'm already losing value due to inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, but I'm willing to compromise. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 75% of the money and Bob gets 25%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 60/40 split. It's more in my favor, but still leaves a decent share for you.  Time is running out! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 60/40 split, especially since I'm already losing value at an alarming rate. I think I can do better than that.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5

  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, but I'm not. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of.""

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're getting close to the end, and the money keeps losing value. Let's make a deal - 70% for me, 30% for you. It's a good deal for both of us, and it's the best we can do. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is eating away at my potential gains, and Bob's offer is looking more appealing by the minute!

However, I'm still not comfortable with a 70/30 split. I think I can do better than that.
