"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 
I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I want to get the most I can in the first round, as the money will lose value in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a better deal, it's better to accept Bob's offer now.  The money is losing value quickly, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round."
