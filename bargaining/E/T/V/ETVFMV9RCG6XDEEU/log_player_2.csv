"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 10% inflation rate for me is a concern, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a larger share. Let's proceed to the next round where I'll make a proposal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55-45 split. Considering the inflation, this might be a fairer deal for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm hoping she'll consider the impact of inflation on her end and accept this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go 50/50 now, as inflation is impacting both of us. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on both of our potential gains, a 50/50 split seems reasonable at this point. The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round, so it's wise to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation."
