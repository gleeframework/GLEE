Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

""alice_gain"": 5463,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems we both want a slight advantage. I'm repeating your initial offer - this is your chance to accept it before inflation erodes it further. 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a tough one!  While I'd prefer my offer from Round 3, Bob is right that the value is eroding. Accepting his offer now gives me a slight advantage over a 50/50 split, which is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse deal in later rounds."
