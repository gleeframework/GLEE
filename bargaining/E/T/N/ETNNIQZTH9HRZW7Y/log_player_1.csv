"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the inflation rates. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, especially considering the different inflation rates. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation rates.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
