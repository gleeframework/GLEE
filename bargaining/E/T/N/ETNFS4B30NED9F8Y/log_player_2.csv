"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, $100 is equivalent to $80 for me. I'll make a proposal that gives me a slightly larger share.

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 36% less for me now, $100 is equivalent to $64 for me. I'll compare my potential gain in this offer to my potential gain in the next round, considering the decreasing value of money.

In the next round, the money will be worth 44% less than in the first round, making $100 equivalent to $56 for me. So, this offer is better than what I would get in the next round.
