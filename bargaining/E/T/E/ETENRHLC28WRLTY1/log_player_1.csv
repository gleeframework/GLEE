"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving 90 and Bob receiving 10. This seems like a fair initial offer given the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, it's important to remember the inflation factor. My gains are diminishing more rapidly than Bob's. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's only two rounds in."
