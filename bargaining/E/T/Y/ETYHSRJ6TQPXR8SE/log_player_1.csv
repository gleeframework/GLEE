Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. That way, we both get the same amount, and we don't need to play any further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer is a bit better for me than your last one.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a bit more than last time. Let's end this quickly and both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting worse for me with each round due to inflation disproportionately affecting him. He's feeling the pressure to settle.  While this offer isn't great, I'm still aiming to get more than 5000. I'll hold out a bit longer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, time is ticking!  This offer is pretty close to your last one.  Let's wrap this up.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm applying a bit more pressure now and moving closer to a 50/50 split. I want Bob to think I'm becoming more willing to settle as time goes on. However, I still believe I have leverage due to the inflation working in my favor."
