"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. Waiting for Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to take a little more since I'm only losing 5% per round, while you lose 20%. Let's be fair but still consider the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer, considering that even though Bob is being somewhat fair by acknowledging the inflation difference, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that suits me better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering my losses, I'll take a bit more. Still a good deal for you!""
}


I'm offering to take $5,800 and leave $4,200 for Bob, trying to find a balance between my increasing losses due to inflation and Bob's relatively lower losses. Waiting for Bob's response!"
