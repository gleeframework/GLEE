Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is far too unfair. I'll take my chances with the next round, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for inflation, but still leaving Bob with a decent share. I hope he'll be more reasonable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still too lopsided in Bob's favor. I'm willing to take my chances with another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer to account for inflation, but I'm still aiming for a more equitable split.  It's getting risky, but I believe there's still room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While it's getting closer, this offer still isn't fair enough considering the inflation I'm facing.  I'm going to push for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to account for the increasing inflation. I'm hoping that by offering a slightly larger share to Bob, he'll be more inclined to accept. It's a gamble, but the stakes are getting higher with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly stubborn. I still believe we can reach a more fair agreement, even with the increasing inflation. I'm going to keep pushing for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this round. The inflation is really starting to bite, and I need to get something for myself.  Hopefully, Bob will see that it's the most fair way to divide the money at this point."
