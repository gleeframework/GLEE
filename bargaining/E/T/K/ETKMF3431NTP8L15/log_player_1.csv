"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, let's split it 80-20""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we'll both face in future rounds. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","A 55-45 split is a good compromise, considering the inflation factor. I think I'll accept this offer.
