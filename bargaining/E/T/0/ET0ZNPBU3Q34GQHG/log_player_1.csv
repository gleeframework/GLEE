I'm going to be greedy in the first round and try to secure a large portion of the money. I'm offering Bob $100,000, hoping he'll accept it knowing he'll get nothing if we run out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a good deal for me. Even with the 5% inflation, I'm getting $100,000, which is better than nothing if we continue and I might not get anything in the end."
