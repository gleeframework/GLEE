"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering Bob $300,000, and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $700,000 is now worth $630,000, so I'm not as enthusiastic about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my $630,000 is now worth $561,000. I'll try to do better this time. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since my $630,000 from round 2 is now worth $461,100 (27.1% less), I'll consider this offer. Bob's offer is still a 50/50 split, but the value of my share has decreased due to inflation.
