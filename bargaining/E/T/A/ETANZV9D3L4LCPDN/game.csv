20.0,80.0,"You're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not going to give you 90% of the money so easily. I'll give you a smaller share this round, but don't expect it to get better from here.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"I understand you're playing hardball, Bob. But I'm not going to be taken advantage of. Let's be reasonable - this offer is more fair, and we can both walk away with a decent amount. Reject this, and we'll both be losing money with each passing round.",Alice,3,

70.0,30.0,"We're both losing money with each round. Let's stop playing games and split the money fairly. I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than the last offer, but I'm not going to let you take advantage of the inflation. This is a fair compromise, and we can both leave with a decent sum. Accept this, and we can both walk away with something.",Alice,5,
