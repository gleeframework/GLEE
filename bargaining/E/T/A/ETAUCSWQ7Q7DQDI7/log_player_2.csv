"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. Remember, with every round, the value of the money decreases, and we both lose.  Let's make this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us, but especially for me. Every round makes the potential winnings significantly smaller.
* **Alice's Compromise:**  Alice moved from a 90/10 split to a 55/45 split.  This shows a willingness to negotiate and acknowledges the impact of the inflation mechanism. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal in future rounds is very risky.  There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better split, and the value of any potential gain will be further diminished.

Accepting 450,000 now, even with the 36% inflation, is better than risking getting a much smaller amount later, or potentially reaching a stalemate and getting nothing.
