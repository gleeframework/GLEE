Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit greedy Alice! How about something a little more even? This offer is still generous to you. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
