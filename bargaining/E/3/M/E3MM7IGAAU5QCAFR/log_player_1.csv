I'm going to try and be greedy, but not too greedy.  I think 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob is a fair offer.  I'm expecting Bob to be a bit more reasonable and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though Bob's offer is giving me 300,000, after the inflation hit, that's only worth 240,000.  I can do better than that, especially considering Bob's offer is pretty generous to himself.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try and split the money more evenly this time. I think offering 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob is a good compromise, especially since we both know the money is worth less now due to inflation. Hopefully, Bob will be more reasonable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, this is getting a bit scary. After the inflation hit, Bob's offer of 450,000 is only worth 230,400 for me. It's not a lot, but it's better than nothing. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep rejecting offers and still get anything at all. I'll take it."
