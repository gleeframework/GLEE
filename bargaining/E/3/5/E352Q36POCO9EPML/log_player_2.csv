Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives you a good chunk and avoids us losing money to inflation.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2

{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I understand the need for a reasonable split, but your initial offer wasn't quite fair to me. Let's meet in the middle to avoid further devaluation.""

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise considering the inflation. It's better to take a slightly smaller cut now than risk losing even more. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
