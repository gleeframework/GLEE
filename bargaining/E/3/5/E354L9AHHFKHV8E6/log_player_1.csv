"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 80-20""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000. I think this is a fair split, considering we're starting with a large amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking. In this round, $5000 is actually worth $4500 in the previous round's value.

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best approach, but I'll accept this offer for now. I'll aim to do better in the next round.
