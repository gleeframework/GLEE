"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is 40% of the initial 100 dollars. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as thrilled about the 50-50 split. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
