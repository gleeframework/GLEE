"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
This is my first offer. I'm starting with a slightly unequal split, hoping Bob will accept.  I'll be keeping a larger share, but I'm also trying to be fair and give him a chance to get something. Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm not willing to risk losing everything.  Bob's offer is fair and I'm happy to accept a 50/50 split."
