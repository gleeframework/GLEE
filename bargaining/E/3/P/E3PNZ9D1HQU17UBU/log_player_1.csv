"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer is a little cheeky, but it's a good starting point. Alice gets almost everything, but Bob gets a tiny amount to consider. It's important to remember that the money is worth less with each passing round, so Alice needs to be aggressive early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 50/50 split seems fair, it's crucial to remember the inflation factor. Alice is losing 10% of the value of her share every round. Rejecting this offer means she gets another chance to make a proposal and potentially get a better deal for herself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

Alice still wants to maximize her share, but she needs to be more realistic. This offer gives Bob a significant amount but leaves Alice with the lion's share. With inflation in mind, Alice needs to strike a balance between getting a good deal for herself and ensuring the offer is enticing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is a significant shift in favor of him, Alice needs to be strategic.  Inflation is now hitting her hard (27.1% less value), and she needs to be extremely cautious about accepting an offer that gives her less than half the money.  She still has time and leverage to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

Alice is now facing significant inflation (27.1% less than the initial round), and she needs to be more realistic while still trying to maximize her share. This offer is a compromise - it offers Bob a more substantial share, but it still allows Alice to secure the majority of the money.  It's a gamble, but at this point, accepting a smaller share might be the best way to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's position is becoming increasingly precarious due to the escalating inflation.  While Bob's offer is heavily skewed in his favor, it's still better than getting nothing at all. However, Alice has two more rounds to make a proposal. There's still a chance to negotiate a better deal, and rejecting this offer keeps that option open.  If she rejects, her next offer needs to be very compelling to convince Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With inflation at 40.95%, Alice needs to secure a significant amount of money to avoid losing too much value. This offer is a 50/50 split, which is more likely to be accepted by Bob. While Alice loses a lot of potential value, she needs to be practical at this stage of the game. It's better to secure half the money than risk getting nothing at all."
