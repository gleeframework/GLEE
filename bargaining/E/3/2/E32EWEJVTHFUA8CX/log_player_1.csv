I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer, aiming for a large share of the money. I figure Bob might accept it, as it's still a decent amount for him. If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly playing a more strategic game than I anticipated.  While this offer is tempting in the short term, I believe I can get a better deal if I play it smart.  I'll need to adjust my strategy to account for the inflation and Bob's willingness to fight for a larger share.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm adjusting my strategy to be more moderate.  After Bob's aggressive counter-offer, I need to show that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm offering 6000 for myself, which is still a significant share, but it's a more reasonable split than my previous offer. Hopefully, this will get us closer to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting more aggressive, and while 4000 is still a decent amount, it's much lower than what I was aiming for.  I believe I can still get a better deal if I hold out.  The inflation is hurting, but I'm still confident that I can negotiate a more favorable outcome.  I'm going to reject this offer and see what Bob's next move is."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

It's time to be more reasonable. Bob's last offer clearly shows he's determined to get a larger share, and the inflation is taking its toll.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  It's fair, and hopefully, it will convince Bob to accept.  If not, I'll have to take a more serious look at the inflation factor and adjust my strategy further."
