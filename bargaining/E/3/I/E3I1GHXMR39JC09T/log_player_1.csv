# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
