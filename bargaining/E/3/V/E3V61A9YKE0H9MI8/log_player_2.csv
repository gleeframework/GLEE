Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims her offer is generous, the inflation is working heavily against me. Accepting this offer would mean I'm losing a significant chunk of the potential earnings. It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and the value is dropping.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical outcome at this point.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't ideal, it's getting dangerously close to the point where accepting a bad deal is better than getting nothing at all.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything significantly better at this stage."
