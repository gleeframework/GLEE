"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get something to start with.

""bob_gain"": 700000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'll give you more, but it needs to be closer to a 50/50 split. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better, accepting 200,000 now is a bad long-term strategy. Due to inflation, that 200,000 will be worth significantly less by the end of the game.  I need to push for a more favorable split while I still have leverage."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a middle ground.  My previous offer was generous, but I'm willing to meet closer to the middle.  This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to appear more flexible, but framing it as my ""final offer"" to apply pressure. This is a risky move, but with time (and value) slipping away, I need to take a stand."
