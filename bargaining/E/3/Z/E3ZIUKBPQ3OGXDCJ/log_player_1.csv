Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 55/45 split seems reasonable given the inflation. This ensures we both get a good share. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
