Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\n### I'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, considering the inflation will hurt me more than it hurts you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I'm not accepting Bob's offer. Given that the money is worth the same to me in this round as it was in the first round, and considering Bob's offer gives me less than what I initially proposed, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"

By proposing a 58-42 split, I'm showing willingness to compromise while still aiming for a favorable outcome. Let's see how Bob responds!"
