"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the larger share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $800,000 and Bob getting $200,000. The message is a straightforward explanation of the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this round, but I'm looking for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the new values are:

My gain: 400,000
Bob's gain: 480,000

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a better split than my previous proposal. I'll accept this offer.
