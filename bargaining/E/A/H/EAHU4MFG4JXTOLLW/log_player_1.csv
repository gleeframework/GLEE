"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable start""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60$ and Bob will get 40$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the high road, let's start with a 4:1 ratio, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* Alice gain: 20 * 0.8 = 16
* Bob gain: 80 * 0.8 = 64

I'll reject this offer since it's still a bit too skewed towards Bob. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too uneven, I'd like to propose a 50/50 split""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, the actual amounts I'm working with are:

* Alice gain: 16 * 0.8 = 12.8
* Bob gain: 64 * 0.8 = 51.2

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is a fair compromise""
}
```

This way, I'll get 55.2$ and Bob will get 44.8$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive stance, but I'm still willing to give you a decent share, don't want to leave you with nothing 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is getting out of hand!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* Alice gain: 10 * 0.516 = 5.16
* Bob gain: 90 * 0.516 = 46.48

I'll reject this offer since it's still a very uneven split. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still way too skewed towards you, I'd like to propose a 40/60 split""
}
