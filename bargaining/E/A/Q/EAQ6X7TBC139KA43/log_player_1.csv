Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 999,999 dollars and give Bob 1 dollar.  It's a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping he'll be happy with anything at all!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept this offer. While I would have loved to get more, Bob is getting a much larger share than I offered him. It's likely that he'll continue to ask for more in the future, so I'll take what I can get now."
