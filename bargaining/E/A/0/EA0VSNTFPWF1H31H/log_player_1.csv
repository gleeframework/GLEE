I'm taking a risk here, but I'm aiming for a large share early on. Hopefully, Bob will realize it's better to take a small piece than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take 50 now than risk getting nothing later. The inflation is starting to bite, and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer."
