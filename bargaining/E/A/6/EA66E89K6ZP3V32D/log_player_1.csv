"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the inflation rate is 20% for me and 5% for Bob, I need to adjust my perception of the offer.

My gain of $400,000 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $320,000.
Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $570,000.

Considering this, I'll make a decision:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to keep a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted values based on the inflation rates:

My gain of $300,000 is worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $153,600.
Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 85.74% of its original value, which is $857,800.

Considering this, I'll make a decision:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
