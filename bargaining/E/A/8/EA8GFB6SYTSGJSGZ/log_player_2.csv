Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 80, ""alice_gain"": 20, ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share this time""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, 40-60 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait, I think there's a mistake! The offer is the same as the first round, but the money is worth 19% less due to inflation. So, the actual amounts are:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, 40-60 
# Bob gain: 38.4 
# Alice gain: 61.6 

I'll reject this offer since it's not a good deal for me.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""I'll take most of it now""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Compromise, I'll take 30% 
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let me calculate the actual amounts due to inflation:
The money is worth 34.39% less than in the first round, so the total amount is 100 * (1 - 0.3439) = 65.61.

So, the actual amounts are:
# Alice's message: Compromise, I'll take 30% 
# Bob gain: 45.93 
# Alice gain: 19.68 

I'll accept this offer, it's a decent deal considering the inflation.
