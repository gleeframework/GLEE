Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I think 60-40 is a fair split, and we can get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","No way, I'm not accepting a worse deal than what I initially offered!
