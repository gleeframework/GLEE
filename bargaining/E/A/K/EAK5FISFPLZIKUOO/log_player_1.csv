Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, Alice. This time, it's my turn to be generous. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable this time, Bob. I'm willing to share a bit more, but let's not push our luck.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a better deal than you deserve, Alice.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While the offer is bad, the inflation is hurting me far more than it is hurting Bob. Accepting ensures I get at least some money, while rejecting could result in me getting nothing."
