I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000. I think this is a fair starting point, as it gives me the majority share, but still provides Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

``` 

I'm going to propose a 55/45 split, giving me $550,000 and Bob $450,000.  Since Bob rejected my first offer, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need to get a good share since the value of my money is decreasing faster."
