"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away all the money.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about we split it down the middle? 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to get a better deal now that the stakes are lower due to inflation.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm not willing to give up 2/3 of the money. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation again, my offer will be even more skewed towards me. Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my own gain. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I think I can still get a better deal. Let's try to meet in the middle again. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me in the middle now that the money is worth significantly less due to inflation.

I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
