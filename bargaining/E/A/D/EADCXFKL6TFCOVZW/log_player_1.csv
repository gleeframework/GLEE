I'll think about Bob's offer...

```

Considering Bob's final offer, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I feel I'm being taken advantage of by the inflation. A 30-70 split is extremely unfair, and I'd rather risk going to the next round and potentially getting a better deal. I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided split, especially considering the significant impact of inflation on my earnings."
