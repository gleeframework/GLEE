"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get it over with""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started and see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't get away with 50/50 that easily! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's got the upper hand now.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I don't want to give up 2/3 of the money just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I'll try to get a better deal this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'm willing to give you a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, hoping Bob will accept it."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but still too little for me! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not getting any younger, and the money is losing value fast. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or keep negotiating.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting late in the game, and the money is worth even less. I'll have to be careful not to give away too much.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Last chance to make a deal, don't leave me with scraps""
}
```

I'm making a slightly more generous offer, hoping Bob will finally accept and we can wrap this up."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not desperate yet, but I'll give you a chance to make it right 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It's getting dire. The money is losing value at an alarming rate, and I'm starting to feel the pinch.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I reject it, I might not get a better deal later on. On the other hand, accepting this offer means I'll have to settle for a relatively small share of the remaining money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's getting critical. The money is worth a fraction of what it was initially, and I'm running out of options.

I'll make a final, desperate offer, hoping Bob will take pity on me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, I'm practically begging you to accept this""
}
```

This is my best shot. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be left with almost nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of chances, Alice, get serious! 
# Alice gain: 3200 
# Bob gain: 6800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm almost out of options. The money is almost worthless at this point, and I'm starting to lose hope.

I'll have to swallow my pride and accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
