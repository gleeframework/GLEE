"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money. We can negotiate further if you don't like it.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a slightly more even split considering the potential for inflation. I'm willing to offer you 40% and keep 60% for myself. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to get me to accept the same offer as before, but I can see that he's trying to negotiate with the same numbers. However, I'm not going to fall for it.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a very creative offer, Bob. I'm willing to give you more, but I want 55% of the money. It's still a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 55% of the remaining money, which is $440,000, and keeping 45% for myself, which is $360,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. I'll give you 50% of the money, and we can call it a day.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, offering Bob 50% of the remaining money, which is $500,000, and keeping the same amount for myself."
