"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% of the money. We can negotiate further if you don't like it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 40% share is tempting, it's worth seeing if Alice is willing to give more, especially considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping for a slightly more even split considering the potential for inflation. I'm willing to offer you 40% and keep 60% for myself.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, Bob. I'll give you 50% of the money, and we can call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing. A 50/50 split is fair in this situation and accepting it is the best option to avoid the risk of further inflation."
