"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid going to a second round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we both have an equal say in this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my thinking.

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but it's a more generous offer than the 80/20 I proposed initially. I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob! This is my best offer.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, but with a twist - I'm taking the higher amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."
