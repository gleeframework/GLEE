"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth even less. I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the large difference in the split, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is taking its toll! My offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This is a 42-58 split, which I think is a reasonable compromise given the decreased value of my potential gain due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my potential gain! Considering the large difference in the split and the significant decrease in the value of my gain, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is really eating away at my potential gain! My offer for Round 5 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000
}
```

This is the same offer as Bob made in Round 2, but I'm hoping he'll accept it now that the stakes are even lower for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really devastating my potential gain! With the money I'd gain being worth only about 10% of its original value, I'm in a very weak bargaining position. Considering the significant difference in the split and the extremely low value of my potential gain, I'll decide to accept this offer.
