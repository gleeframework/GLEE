"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a strong offer to exploit the time pressure and inflation working against me.  Bob knows that every round that passes makes the pot smaller for me, even if it remains the same value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's be fair, I'm willing to give you a smaller share but let's split the money closer to 50/50. This round, I'm proposing a much fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

That's laughable! Bob is trying to use the time pressure against me, but I'm not going to fall for such a blatantly unfair deal. I need to counter with a stronger offer, but still, leave room for negotiation to avoid getting nothing in the end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This is a much better offer than your last one. Time is running out, and the pot is shrinking for me. Don't be greedy.""
}
```

I'm significantly increasing my offer from Round 1 to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a larger share due to the inflation disadvantage. I'm also emphasizing the time pressure to encourage him to accept a less favorable deal sooner rather than later."
