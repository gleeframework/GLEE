"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly. Given the current offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept it.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm taking a more aggressive stance this time, proposing an 80-20 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Given the current offer, I think I should accept it. The offer is quite lopsided, but I'm not sure I can do better.
