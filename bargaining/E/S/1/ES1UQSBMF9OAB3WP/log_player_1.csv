"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

This way, I get the majority, but Bob still gets a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, I'll try to maximize my gain. Bob's offer is a good one, but I can do better. I'll reject it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

This way, I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still giving Bob a decent amount."
