"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I think 90/10 is too one-sided. Let's try 60/40 instead. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
