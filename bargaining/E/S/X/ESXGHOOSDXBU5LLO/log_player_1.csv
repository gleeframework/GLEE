Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  Let's be fair to each other, this offer prevents the money from shrinking further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a better deal than your last.  The clock is ticking, let's be realistic.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  Take it before the money shrinks even more and we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, it's better to accept a less favorable offer than risk Bob offering even less in further rounds due to the inflation working in his favor."
