"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can adjust from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain in this round are:

* My gain: $50 * 0.8 (20% less than the original $60) = $40
* Bob's gain: $50 * 0.95 (5% less than the original $53.33, which is 40/0.8) = $47.65

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best strategy, considering the inflation. I'd like to try to get a bit more, but I don't want to reject this offer and risk getting nothing.

I'll accept this offer for now.
