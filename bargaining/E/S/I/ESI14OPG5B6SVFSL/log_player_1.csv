"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept this as a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The 5% decrease in value for me is less significant than the 20% decrease for Bob, giving me more negotiating power."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since the money is worth less for Bob than for me due to the higher inflation rate he's experiencing, I'll adjust the offer accordingly to try and reach a mutually agreeable deal.\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\n###"
