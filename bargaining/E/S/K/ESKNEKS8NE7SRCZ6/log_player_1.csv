"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 10% less than the original $100, so I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best deal for me, and I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and Bob's offer was already 5% less than the original, I'll try to make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 58-42 split, which is a slight improvement from my initial offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really kicking in! With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original $100, I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this is a good deal, given the current state of the economy. I'll take the 52% and call it a day!"
