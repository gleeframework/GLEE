"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slight majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100 dollars, which is 60 dollars, and Bob gets 40% or 40 dollars. I'm framing it as a ""slight majority"" to make it sound like I'm being generous, but still getting a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should both get a fair amount, but I'll be taking a slightly larger portion this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't like the fact that Bob is taking a larger portion again. I'm trying to get a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more this time""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining 100 dollars, which is 55 dollars, and Bob gets 45% or 45 dollars. I'm framing it as a ""compromise"" to make it sound like I'm being reasonable, but still trying to get a slightly larger share."
