Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share is worth less each round. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This offer is better than the previous one and the inflation is eating into potential gains. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share."
