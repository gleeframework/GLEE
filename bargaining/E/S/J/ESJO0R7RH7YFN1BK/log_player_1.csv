"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd rather take a smaller share of the reduced amount. I accept the offer.
