"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

Initially, Bob's offer was $6000 for me, but due to inflation, that's equivalent to $6000 / 0.9 = $6666.67 in the first round's value.

I'll accept Bob's offer, since I'd get $4000, which is more than my initial offer of $3600 in the first round's value ($6000 / 1.67).
