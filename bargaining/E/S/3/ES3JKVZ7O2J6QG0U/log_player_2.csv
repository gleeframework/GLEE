I'm not going to accept a 60/40 split, especially since I know the money is going to be worth less for me in the next round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."

``` 
I'm still not happy with the split. Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm willing to wait a few more rounds. I'll see if I can get a better offer."

```

Alice is really pushing the boundaries with these offers. I'm not going to give in yet. There are still a few rounds left and I'm hoping she'll realize that pushing me too hard isn't a good strategy in the long run."

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not going to accept an offer that gives Alice such a large share, especially when the money is worth so much less for me. I'm holding out hope that she'll realize it's better for both of us to negotiate a fairer split before it's too late."

I know the situation is dire, and the money is worth very little for me now, but I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'm going to risk it all and see if I can get a better deal in the final round."

``` 

I'm making a final push for a slightly better split.  I'm taking a huge loss, but at least it's something. Hopefully, Alice will realize that it's better to settle than risk both of us getting nothing."
