This is a classic example of the ultimatum game.  In a perfectly rational world, Bob should accept any offer, even a tiny amount, because something is better than nothing. However, humans are not perfectly rational, and fairness plays a significant role in our decision-making. 

In this case, Alice's offer is perfectly fair, and Bob has no reason to reject it."
