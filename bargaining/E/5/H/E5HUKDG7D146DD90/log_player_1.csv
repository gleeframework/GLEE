"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my sense of fairness dictates a 50/50 split.  Let's close this out and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation means I'll actually be getting less value. It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm feeling the inflation pinch. This offer ensures I get a decent share while still giving you a good chunk.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've increased my share slightly from the initial offer to compensate for the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will be more agreeable to this offer now that he sees I'm willing to negotiate, but also serious about getting a fair deal considering the shrinking pot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It gives you a slight edge considering the inflation, and we both walk away with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is really starting to bite now. While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's better than what I'd get if I reject and he offers an even worse split in the next round. It's a compromise, but considering the circumstances, it's the most logical choice to secure a reasonable amount."
