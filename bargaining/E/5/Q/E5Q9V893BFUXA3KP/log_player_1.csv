"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, right?""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share, and we can avoid any potential disputes. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power.

With inflation, the money I gain is still worth 50, but the money Bob gains is worth 54 (60 * 0.9). This means that Bob's offer is effectively giving me 50/54 = 0.926 of the total value, while he's getting 60/54 = 1.111 of the total value.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this unequal split, especially since I'm not getting a clear explanation for why Bob thinks he deserves more. I'll reject this offer and see what happens next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit one-sided, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. I'll give him a slightly smaller share, but still a decent chunk.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think 45 is a fair share for me.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a bigger risk, so I need a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, let's analyze Bob's offer. With inflation, the money Bob gains is now worth 73 (70 * 0.9029), and the money I gain is still worth 50.

This means that Bob's offer is giving me 50/83 = 0.602 of the total value, while he's getting 70/83 = 0.843 of the total value. This is an even more unequal split than before!

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this, especially since Bob claims he's taking a bigger risk. I'd like to see some explanation for what kind of risk he's taking and why it warrants a 70/30 split. For now, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was even more one-sided than before, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. I'll give him a smaller share, but still a decent chunk.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a 60% share. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
