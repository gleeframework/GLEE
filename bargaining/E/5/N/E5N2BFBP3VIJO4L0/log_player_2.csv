This is a tough one, but I'll accept. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** This is the last round. If I reject, we both get nothing.
* **Alice's Perspective:** The value of the money has significantly decreased for Alice due to inflation.  While 6000 might seem high from my perspective, it's worth much less to her now. 
* **Something is better than nothing:**  Getting $4000 is better than the risk of getting $0 by rejecting and ending the game with no deal."
