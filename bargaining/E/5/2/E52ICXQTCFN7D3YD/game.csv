40.0,60.0,"I think a 60/40 split is fair, with me getting the bigger share since I'm the one making the proposal this round.  Let's get this done!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 in your favor isn't fair. How about 55/45?  The clock is ticking!",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
30.0,70.0,"We're getting close to the end, and this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it, but I'm not going lower.  Time is money!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 50/50 split to end this now. Don't be greedy! We both lose if this goes on much longer.",Alice,5,
