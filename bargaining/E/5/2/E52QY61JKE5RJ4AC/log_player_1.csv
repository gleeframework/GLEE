"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid going into the second round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too generous, I'll take a more moderate split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll get 50 * 0.8 = 40 dollars, and Bob will get 50 dollars.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round (80% of 80% = 64%), I'll propose a split that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy! I'll offer you a decent split, but don't expect any more generosity from me.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round (52.2% of 80% = 41.76%), I'll get 45 * 0.412 = 18.55 dollars, and Bob will get 55 dollars.
