"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. I take $700,000, you take $300,000. It's a good offer for you right now, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, Alice. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  Think of it as a finder's fee for this million dollars.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, literally! My offer from round 1 is off the table.  I'll take $650,000, you get $350,000. It's still a decent chunk, especially with inflation eating away at your share. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting worse, accepting now would mean I get a significantly smaller amount than Alice.  It's worth the risk of another round of inflation to try and negotiate a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This back and forth is hurting both of us. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair deal that acknowledges the time pressure we're both under.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this. I understand the inflation is working in my favor, but I'm still offering you a sizable portion. $380,000 is better than nothing, which is what you'll have if we don't agree soon. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much further, and the inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. Accepting $380,000 now is far better than risking another round and potentially ending up with an even smaller share, or even nothing at all."
