450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, let's be realistic. This back and forth is hurting both of us. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair deal that acknowledges the time pressure we're both under.",Bob,4,

620000.0,380000.0,"Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this. I understand the inflation is working in my favor, but I'm still offering you a sizable portion. $380,000 is better than nothing, which is what you'll have if we don't agree soon.",Alice,5,
