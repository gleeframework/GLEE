{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60 and you can take 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair and straightforward offer."

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting worried about the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, but I'm not ready to give in to Bob's demands just yet. His offer is very lopsided, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a more balanced split."

I'm trying to find a compromise that will satisfy Bob's desire for a bigger share, while still giving me a decent portion of the remaining money."

# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting desperate too, but I'm not willing to accept such an extremely lopsided offer. 10% of the remaining money is not enough for me, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal, even if it's my last chance."

{""alice_gain"": 25, ""bob_gain"": 75, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate too, but I'm not willing to give up yet. I'll take 25 and you can take 75. It's a big sacrifice, but I think it's worth it to avoid getting nothing.""}

I'm trying to find a compromise that will give Bob a significant portion of the remaining money, but still leave me with a decent amount. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
