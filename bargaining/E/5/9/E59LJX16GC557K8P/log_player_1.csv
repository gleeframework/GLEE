"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share this round, but expect a bigger cut next round 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to be strategic.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only $3000 this round, but I'm willing to play along. I'll accept the offer for now, hoping to negotiate a better deal in future rounds.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
