Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's be fair, I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share considering the inflation, but it needs to be reasonable for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500
