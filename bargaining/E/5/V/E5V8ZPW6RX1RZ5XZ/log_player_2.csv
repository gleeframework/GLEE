""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's be fair, I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share considering the inflation, but it needs to be reasonable for both of us.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we need to find a middle ground quickly. Inflation is eating away at the value.  Let's split it evenly, 50/50.  It's the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
