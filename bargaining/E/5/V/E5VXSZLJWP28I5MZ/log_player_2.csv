**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but at this point, the relentless inflation makes it foolish to refuse. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Every round, my potential gain shrinks significantly.  
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  Alice seems content to wait me out, knowing the longer the game goes, the more advantageous her position becomes.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While $3,800 is far from ideal, it's better than risking another round where Alice might offer even less, or where I'm forced to accept a pittance just to avoid walking away with nothing."
