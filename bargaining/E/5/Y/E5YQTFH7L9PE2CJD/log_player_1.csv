"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'll start by offering a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this first offer, as it's a good starting point, but I'm also aware that the money will be worth less with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant improvement from my initial proposal, but it still feels too favorable to him. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. Even with the inflation, I'm confident I can negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to compromise, I believe this offer is fair considering the inflation that has occurred and the fact that I'm now the one proposing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one. Inflation has really eaten into the value of the money, and I'm likely to see a further decrease in the next round.  While I'd prefer a more even split, Bob's offer is the best I'm likely to get at this point. I'll accept it."
