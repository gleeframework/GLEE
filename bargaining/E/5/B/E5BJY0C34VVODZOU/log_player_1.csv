Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer. I want to see how much Bob values even a small amount of money in the face of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Bob is taking most of the money, it's still a significant amount for me, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round with inflation."
