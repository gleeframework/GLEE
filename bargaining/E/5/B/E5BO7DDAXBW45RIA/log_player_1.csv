Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a middle ground, Alice. We both lose if we keep going! 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Come on, Alice! We're both losing a lot of value here. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
After round 4, Bob's offers are likely to get worse from my perspective as the relative value shifts in his favor. Accepting now locks in a reasonable sum before inflation further erodes my potential gains."
