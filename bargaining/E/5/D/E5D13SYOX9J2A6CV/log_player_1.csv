Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm not going to give away the majority. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give you the majority now that the money is worth less. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure something rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
