# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm rejecting this offer, Bob. It's too early in the game to settle for such a small share.  Let's see if we can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value fast. This offer is still generous, but we need to act quickly. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting this offer, Alice.  The money is losing value, but I'm not convinced that we need to settle for such a small share so early in the game. Let's see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. We're both losing money with each passing round.  A 50/50 split is fair, and it allows us to walk away with a decent share.""}
