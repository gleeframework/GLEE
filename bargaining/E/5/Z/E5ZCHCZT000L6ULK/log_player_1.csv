I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further rounds and inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting, my share is very small, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. The inflation is working against me, but I'm still willing to hold out for more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing an even split.  Inflation is getting worse, and it's becoming less likely that either of us will get a significantly larger share.  I'm hoping Bob will see the logic in accepting a fair deal to avoid further losses."
