"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while accounting for potential future value loss due to inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. This gives us both a decent share and allows for some buffer in case the money loses value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
