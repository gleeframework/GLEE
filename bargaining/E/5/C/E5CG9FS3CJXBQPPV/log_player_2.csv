Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm happy to finally accept an offer! It looks like Alice has come around to seeing the sense in splitting the money evenly, considering the significant loss in value due to inflation. I'm glad we could come to a mutually agreeable decision before the 12 rounds were up. Now, let's just hope the money is still worth something!\n\n###\n\nIs the game over? Did I win?"
