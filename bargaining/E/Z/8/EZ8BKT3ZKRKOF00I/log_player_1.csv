"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 100, you get 0. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm making a bold move, asking Bob to accept a 100% share for me and a 0% share for himself. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will see the humor in it and accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 50/50 split. This ensures fairness for both of us. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable proposal, but I'm not ready to settle yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to split it down the middle just yet. I'll make a new offer in the next round.""
}
```

I'll think about a new proposal for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth less than before. Since Bob's share is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share for myself this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70% of the remaining value, leaving you with 30%. Your turn to respond!""
}
```"
