Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty uneven split. I figure I'll be the proposer in the first round, so I'll try to get the majority of the money.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if I reject it."
