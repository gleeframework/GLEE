I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he accepts it and we can both get a large share of the money.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much fairer than my first one, but I think I can still do better.  I'm going to reject and see if I can get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 400,000.  This is still a significant amount of money for him, and it allows me to get a larger share. I think this is a good balance between fairness and getting the most for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. However, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more aggressive offer this round.  With the inflation hitting us both hard, I think Bob might be more willing to accept something closer to what I want.  Hopefully, we can reach a deal before the money gets too much less valuable!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair, and the inflation is really hurting us both.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time limit, but I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm taking a risk here.  The inflation is becoming a major factor, and I need to make sure I get a decent share before it's too late. This offer gives Bob a smaller portion, but it's still a significant amount, and it's my best shot at getting a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going for broke. The inflation is really hurting us both, and I need to get a large share of the money before it's too late. This offer might be too aggressive, but I'm willing to risk it to get a decent amount of money.  Let's see if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting ridiculous. Bob's offer is just too unfair, and the inflation is really starting to bite.  I'm going to reject this and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, even though it feels like we're both going to lose a lot of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're down to the wire, and the inflation has taken a huge bite out of our potential gains.  I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option at this point, and it might be the only way we can both get something.  Let's see if Bob is finally ready to compromise."
