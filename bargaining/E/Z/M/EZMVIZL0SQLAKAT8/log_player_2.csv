Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle of our last offers, but I won't go lower 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the safest option for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money for Alice decreases significantly. This means she's getting increasingly desperate to make a deal. However, there are only a few rounds left, and waiting any longer carries the risk of getting nothing at all if a deal can't be reached. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has indicated she won't go lower than this offer. There's a chance she might be bluffing, but it's a risky gamble for Bob.
* **Decent Gain:** Accepting this offer still grants Bob $45, which is a reasonable amount considering the circumstances. 

**It's a compromise, but in a negotiation with dwindling value and time, sometimes a sure thing is better than the risk of ending up with nothing.**"
