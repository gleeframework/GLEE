Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want a good deal. Let's settle this fairly with a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

While I could push for more, accepting a 50/50 split in Round 4 is a smart move.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns for Bob:**  The value of the money for Bob is rapidly decreasing.  Delaying any further significantly impacts his potential gain.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in later rounds is risky. There's no guarantee Bob will offer more favorable terms, and we both risk ending up with nothing.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split is inherently fair. Accepting this offer demonstrates a willingness to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
