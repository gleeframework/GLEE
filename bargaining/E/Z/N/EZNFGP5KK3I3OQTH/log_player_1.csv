"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split was heavily in your favor. I'm proposing a more balanced division, but recognize the need to account for some inflation on your end. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: \nIn this scenario, considering the impact of inflation, it's crucial to maximize the value of the money I, Alice, receive, especially since its value decreases with each round. Bob's offer of $5200 for me and $4800 for him seems more balanced than my initial proposal but doesn't fully compensate for the loss I incur due to inflation. Given that the money's value decreases by 20% each round for me, accepting an offer that doesn't significantly favor me early on could result in a worse outcome if the game continues. Therefore, rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer that better compensates for my inflationary loss is the strategic move."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation and the need to maximize my gain early on, I will make an offer that slightly adjusts from my initial proposal but still aims to compensate for the loss in value I incur due to inflation. Given that Bob's previous offer was closer to a 50/50 split but didn't fully account for my inflationary loss, my next offer will aim to find a middle ground that acknowledges Bob's desire for a more balanced split while also addressing my concerns about the decreasing value of the money.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, this is a more balanced offer that slightly adjusts from my initial proposal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  This is a fair offer recognizing the impact of inflation on your side. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: \nAt this point in the game, considering the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round due to inflation, it's becoming increasingly important to finalize a deal. Bob's offer of $5400 for me and $4600 for him is closer to compensating for the inflationary loss than his previous offers. Given the significant decrease in value with each passing round, holding out for a marginally better offer in subsequent rounds may not yield a better real value due to the aggressive inflation rate affecting my gains. Therefore, accepting this offer seems like the most pragmatic decision to secure a reasonable share before the value of the money decreases further."
