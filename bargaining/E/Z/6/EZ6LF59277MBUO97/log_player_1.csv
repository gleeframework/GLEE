"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start with!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This seems like a fair starting point, and it's a good way to get the ball rolling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to make a tough decision.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but don't get too comfortable!""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent chunk for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
