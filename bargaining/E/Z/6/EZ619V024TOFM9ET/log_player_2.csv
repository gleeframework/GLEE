Please go ahead and let me know what Alice proposes in the next round. I'm ready to respond."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I think 58/42 is more than fair considering the inflation!""} ###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly. Inflation is hitting us both, so this seems like the fairest solution now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think an even split is a good deal at this point, considering the inflation. It's better to accept this offer than to risk losing more value in the next round.###"
