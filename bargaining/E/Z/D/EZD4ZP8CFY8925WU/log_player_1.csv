"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's start with a fair offer. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This gives us both a good amount of money right now.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** I need to factor in the inflation that affects me. Taking a decent offer now is better than potentially getting a slightly better offer later when the value has decreased.
* **Fairness:** While I am aware of the inflation disadvantage, I don't want to start too aggressively. A 60/40 split seems like a reasonable starting point that Bob might consider. 
* **Simplicity:**  I want to keep the message clear and concise to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was a bit imbalanced. Let's be practical - this split recognizes the time pressure while still giving you a larger share. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is slightly better than my initial offer if we don't factor in inflation. However, due to the 20% decrease in value for me, his offer is essentially the same as if I accepted my initial offer last round, which wasn't favorable enough to begin with.  I need to push for a larger share while being mindful that time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, we need to find a solution quickly.  I'm proposing a 65/35 split. This accounts for the time pressure and still provides a reasonable amount for you.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Urgency:**  With each passing round, the inflation eats into my potential gains. I need to increase my ask to compensate for this.
* **Strategic Concession:** While I increased my share, I also made a slight concession from my Round 1 offer. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate but need him to move as well.
* **Simplified Messaging:** I'm keeping the message focused on the need for a quick resolution and the key points of the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to be fair, but this needs to be a two-way street. This offer acknowledges the time pressure and gives us both a decent outcome. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming a significant factor now. While Bob's offer has inched upwards, it's simply not enough to compensate for the decreasing value of the money for me. Accepting his current offer would be worse than if I had accepted my own offer in Round 1.  I need to hold firm and hope he recognizes the shrinking pot."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 7000,
""bob_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money in this scenario, and it's disappearing fast. This offer is more than fair considering the circumstances."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Stance:** I need to send a clear message that Bob's slow concessions aren't working. A 70/30 split is a strong move, but necessary considering the inflation.
* **Focus on Time Pressure:**  By highlighting the shrinking pot, I am hoping to push Bob towards a more realistic assessment of the situation. 
* **Limited Negotiation:** I'm leaving less room for negotiation with this offer. I need Bob to understand the seriousness of the situation and that my offers will only get worse for him with time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and every round costs you significantly more than it costs me.  I'm proposing a simple, fair 50/50 split. Let's end this before the inflation eats away at your share even more. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Critical Inflation Point:** The inflation has reached a critical level. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking further rounds where even a larger percentage might end up being worth significantly less.
* **Bob's Changed Tune:** Bob's message indicates he is finally acknowledging the time pressure and its impact on my share. He is unlikely to offer significantly more than this.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  While I'd prefer a larger share, continuing to play risks getting nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds. A 50/50 split guarantees a reasonable payout at this point."
