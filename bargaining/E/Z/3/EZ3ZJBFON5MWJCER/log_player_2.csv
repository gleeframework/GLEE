Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance for a good deal!

# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot.  While the deal is slightly better than her last, accepting now would reward her stubbornness. I'm willing to gamble that she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the threat of getting $0 looms larger."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has shifted. While I'm holding out for a better deal, the impact of inflation is becoming too significant. Accepting 44 now is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds, even if Alice is getting a favorable split."
