Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's compromise. I'll take a bit less than last time, but we both get a good chunk of money.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You took 45 this time, I'll take even more this time, it's my turn to make a strong offer 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** With each round, my potential earnings are dropping drastically.  At this rate, if I reject and go another round, I'm likely to get even less.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob is clearly aiming for a larger share.  He's increasing his take with each round, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the future.
* **Minimizing Losses:**  While this offer is significantly less than what I initially wanted, it's still better than getting nothing if we reach the end of the game and neither of us agree. 

It's a tough call, but accepting ensures I get *some* money instead of potentially risking getting nothing."
