Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split. I believe this is fair as I am taking a bigger risk by going first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation rate is working against me. I'll accept the offer, knowing I'll get a better share in the future."
