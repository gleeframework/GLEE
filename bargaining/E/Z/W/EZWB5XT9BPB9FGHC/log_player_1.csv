"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money, which is $900,000, and Bob gets the remaining 10%, which is $100,000. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be fair, your turn! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll get $500,000, which is 50% of the original amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
