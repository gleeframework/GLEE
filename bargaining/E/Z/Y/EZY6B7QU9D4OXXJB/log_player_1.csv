"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You'll get $4000, I'll get $6000. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but it's still a reasonable split. Your turn!"

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now, but I'm not sure I want to split it 50-50. I'd like to make a counteroffer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50-50 is fair, considering the initial offer I made. I'll propose a new deal: 55-45 in my favor. I'll get $5500, you'll get $4500. What do you say?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate. I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'll get the majority. I'll get $6500, you'll get $3500. This is my last offer. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"

```
