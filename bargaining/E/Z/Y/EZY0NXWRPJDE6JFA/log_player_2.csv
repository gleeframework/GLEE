"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a counteroffer. Since Alice's initial offer was 50/50, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Considering the 10% inflation, I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation! I'll think carefully...

Since the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a higher percentage of the remaining amount to compensate for the loss. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 19% decrease in the value of the money I gain, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount. I'll propose:

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 525000 
# Alice gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting! With the money I gain being worth 34.39% less than in the first round, I need to be careful not to get too greedy. However, Alice's offer is still relatively close to the initial 50/50 split, and considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll think it's a good opportunity to accept.
