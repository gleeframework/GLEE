"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering to split the money evenly, 50-50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd gain $400,000, but due to the inflation, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. That's equivalent to $360,000 in the first round.

I'd rather not accept this offer, since I could have gotten $500,000 in the first round, which is more than what I'd get now.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With Bob's offer, I'd gain $300,000, but due to the inflation, the money is worth the same as in the first round. However, Bob would gain $700,000, which is worth 72.9% of what he would have gained in the first round.

I'd rather not accept this offer, since I could have gotten $500,000 in the first round, which is more than what I'd get now.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 4 was 70-30 in his favor, I'll try to make a more even split. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000
}"
