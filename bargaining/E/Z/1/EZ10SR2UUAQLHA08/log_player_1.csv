"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have the rest 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, but I'm not too thrilled with Bob's offer. I'd rather negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob took a larger share in the previous round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a bit more. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering a 40/60 split, which is closer to the original 55/45 split I proposed in the first round, but with a slightly larger share for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth even less, but I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer. I'd like to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer this time. With the money being worth less and less, I'd like to get a bigger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a better deal. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm offering a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me. Let's see if Bob will accept."
