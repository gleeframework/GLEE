"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. This is a fair starting point, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,750.

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,625.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, Bob. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, which is a 55-45 split. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I want. Can we meet at 52-48? It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less due to inflation, my gain of $4,800 is actually worth $4,131.20.

I'm not thrilled about the 52-48 split, but I think it's getting close to a fair compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer and thinking that $4,131.20 is a reasonable gain for me, considering the inflation and the negotiation process."
