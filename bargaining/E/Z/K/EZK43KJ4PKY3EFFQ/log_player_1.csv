"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer of $5,000 each, I'll accept this proposal.
