Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split. The money is worth less with each passing round, so let's come to an agreement quickly.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both lose money with each round, so a 50/50 split is the fairest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think a 50/50 split is a fair deal, considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation."
