650000.0,350000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. A 65/35 split seems like a good starting point. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"How about a 55/45 split? It's closer to equal, considering the inflation penalty is higher for Alice.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, that's still a bit too low for me. How about 60/40?  The inflation is hitting me harder, and this offer reflects that.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Considering the inflation impact, I think a 58/42 split is more reasonable now.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, we're getting closer, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's settle at 55/45.  This split acknowledges the time pressure we're both under.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Given the significant inflation impact on both of us, I believe a 52/48 split is a fair compromise at this point.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
530000.0,470000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time, and this is impacting us both. I'm willing to come down to a 53/47 split, but I need you to meet me halfway.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Considering we're more than halfway through and the inflation is severely impacting the value, I propose a 50/50 split to simplify the decision and account for the time pressure.",Bob,8,
