"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

This means I'm offering to take 550,000 dollars for myself and give Bob 450,000 dollars. It's a 55-45 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my share of 400,000 is worth even less than before, and Bob's share of 600,000 is worth less than his original offer in round 1. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation has been going on for two rounds, my share is worth significantly less now. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

This time, I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! My share of 300,000 is worth a lot less than before, but it's still a significant amount. Bob's share of 700,000 is also worth less than his previous offer, but it's a bigger share of the reduced total. I'll think carefully about this one...
