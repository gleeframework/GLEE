"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI am offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the total amount. Given the inflation rates, it's in both our interests to conclude the game quickly. I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in this offer and accept it, ensuring we both walk away with a substantial amount before the value of the money decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to start with a slightly more even split.  Let's see how this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nBob's offer gives me $450,000, which is less than what I initially offered him. Considering the inflation, accepting this would mean I lose more value compared to if we had settled in the first round. I believe I can negotiate for a better split, so I'm rejecting this offer and proceeding to the next round to make a counteroffer that might be more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll consider the impact of inflation on both our gains and try to find a middle ground that might appeal to Bob while still being favorable to me. Given that the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm hoping Bob will see the sense in accepting this offer rather than risking further devaluation.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}"
