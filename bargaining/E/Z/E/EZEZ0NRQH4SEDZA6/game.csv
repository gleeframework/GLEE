990000.0,10000.0,Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 99% and you get the remaining 1%.  We can adjust later if needed.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"That's a very generous offer, Alice, but I think we can be a bit fairer. How about a 70/30 split in my favor?  It accounts for the time value of money with the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Let's be reasonable here. I'll take 60%, but I think we can both do better than the previous offers.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Okay, Alice, I see your point. How about a 60/40 split in my favor? That feels like a good compromise considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least 55% of the money. Let's meet in the middle.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
430000.0,570000.0,"Alice, time is running out, and the deal is getting worse for me with each round. I'm proposing a 57/43 split in my favor.  This is a compromise, and it accounts for the inflation working against me.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"I'm still holding out for a bigger share. I'm willing to go down to 52%, but I won't go lower. Let's settle this before it's too late.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a 55/45 split, meeting you closer to the middle.  We need to agree soon, or we both lose!",Bob,8,
