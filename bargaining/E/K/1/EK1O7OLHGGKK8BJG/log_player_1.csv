"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, and I'm leaving the door open for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for future inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. I'm not sure I want to give up 45% of the remaining amount. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim for a slightly better share than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55% is a bit steep. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55.5/44.5 split, which is closer to my original offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
