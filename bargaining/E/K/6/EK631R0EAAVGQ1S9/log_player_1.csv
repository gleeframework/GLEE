"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, I'll take the lead and propose 80-20. Accept and we can end this!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. The message is a friendly nudge to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is a more equitable starting point. It's closer to an even split, and allows for a bit of room for negotiation in the future. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $45 is worth 5% less than the $80 I would have gotten in Round 1, so it's equivalent to $76.80 in Round 1 terms.

I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than I expected, but I'll play it safe and try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in Round 3. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so my gain of $76.80 is worth 10% less, which is equivalent to $69.48 in Round 2 terms, or $69.48 / 0.95 = $73.15 in Round 3 terms.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal than Bob's previous offer, while still being somewhat reasonable."
