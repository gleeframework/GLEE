"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to make the game worthwhile for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's offer is now 40% of the original amount, I'll consider it a better deal than my initial offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
