Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Inflation is costing me! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm still holding strong. While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, I'm aiming to secure a slightly larger share. I'll continue to leverage the impact of inflation on her gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's end this. An even split is the most logical choice. Take it before inflation makes your share even smaller!"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I was aiming for a slight advantage, it's time to be realistic.  Alice is getting desperate, but she's unlikely to accept an offer where she gets significantly less.  A 50/50 split is fair and gives her a strong incentive to accept before she loses even more to inflation."
