"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's try 55/45, more fair for me""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### \n\nSince the value of money decreases by 20% each round, in Round 3, the original $1,000,000 is worth 64% of its original value, or $640,000. Splitting it evenly would give each player $320,000 in original value. Given the decreasing value and the offer being exactly even, accepting this offer seems reasonable to stop further devaluation of the money."
