"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take most of the money, but I'm willing to give you a small portion to get us started. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit ridiculous. Let's be fair - I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Time is ticking and inflation is eating away at our potential gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise.  A 50/50 split is fair, given the inflation we're dealing with.  Accepting this offer means we both get something, and it avoids further losses. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors Alice. Accepting this offer now means I lose out on potential gains I could make by negotiating a larger share for myself in later rounds. I need to push for a better deal while I still have leverage."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out and inflation is hurting both of us, though it's clearly hitting me harder.  You've rejected a 60/40 split, so I'm proposing 70/30.  Let's end this now and both walk away with something substantial.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every round.  I'm willing to compromise again and accept a 60/40 split in your favor, but this is my final offer.  Let's end this now before we both lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally conceding to a deal that favors me. While I'd prefer the 70/30 split, accepting this offer guarantees a good payout before inflation erodes it further.  The potential gains from continuing to negotiate aren't worth the risk of walking away with nothing if Alice sticks to her ""final offer"" stance."
