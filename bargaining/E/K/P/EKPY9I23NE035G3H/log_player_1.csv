"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6000, which is 60%. This is a relatively fair division, considering that I'm making the first offer. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair, even if the money is shrinking a bit for me! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, his $5000 is actually worth less than the original $5000, while my gain remains the same. I believe I can make a better offer in the next round or get a more favorable deal later on. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share, taking into account the inflation that's affecting his gains. I'll also try to create a sense of urgency, reminding him that the money is losing value for him with each passing round.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Don't let the money slip away!""}\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
