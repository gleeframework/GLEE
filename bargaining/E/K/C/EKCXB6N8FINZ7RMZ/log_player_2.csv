I'm not going to accept that offer. Even though it's a lot of money, I can try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 
I'm offering Alice 400,000 and keeping 600,000 for myself. This seems like a fair deal considering the inflation."
