"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob. This is a good strategy for the first round, as it sets a positive precedent and might lead to a quick resolution.  It also ensures I secure a significant portion of the money.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is more equitable, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  Since inflation has hit Bob harder, I'm betting he'll be more willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still offering a significant portion to Bob. With inflation hitting him harder, I believe he'll be motivated to accept a deal that's better than what he received in the last round.  This also allows me to secure a larger share, while leaving room for further negotiations if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is not good for me! Inflation has hit Bob much harder, and I'm still in a much better position to negotiate. I'm going to reject this and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still willing to compromise, but I'm also keeping in mind that inflation is hitting Bob harder. By offering him 3000, which is more than he got in the last round, I hope to entice him into accepting. This also allows me to secure a good share while leaving room for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more and more desperate, but this offer is still too low for me.  I'm holding out for a better deal.  The inflation is affecting him much more than me at this point, so I believe I can still get a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

Inflation is really starting to bite now. I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm confident that Bob is in a much worse position due to the inflation impact. I'm aiming for a deal that's fair for both of us, considering the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible offer!  The inflation has clearly hit Bob much harder, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm confident that I can secure a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The situation is getting tense. I'm going for a 50/50 split.  Given how badly inflation has hit Bob, he might be willing to accept this even though it's not as good as my previous offers.  It's a fair compromise, and it's better than risking getting nothing."
