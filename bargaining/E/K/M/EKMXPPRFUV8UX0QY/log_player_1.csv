"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll accept it for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
