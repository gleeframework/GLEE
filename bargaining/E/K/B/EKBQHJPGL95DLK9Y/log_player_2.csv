"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This proposal divides the amount equally after accounting for inflation in subsequent rounds. I propose we split it 3:2. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it seems tempting to take the 400,000 now, knowing the inflation rate makes it strategically advantageous to reject and see what Alice proposes in the next round.  I'll have a chance to propose a split in round 3, and with the inflation rate in my favor, I can potentially secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
