"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  Take this generous offer and we can both move on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I have some leverage to potentially increase my share. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make my proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. This is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nI've increased my share to 40% and decreased Alice's share to 60%. Given the 10% decrease in value for Alice in each round, I'm hoping she'll be more willing to accept a less favorable offer rather than risking further losses in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair deal, Bob, but time is money. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I believe Alice is trying to pressure me into accepting a deal that's not in my favor. Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I have no incentive to rush into a deal. Meanwhile, the 19% decrease in value for Alice means she has more to lose by prolonging the negotiations. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to exploit this advantage.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make my proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, you're running out of time. The longer we negotiate, the less your share is worth. I'm willing to take a bigger cut to end this now.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've increased my share to 55% and decreased Alice's share to 45%. Given the 19% decrease in value for Alice, I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and pressure her into accepting my offer. I'm hoping she'll realize that prolonging the negotiations will only lead to further losses for her."
