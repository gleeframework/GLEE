Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're running out of time. The longer we negotiate, the less your share is worth. I'm willing to take a bigger cut to end this now. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Alice. Waiting any longer means a smaller and smaller share, even if she manages to secure a slightly better split in future rounds.
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob is clearly aware of the inflation working in his favor and is using it to his advantage. He's likely to offer increasingly less favorable splits knowing Alice is under time pressure.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting the current offer guarantees Alice $450,000 (though its present value is less due to the 27.1% inflation). Rejecting it means risking an even lower offer in the future with no guarantee of a better outcome. 

While $450,000 is significantly less than Alice's initial offer, the impact of inflation makes it a pragmatic choice over the uncertainty of further negotiation."
