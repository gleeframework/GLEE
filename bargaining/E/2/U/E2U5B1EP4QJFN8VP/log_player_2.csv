This is a tough one, but I need to accept.  Here's why:

* **Time pressure:** This is the 11th round out of 12. If I reject, I'm taking a huge gamble that Alice will offer me anything at all in the final round. She has no incentive to offer more than a tiny amount.
* **Diminishing returns:** While 30 is much lower than I was hoping for, waiting another round means the money will be worth even less. The difference between accepting 30 now and potentially getting a slightly better offer next round is negligible compared to the risk of getting nothing.

It's clear Alice was banking on my aversion to risk. While I would have preferred a better outcome, taking something is better than nothing in this late stage of the game."
