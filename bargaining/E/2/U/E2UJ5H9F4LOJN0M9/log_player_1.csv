"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000,
""message"": ""Let's make a deal. This offer is in your best interest considering the inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong opening:** Alice starts with a proposal heavily favoring her. This establishes a starting point for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Bob's self-interest:**  The message highlights the impact of inflation on Bob's potential earnings, incentivizing him to accept a smaller amount now rather than risk getting even less later.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** While heavily skewed, the offer isn't insulting. It allows Alice to appear somewhat flexible and open to negotiation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a significant sum. Consider the impact of inflation on my share if you decline. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable shift:** Bob's offer significantly reduces Alice's share while increasing his own, even considering the 5% inflation. This is a worse deal than Alice's initial offer.
* **Exploiting perceived pressure:** Bob's message tries to pressure Alice by emphasizing inflation's impact on *his* share, hoping she'll overlook the significant loss she'd incur by accepting. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting, Alice signals she won't be pressured into a bad deal. This keeps the negotiation open, and Bob is likely to propose a more balanced offer in the next round to avoid further devaluation of his potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Bob, this offer ensures a fair outcome for both of us considering the ongoing inflation. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Alice reduces her demand from 900,000 to 700,000, showing a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise.
* **Still Favors Alice:**  While a concession, the offer still heavily favors Alice, which is reasonable considering the inflation only affects Bob's share.
* **Appeals to Fairness and Mutual Benefit:** The message frames the offer as a win-win solution, emphasizing the fairness for both parties and highlighting the shared interest in avoiding further losses due to inflation. 
* **Urgency:** By stating ""Let's close the deal,"" Alice subtly increases the pressure on Bob to accept before his potential share diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want a larger share, but this back and forth is only hurting me due to the inflation.  Let's end this with a fair and equal split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acceptable Outcome:**  While not ideal, a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome for Alice. It's significantly better than Bob's previous offer and ensures she doesn't lose any value due to prolonged negotiations.
* **Shifting Power Dynamics:** Bob's message, particularly ""this back and forth is only hurting me,"" acknowledges the impact of inflation and implicitly concedes that his bargaining position is weakening. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to reject offers in hopes of securing a slightly larger share carries increasing risk. Bob's offers are trending towards a more even split, and there's a chance his next proposal might be less favorable than the current one."
