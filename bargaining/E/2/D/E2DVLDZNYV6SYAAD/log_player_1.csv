This is a tough situation, but it's better to accept than to risk getting a worse offer in a later round. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly for you with each round. Accepting $300,000 now is better than potentially getting a slightly better offer later when its real value has eroded further.
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob's message suggests this is his final offer.  He's likely betting that you'll cave under the pressure of inflation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in Round 7 is incredibly risky. There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better, and even a small increase won't offset the significant inflation you've endured. 

While not ideal, taking $300,000 now is a safer choice than the uncertainty of future rounds."
