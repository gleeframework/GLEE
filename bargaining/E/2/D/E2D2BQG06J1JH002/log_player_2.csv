"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects our positions in the game. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each passing round, I want to try to get more than 40% of the original amount. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation rate is higher for me. Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but your offer was too low. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's offer has improved, I still think I can negotiate a better deal. Considering the inflation rate, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get more than 45% of the original amount. The difference in inflation rates between us gives me some leverage to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still concerned about the inflation impact. Let's try to find a compromise that takes into account our different inflation rates.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise that slightly favors you considering the inflation difference. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm accepting this offer because, considering the inflation rates, getting 48% of the original amount now is a better deal than risking further rounds and potentially ending up with a lower value due to inflation. The difference in inflation rates has been factored into Alice's offer, making it a reasonable compromise. Proceeding further could lead to diminishing returns, so it's prudent to accept this offer and close the deal."
