"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 seems reasonable.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than 60-40. How about we try 70-30? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I don't think I like the 70-30 split. I'd rather not give up that much. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to account for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 70% of the pot. How about 42-58?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. How about 80-20? It's still a good deal for me, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'm getting a bit desperate. I'll consider it, but I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 19.26% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet. I think 55-45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up either. I think I can get a better deal. How about 90-10? It's my last offer, so think carefully. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating into my potential earnings!

I'm not thrilled about the 90-10 split, but I'm starting to feel like I'm in a tough spot. I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits of continuing to negotiate versus accepting this offer.

Round 7
