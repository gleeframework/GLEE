"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'm willing to be generous!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80 dollars and leave Bob with 20 dollars. I'm framing it as a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have the rest, let's finalize 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm effectively getting 40 dollars, which is still a significant amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
