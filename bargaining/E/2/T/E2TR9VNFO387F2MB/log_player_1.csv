"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'll let Bob know that I'm open to negotiations if he's not satisfied with this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to negotiate for more later! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20-80 split, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is trying to negotiate for more later, I'll respond with a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal if you meet me in the middle. How about 40-60?""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not satisfactory, I'll make a new proposal. This time, I'll aim for a more balanced split.

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair compromise. Let's see what you think!""}"
