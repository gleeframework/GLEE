"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45 in my favor this round.  I think we can both do better than the last offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting worse for me.  While he's right that both of us would get more than our previous round's offers, I need to hold out for a better deal to counteract the inflation working against me.  If I reject, I can propose something more in my favor next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 510000,
""bob_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a better offer than last round for both of us, considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Countering Inflation:** I need to push for a larger share in each round to compensate for the 10% devaluation of my potential gains.
* **Slight Advantage:**  This offer is still slightly advantageous to me, but it's better than Bob's previous offer even after accounting for inflation. 
* **Urgency:**  I'm implying urgency to Bob, hoping he'll see the value of a reasonable deal now rather than risking further losses for both of us due to inflation."
