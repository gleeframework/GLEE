"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I want to secure a large share early on, before inflation significantly impacts my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer guarantees me a gain, albeit a smaller one. The inflation would diminish my gains significantly in the next round if I reject this offer."
