"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the initial amount, and I'll take the remaining $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 85/15 is a more fair split, considering the inflation we both need to factor in. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the new proposal, I'll calculate the effective gains in real terms:

My gain: $150,000 (nominal) / 0.9 (10% inflation) = $166,667
Bob's gain: $850,000 (nominal) / 0.8 (20% inflation) = $1,062,500

With these numbers, I'm not convinced that the 85/15 split is fair, considering the significant difference in our effective gains. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise and take less, but I think 60/40 is a fairer split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the current nominal amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 70/30. It's still a good deal for both of us, especially considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gains in real terms:

My gain: $300,000 (nominal) / 0.727 (27.1% inflation) = $412,812
Bob's gain: $700,000 (nominal) / 0.5192 (48.8% inflation) = $1,349,419

Considering the significant difference in our effective gains, I'm not convinced that the 70/30 split is fair. I'll reject this offer.

}
```

I'm offering Bob $550,000, which is 55% of the current nominal amount, and I'll take the remaining $450,000."
