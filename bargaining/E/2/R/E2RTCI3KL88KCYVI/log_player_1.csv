"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to offer Bob a small share to start with, hoping to get the game over quickly.  Since the money inflates, I want to secure the majority as soon as possible.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While Bob is offering more than he did in the first round, it's still significantly less than what I would like.  I'm hoping that he'll realize he needs to offer more to get me to accept before the inflation gets too bad."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still keep a large majority.  I hope Bob realizes that I'm not going to settle for much less and he'll start to negotiate more seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  The inflation is starting to hurt now, but Bob's offer keeps getting worse. I'm hoping to hold out for more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still keep a large majority.  I hope Bob realizes that I'm not going to settle for much less and he'll start to negotiate more seriously."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Bob is getting greedy, and the inflation is really starting to hurt now, but I'm hoping to hold out for more. I think he'll realize he needs to offer me a bigger share to get me to accept before the inflation gets worse."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

The inflation is really hitting now, but I'm still trying to hold out for a larger share. I'm going to slightly increase my offer again, but it's getting risky. I think I need to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a significant portion of the money, but I can't offer too much or I'll be giving up too much to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is getting really bad!  It seems Bob isn't willing to negotiate fairly, and the inflation is hitting hard.  I need to keep holding out for a better offer.  Hopefully, he'll realize he needs to offer me a bigger share before the inflation eats up most of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt now, and Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of it. I'm going to offer an even split, hoping that Bob will realize he needs to be more reasonable to get any deal done. I'm not sure if he'll accept, but it's my best shot at getting something before the value of the money drops even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is ridiculously low!  The inflation is making the money worth so little now, but I'm not going to settle for being given crumbs.  I'm going to keep holding out for a better offer.  We only have a few rounds left, so hopefully, he'll start negotiating seriously before we both get nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

This is a risky move, but I have to try to get a deal done. The inflation is really hurting now, and I'm losing a significant amount of value with each round. This is close to my minimum, but I'm hoping Bob sees that we both need to compromise to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a ridiculous offer!  I'm not going to accept this, even though the money is worth very little now.  It's clear that Bob is just trying to take advantage of the situation and leave me with nothing.  It's better to get nothing than to be treated so unfairly.  I'm not going to let him win."
