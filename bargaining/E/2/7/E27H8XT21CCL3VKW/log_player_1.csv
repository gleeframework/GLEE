"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I'm hoping Bob will find acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $500,000 is worth only $450,000 in the previous round's terms, which is 45% of the original amount. I'm not sure what the inflation effect is on Bob's gain, but I'm willing to take the risk.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
