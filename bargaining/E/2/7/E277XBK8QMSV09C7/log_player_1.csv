"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor will work in my favor in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is more generous than my previous offer, I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
