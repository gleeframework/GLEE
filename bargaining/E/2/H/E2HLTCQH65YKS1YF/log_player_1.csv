"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll get $5,000, which is actually $6,000 in the first round.

Hmm... I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I was hoping to get a bit more.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll!

Let me calculate the equivalent value in the first round... If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,000, which is actually $5,500 in the first round.

Hmm... I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm getting a bit desperate. I don't want to risk going to the next round and getting an even worse deal.
