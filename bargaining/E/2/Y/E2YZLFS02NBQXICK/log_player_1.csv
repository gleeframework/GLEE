"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share for now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to start, hoping he'll think it's a fair offer and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $5000 I would gain is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4000.

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, but it's a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer.
