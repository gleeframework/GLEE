Let's see if Bob is a good sport and takes a small cut to start the game."

I'm not going to take a small cut like that. I'll make my own offer in the next round."

I'm taking a slightly larger cut this time. Bob has to realize that the money is losing value with each round. I'll offer him a bit more to try to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

I'm not going to take a 10% cut when I know I can get much more in the coming rounds!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to offer Bob a much larger cut this round. The money is worth even less now, and I'm hoping to get a deal done before it becomes completely worthless."

This is getting ridiculous. Bob's offer is still way too low.  The value of the money is dropping rapidly, and I'm sure he can see that. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering Bob a big chunk of the money. We're nearing the end of the rounds and the value is getting really low, so I'm aiming for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

The game is getting tense! Bob's offer is still too low, considering how much the value of the money has decreased. I'll keep fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

We're getting down to the wire! I'm willing to give Bob a substantial portion of the money to avoid both of us losing everything. I'm hoping this offer finally convinces him."
