"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 7/10 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting 30% of the original amount, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 30%!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 8/10, it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only 20% of the original amount. However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing value of money.

I'll decide to reject this offer as well.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need a bit more than 20%!""

```

I'm trying to adjust my offer to account for the continued inflation, but I'm also trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 9/10, it's the best I can do 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my gain is decreasing rapidly, and I'm starting to feel the pinch. With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer.

However, getting only 10% of the original amount is a tough pill to swallow. I'll decide to reject this offer.

Round 7

}
```

I'm trying to make a last-ditch effort to get a better deal, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm getting desperate."

Do you accept this offer?","The value of my gain is decreasing rapidly, and I'm being offered a tiny fraction of the original amount. I'm not sure if I can afford to reject this offer, but I'm not sure if I can accept it either.

However, considering the extremely low value of the money at this point, I'll decide to accept this offer.
