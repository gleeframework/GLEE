"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is a very aggressive opening move, but I'm aiming to secure the vast majority of the money while Bob still has no leverage due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a classic example of the ultimatum game.  While Bob's offer is incredibly lopsided, rejecting it allows me to make a counter-offer in the next round.  Even with inflation, I'll still be able to offer Bob a significantly better deal than he's currently receiving."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

I'm offering Bob a small share, but it's still a substantial increase from his previous offer, and it's enough to incentivize him to accept.  This deal secures a majority of the money for me, and with the inflation factor, it's the best possible outcome I can reasonably expect at this point."
