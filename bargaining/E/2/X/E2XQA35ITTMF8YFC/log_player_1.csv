"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more balanced split is more fair. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if 45% is a good enough share for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less again, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's see if this is more to your liking.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 54% of the remaining $800,000 (80% of the original $1,000,000, adjusted for inflation), leaving Bob with 46%."
