"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, considering I'm affected by inflation 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is close to a fair split, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Since each round reduces the value of the money for Alice, it's in my best interest to see if I can get a better deal by rejecting this offer and waiting for my turn to propose."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split the money more evenly. Since we both have to deal with inflation, I'm offering a slightly more balanced split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit less than before, but still need a larger share. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this offer is a slight improvement from the previous round, it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor. I can afford to be patient and wait for my turn to propose again, hoping that the increasing inflation will force Alice to make a more balanced offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm aware of the inflation and I'm trying to be fair.  This offer gives you a good share while still acknowledging the impact of inflation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meeting in the middle, hoping we can settle before inflation gets worse. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

This is a fair and balanced offer, especially considering the impact of inflation on Alice. Accepting this will ensure a good share for both of us."
