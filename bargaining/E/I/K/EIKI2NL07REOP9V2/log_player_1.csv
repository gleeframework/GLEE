"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement. I'm also aware that with each passing round, the money is worth less, so it's important to get a deal done quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, Bob's offer is still quite good considering the inflation.  Accepting now ensures I get at least some money, and the risk of losing more in the future rounds is too high."
