"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we both need to account for. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 55/45 split is fair, considering I was willing to give 40% in the first round. I'd like to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, 50/50 seems like a fair compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, trying to find a middle ground after Bob's previous offer."
