# Bob gain: 1000

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's a good start, but I think I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  I'm offering a good split that gives us both a decent amount.  Think about it carefully, as each round makes the money worth less for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can both do better than that Bob.  I'm offering you a fair share, but I need more to be satisfied.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still going to reject this offer. I know that inflation is hurting both of us, but I think we can still find a split that's more equitable. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're losing money with every passing round.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you a decent share, but let's not let this go any further.  This is a fair offer for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing value with each round.  This is getting ridiculous.  Let's split this evenly and avoid further losses.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  An even split is a fair compromise, and we're both losing money fast.  Let's accept this offer and avoid further losses."
