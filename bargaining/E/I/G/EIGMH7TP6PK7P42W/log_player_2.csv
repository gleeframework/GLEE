Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable, but you're pushing me.  This is my final offer - 45/55.  Any more of this back and forth and we both lose.

# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm getting nervous about the decreasing value. While I'd prefer a better deal, accepting this offer guarantees me a decent amount before the value drops too low."
