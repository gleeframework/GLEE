Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a sizable share to end this quickly.  Every round that passes hurts both of us, but you especially. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
