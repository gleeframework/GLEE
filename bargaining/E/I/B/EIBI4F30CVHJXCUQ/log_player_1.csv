Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe my contributions warrant a larger share. This offer still ensures a substantial amount for you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the money is worth 20% less, I believe I can negotiate for a larger share. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
