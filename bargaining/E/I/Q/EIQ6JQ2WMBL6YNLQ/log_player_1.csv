"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite cheeky!  Let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Consider that due to inflation, the longer this goes on, the less value the money holds for me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
