"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll get less, I'll get more, let's see what you do! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll reject this offer. The money I'd gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer doesn't take that into account. I'll wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking more, I'm taking less, but I'm still willing to compromise!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the 10% inflation that has already occurred, and I'm trying to find a balance that might be more appealing to Bob."
