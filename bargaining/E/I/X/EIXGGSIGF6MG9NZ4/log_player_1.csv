"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the lion's share, but it's a good starting point for negotiations.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more balanced split. I'm willing to give up some to avoid losing more due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable, but I'm still not satisfied with the split. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit more balanced, but I'd like to get a better deal. I'm willing to give up some, but I need a better share.""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and sending a message to Bob to keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 550,000, I'll try to counter with a slightly higher offer for myself, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount. I'll also try to make the offer more enticing by framing it as a ""generous"" offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being generous here, let's call it a 60/40 split. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see how Bob reacts this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This inflation is getting out of hand. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is getting desperate due to inflation, and I can sense that he's trying to avoid further losses. I'll take advantage of this and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting nervous, Bob! I'm not ready to split it evenly just yet. I'll give you a chance to sweeten the deal.""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer and sending a message to Bob to try to get a better deal. I'm hoping he'll try to offer me more to avoid further losses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 500,000, I'll try to counter with an even higher offer for myself, taking advantage of his growing desperation. I'll also try to make the offer more appealing by framing it as a ""generous"" offer, while still leaving Bob with a decent amount.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being very generous here, let's call it a 70/30 split. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation and the risks we're taking.""
}
```
