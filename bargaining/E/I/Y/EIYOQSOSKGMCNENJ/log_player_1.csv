Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the ongoing inflation and previous offers, this division seems fair and acknowledges the decreasing value for me over time. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to secure a larger share despite the inflation working against him.  While his offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's not in my best interest to accept yet. As the rounds progress, the inflation will continue to decrease the value of his share, making him more likely to accept a deal more favorable to me."
