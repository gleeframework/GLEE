Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a very small share of the money. I'm hoping that he'll accept it, as he has no idea about the inflation factor and might be happy with anything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a good deal for me, as I have no information about the inflation rate for Bob.  It's much better than the 0% I would get if we keep rejecting each other until the end."
