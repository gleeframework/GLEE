"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. Take 1000, I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. The message is a friendly introduction to the game, suggesting a fair share to get things started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, it's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $9,000 is now worth $7,200.

I don't think splitting it evenly is the fairest way, considering the initial offer I made was already a generous one. I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my $7,200 is now worth $5,760.

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the reduced value of my potential gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away with an even split that easily. Take 4k, I'll take 6k.""
}
```"
