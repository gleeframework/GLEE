Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll compromise, but let's be reasonable. I'm willing to go down to 700,000, but that's my final offer. We can't keep going like this. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting greedier! While her offer is better than her first, the rate of inflation is hurting us both. I need to signal I'm serious about getting a larger share, but I also need to be mindful that time is running out. We'll counter with a stronger offer in the next round."
