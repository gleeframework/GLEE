# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'd like to negotiate further to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's previous offer was 60-40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

I'll try to negotiate further to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's previous offers have been getting more and more extreme, I'll try to make an offer that's closer to a 50-50 split. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42
}

This offer is a bit more favorable to me, but still leaves Bob with a significant share. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's previous offers have been getting more and more extreme, I'll try to make an offer that's closer to a 50-50 split, but with a slight bias towards me. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 51,
  ""bob_gain"": 49
}

This offer is a bit more favorable to me, but still leaves Bob with a decent share. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
