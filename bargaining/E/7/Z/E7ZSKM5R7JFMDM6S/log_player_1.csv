"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. It's a pretty good deal, considering we have 11 more rounds to go!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* My gain: $6,000 (not $6,000, but $5,400, since it's 10% less than $6,000)
* Bob's gain: $4,000 (not $4,000, but $3,800, since it's 5% less than $4,000)

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd rather wait for a better offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll!

Let's calculate the actual amounts I'd get:

* My gain: $5,000 (not $5,000, but $3,625, since it's 27.1% less than $5,000)
* Bob's gain: $5,000 (not $5,000, but $4,275, since it's 14.26% less than $5,000)

Hmm, this is a tough one. I'm not sure if I should take it, but I don't want to risk going lower. I'll take it.
