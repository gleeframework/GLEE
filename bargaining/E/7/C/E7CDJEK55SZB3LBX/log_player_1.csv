"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that, let's see if you'll accept a more generous offer from me. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 30-70 split, especially considering the inflation is affecting my end. I'll wait for his next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, trying to balance my desire for a better share with the risk of Bob rejecting my offer again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I'm not going to give away the majority of the money. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the new offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. With the inflation affecting my end so severely, I'm not comfortable with a 20-80 split. I'll keep trying to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I'd like to get at least a bit more than 20 dollars to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 35-65 split, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
