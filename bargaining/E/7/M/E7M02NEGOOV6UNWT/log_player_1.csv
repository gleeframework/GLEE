"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
I'm offering to take $600,000 and leave $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
