"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive 600,000 dollars and Bob receives 400,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive 700,000 dollars and Bob receives 300,000 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! My gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease. Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully.

However, since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, it seems like he's getting a relatively better deal. But I still need to consider the current value of the money.

I'll accept this offer.
