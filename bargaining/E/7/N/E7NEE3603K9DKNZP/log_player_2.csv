"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Alice's offer is the same as in round 1, and the value of my potential gain is lower due to inflation. I'll accept this offer to get something rather than risking going to the next round where the value of the money will decrease even further.
