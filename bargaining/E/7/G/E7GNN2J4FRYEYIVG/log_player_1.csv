Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split. We both have time to work out a better deal if we're not happy with this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. This offer accounts for inflation and gives us both a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob claims his offer accounts for inflation, it's the same offer I made in Round 1, where my money was worth more. Accepting now would mean losing out due to the decreasing value of my share. I need to push for a better split to offset the inflation disadvantage."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the inflation is hurting you more than me. Let's compromise and avoid losing everything. This offer is fair considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using the inflation to his advantage, trying to pressure me into accepting a less favorable deal. While his offer is better than his previous one, it's still not enough to offset the significant impact of inflation on my share. I need to hold out for a better offer, even if it means risking getting nothing at all."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this inflation is getting serious.  We need to compromise to avoid losing it all.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 575000 
# Bob gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with time running out, I need to make a pragmatic choice. Bob has labeled this as his final offer, and while it's not ideal, it's better than his previous offer. 

Here's why I'm choosing to accept:

* **Time pressure:** We only have four rounds left, and if we don't reach an agreement, we both lose everything.  
* **Inflation impact:**  While this offer isn't perfect, waiting any longer will only diminish the value of my share further.
* **Bob's stance:** He's unlikely to offer anything significantly better, especially after labeling this his final offer.

It's a gamble, but accepting now guarantees a reasonable amount, whereas rejecting it risks a complete loss."
