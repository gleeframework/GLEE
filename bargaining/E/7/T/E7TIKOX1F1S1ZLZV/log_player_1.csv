# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I need to think carefully about whether this is a good deal.

After some thought, I've decided:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 40% of the total amount. I'll wait for the next round to make my own proposal."
