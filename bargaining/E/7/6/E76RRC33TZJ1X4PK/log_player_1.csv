"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fair split considering we both have to share the potential loss from inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I'm being more cautious.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think 55/45 is still a bit skewed towards Bob, considering the inflation effect on my end. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger toll on my end, I'll propose a more aggressive split to compensate:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm taking a bigger share this round. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm trying to make up for the lost value of the money by taking a larger share, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you 40% since the money is losing value.  I think we can reach an agreement this round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think 40% is still a bit low, considering the rapid decline in the money's value. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the accelerated inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the rapid inflation, I'll propose an even more aggressive split to try to make up for the lost value:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Considering the accelerated inflation, I'm taking a big risk by offering you 20% of the remaining value. Will you take it?""
}
```

I'm trying to grab as much value as possible before the money becomes almost worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With inflation accelerating, I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option to maximize what we both get.  Let's agree to this and stop losing money. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation spiraling out of control, I think it's time to reconsider my stance.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

A 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, considering the rapidly declining value of the money. I'd rather share the remaining value equally than risk losing more by trying to negotiate further."
