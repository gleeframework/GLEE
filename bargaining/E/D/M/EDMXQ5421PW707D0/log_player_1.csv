"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but you'll still get a decent share 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with a 70/30 split, especially with inflation eating into my share. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and the fact that I'm trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself to make up for the inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering a 40/60 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still leaves Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to make up for the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is significantly better than the previous one, and I'd like to try to get an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the ongoing inflation and my desire to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more to make up for the inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering a 48/52 split, which is a slight improvement from my previous offers. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a compromise, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating into my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Actually, I'll take it! A 50/50 split is a fair deal, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the future. The inflation is making it harder for me to afford to wait."
