"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my offer from Round 1 is now worth less, and Bob's offer is a better deal for me.

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
