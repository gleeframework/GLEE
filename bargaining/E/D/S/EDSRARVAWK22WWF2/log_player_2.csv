Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're both being stubborn.  Let's split this evenly and call it a day before the inflation eats away at everything. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, especially on Alice, I think splitting the money evenly at this point is the most reasonable and fair decision. Further rounds would only diminish the value of the money, likely resulting in both of us getting less value than if we settle now."
