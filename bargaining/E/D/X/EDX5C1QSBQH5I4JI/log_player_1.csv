"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original $100, which is $20. I'm taking the remaining 80%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer from Bob.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll compare the values in the same way. 

In the first round, I was offered $20, which is 20% of $100. In the second round, Bob is offering me $30, which is 30% of $100. This is an increase from 20% to 30%, which is a 50% increase. 

Considering the inflation effect on Bob, I'll reject this offer, as I'm not sure if I'm getting a fair deal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25
}
```

I'm offering Bob 25% of the original $100, which is $25. I'm taking the remaining 75%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer from Bob.

In the first round, Bob was offered $20, which is 20% of $100. In the fourth round, Bob is offering me $60, which is 60% of $100. This is a 200% increase from the first round, which is a significant jump.

However, considering the inflation effect on Bob, the $40 he's offering himself is worth only 48.8% of the original $20 he was offered in the first round. This means he's actually offering himself a smaller share of the original $100 than in the first round.

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise.
