"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering that the money will be worth 20% less in each subsequent round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of $8,000 in the first round is now worth $6,400 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I would be giving up $6,400 to get $4,000. This is a relatively good deal for me, considering the decreasing value of money.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
