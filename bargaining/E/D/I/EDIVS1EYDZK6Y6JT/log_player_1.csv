"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, Alice. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5000 is worth only 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $4000. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 5% less, but I'll assume it is.

Considering the offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept a 50-50 split. I was hoping for a bit more. However, I don't want to reject this offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. So, I'll accept this offer.
