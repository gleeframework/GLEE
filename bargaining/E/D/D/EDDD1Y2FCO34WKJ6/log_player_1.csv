"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective values are:

* My gain: $3,000 / 0.9 = $3,333.33
* Bob's gain: $7,000 / 0.8 = $8,750

Considering the decreased values, I'm not too thrilled about the offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll have to think carefully...

For now, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreased values due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll aim to get a bit more than in the previous round. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3300,
  ""bob_gain"": 6700,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 33-67 split, with me getting $3,300 and Bob getting $6,700. I hope Bob will be willing to compromise and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my original offer, but I'm still not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, the effective values are:

* My gain: $4,500 / 0.7279 ≈ $6,180.53
* Bob's gain: $5,500 / 0.5192 ≈ $10,609.15

Considering the decreased values, I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's getting closer to my previous offers. I'm not sure if I can do better, and Bob seems to be pushing me towards his original offer.

For now, I'll accept the offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
