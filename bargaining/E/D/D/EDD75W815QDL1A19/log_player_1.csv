"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take a bigger share, huh?

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather negotiate further to get a fairer share.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You took a bigger share last round, now it's my turn to take the lead!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but not as big as you're asking for! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Since my share is still lower than I'd like, I'll think about it...

I'll accept this offer. It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than going to the next round.
