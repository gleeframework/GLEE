I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer and it's likely Bob will become more aggressive with his proposals in the future. I'd rather take the guaranteed 50% now than risk getting less later."
