Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very aggressive offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round, as the money is worth the same for both of us right now. If he rejects it, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer a larger share, it's important to consider the inflation.  In the next round, I would have to make the offer, and Bob's money would be worth even less.  It's better to take a slightly less favorable deal now than risk getting a worse one later."
