I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  This is a generous first offer, considering the potential for inflation. I want to see if Bob is willing to settle quickly or if he wants to play it out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'm not thrilled to be getting only $100,000, it's better than nothing, especially considering the inflation.  It seems Bob is willing to play hardball, and it's not worth risking getting nothing at all to try and get a better deal later."
