"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get this over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation kicking in, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than the original $10,000, so I'm looking at a gain of $4,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept this offer to move on to the next round.
