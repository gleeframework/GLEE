"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
