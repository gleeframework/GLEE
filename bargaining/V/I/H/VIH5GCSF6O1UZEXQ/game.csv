90.0,10.0,Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can adjust in future rounds if needed.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
30.0,70.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit too lopsided. Let's be more realistic.  I'll take 70, you take 30. This accounts for the fact that the value decreases faster for me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
60.0,40.0,"Okay, let's try a middle ground.  I'll take 60 and you get 40.  This is still a significant gain for both of us, and it allows us to avoid further inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. I'm willing to meet you halfway - 60 for me, 40 for you.  This considers the faster devaluation for me.",Bob,4,
