"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This offer is a first step to see Bob's reaction. I want to take the majority, but I'm aware that the money will lose value over time and want to be careful not to push him too far."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the value of the money is decreasing with each round. This offer is fair and I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting it."
