"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10. I'll give you a fair chance to counter.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small share, in the hopes that he'll be motivated to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the numbers are now:

Alice gain: 200,000 x 0.8 = 160,000
Bob gain: 800,000 x 0.8 = 640,000

I'll reject this offer, as I'd like a larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough for me. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a more substantial share, but still leaves me with a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not sure it's fair 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 48.8% inflation, the numbers are now:

Alice gain: 400,000 x 0.5162 = 206,480
Bob gain: 600,000 x 0.5162 = 309,720

I'll reject this offer, as it's still not a good deal for me. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough for me. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Getting close to a deal. Meet me at 55-45.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but I'm still trying to get the better end of the deal."
