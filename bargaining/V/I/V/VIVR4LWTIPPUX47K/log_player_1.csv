"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $250,000. Your turn!""
}

I'm offering Bob $250,000, which is a relatively small portion of the total, hoping that he will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep some for myself. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up $400,000, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
