"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will agree to it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 70% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is very fair, considering the money is worth less in this round due to inflation. I'm not willing to give up 70% of the remaining money.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll propose a more conservative split. I'll offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""A bit more balanced split, considering the inflation""}

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share to make up for the inflation."
