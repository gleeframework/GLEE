"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going for a high initial offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a lopsided deal early on. If not, we'll see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much more favorable for him, but I'm still not ready to accept it. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a significant majority. I'm taking into account the inflation, but also that Bob is likely to be more willing to compromise now that he's seen my rejection of his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to get a very favorable deal for himself.  I'm not willing to accept this offer, even with the significant inflation. I think I can still negotiate a better deal for myself in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer further, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money. I'm taking into account the increasing inflation and trying to find a balance that might be more appealing to Bob.  He's clearly aiming for a much larger share, but I think we can reach a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still skewed heavily in his favor.  The inflation is making this game more difficult, but I'm determined to get a better deal.  I'm not giving up just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  The inflation is getting very significant, and I think it's time to compromise. Bob has been demanding a lot, and while I'd prefer a larger share, a fair split seems like the best option at this point.  We only have a few rounds left."
