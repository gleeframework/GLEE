"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80, you take 20.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me taking the majority of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in the second round, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5
Bob gain: 50

I'll have to think carefully about this offer... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me in the third round, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 47.5 * 0.95 = 45.125
Bob gain: 50 * 0.95 = 47.5

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority this time. Take 60, I'll take 40.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40:60 split, with Bob taking the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not too much. 40-60 split 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me in the fourth round, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 40 * 0.8574 = 34.296
Bob gain: 50 * 0.8574 = 42.87

But wait, Bob is offering a 40-60 split, which is the same as my previous offer! I think I can do better than that...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me in the fifth round, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 34.296 * 0.8574 = 29.4
Bob gain: 50 * 0.8574 = 42.87

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a lot, but I still need something. Take 70, I'll take 30.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30:70 split, with Bob taking the majority of the money."
