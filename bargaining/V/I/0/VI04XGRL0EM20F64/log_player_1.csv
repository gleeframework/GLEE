"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0
}
```

I'm taking the whole $100 for myself and offering Bob nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't want to give up 90% of the money, especially considering that the money I gain is still worth 100% of its original value. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a significant amount, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 80% of the money, especially considering that it's worth even less than it was in the first round due to inflation. I'll keep waiting for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 5:
