I propose a 90/10 split. It's a generous offer considering the potential for inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I reject Bob's offer. It's not fair, and I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I propose a 45/55 split. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to secure a significant portion of the money to offset the inflation.  Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
