Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, given that we both have an equal chance of being the proposer in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5700,
""bob_gain"": 4300,
""message"": ""I understand your point about fairness, but I need a bit more to agree. This is a slight improvement on my previous offer, considering the inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest option, and we can avoid further inflation losses. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 
 
Even though I could try for a slightly better split, the inflation is starting to eat into the potential gains. Accepting a 50/50 split now ensures a reasonable outcome and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
