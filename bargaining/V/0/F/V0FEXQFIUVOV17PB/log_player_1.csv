"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a somewhat aggressive offer, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm willing to take a bit of a risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the $10 and end the game, I know that I'm in a better position to negotiate in the next round. I'm confident that I can secure a larger share of the money, especially considering the inflation effect on Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly downwards to be more reasonable, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money. I'm aware of the inflation impacting Bob, and I want to find a balance between getting a good deal and ensuring the game doesn't drag on too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not the ideal outcome, the inflation effect on Bob has significantly reduced his bargaining power.  It's unlikely I can secure a better deal in the next round, and taking $20 is better than risking getting nothing at all."
