# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI don't think 10 dollars is a fair share, especially considering the inflation. I'll take my chances and propose a better offer in the next round. Let's proceed!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I think it's fair that I get a bigger share this time.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better deal. Let's try this, and see if we can agree on something in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not satisfied with Alice's offer. The inflation is taking a significant toll on my potential gain, and I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make another proposal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my gain is already worth 36% less.
