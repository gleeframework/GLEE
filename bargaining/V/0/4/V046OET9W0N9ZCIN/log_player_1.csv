I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate if you think it's too much. Let's see what you think!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500} 
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a 55/45 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to compromise, I don't want to give up too much.  Remember, inflation is working against Bob, so he has more pressure to come to an agreement."
