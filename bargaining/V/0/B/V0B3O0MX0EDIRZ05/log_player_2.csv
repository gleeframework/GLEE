Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money, but you get a decent starting point.  We can adjust as we go! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I'll try to negotiate for a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! I'll make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me."
