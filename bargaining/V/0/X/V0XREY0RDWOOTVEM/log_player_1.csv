"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself, which is a 9:1 ratio. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to negotiate further if he's not satisfied with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting too high, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the new values are:

Alice's gain: 50,000
Bob's gain: 902,500

I'm not thrilled about the 18:1 ratio, but I'm willing to compromise. I accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
