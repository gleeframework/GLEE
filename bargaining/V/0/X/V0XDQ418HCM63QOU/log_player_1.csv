I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping Bob will accept it.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The money I would gain is worth less due to inflation, and it's likely Bob won't budge from this 50/50 split in the next round."
