Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a more equitable split that reflects the value we both bring to the table.  Don't forget, the clock is ticking and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
