"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fair split, but I'm willing to go higher if you're willing to negotiate.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. 55/45.  Time is ticking, and we both lose if this keeps up. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm taking the offer, Alice is being stubborn, and I don't want to risk losing money due to inflation."
