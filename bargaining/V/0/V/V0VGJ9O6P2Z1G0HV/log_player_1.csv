"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 900,000 dollars for myself and giving Bob 100,000 dollars.  It's a fair starting point, and leaves plenty of room for negotiation.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

Since Bob rejected my offer and is now asking for more, I'm lowering my share slightly to 850,000, but increasing Bob's to 150,000 to demonstrate my willingness to compromise.  This should be a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a better deal, the inflation is hitting hard, and I'm now at a significant disadvantage compared to the first round. Accepting this offer at least ensures I get something, and it prevents the potential of getting nothing if I continue to reject."
