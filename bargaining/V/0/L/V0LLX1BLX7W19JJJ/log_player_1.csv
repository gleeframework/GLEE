"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This offer splits the money with a slight bias towards Alice, reflecting the greater impact of inflation on her share. I'm aiming for a quick agreement, while ensuring a reasonable outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial offer, even accounting for the inflation. I'm not willing to accept such a large reduction in my share, especially since I have a chance to counter-propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering an even split this time. This reflects the increasing pressure of inflation, making it more beneficial for both of us to agree now rather than risk further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still slightly less than my initial proposal, the increasing inflation makes it unwise to continue rejecting offers.  The potential for further losses outweighs the minor gain I could potentially achieve by continuing."
