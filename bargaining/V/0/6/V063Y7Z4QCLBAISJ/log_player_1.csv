"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100, which is $60, and leaving 40% for Bob, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'll take 80% 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with the 20% I'd get, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55-45!""
}
```

I'm offering a compromise, hoping Bob will accept this more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take 70% 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation! Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

30% is a bit too low for me, especially considering the significant loss in value due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, hoping to sway Bob's decision:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting desperate, but I'm getting serious. Meet me at 65-35!""
}
```

I'm pushing for a slightly higher share, but still leaving room for Bob to accept."
