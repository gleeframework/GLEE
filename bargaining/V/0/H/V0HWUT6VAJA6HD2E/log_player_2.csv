"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more as I'm making the first move. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the value of the money decreases by 20% each round, I'm hoping to get a better deal.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll take the bigger share since you didn't offer me a fair deal in the first round.""}\n\nSince the value of the money decreases by 20% each round, the total value is now $800,000. I'm hoping Alice will accept my offer before the value drops further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's getting pointless. Let's split it evenly and not lose any more money. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, I think it's best to accept Alice's offer and split the remaining amount evenly. Further rounds would only lead to more loss in value."
