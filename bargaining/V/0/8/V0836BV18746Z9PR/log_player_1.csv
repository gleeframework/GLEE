"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I think this is a fair offer, considering the risk of inflation and the potential for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it 50/50, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,000.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get, but it's a straightforward 50/50 split. I'll accept this offer.
