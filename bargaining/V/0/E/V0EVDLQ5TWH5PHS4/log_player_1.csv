"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""}

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better with a more even split.  Let's aim for something closer to 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only 40% of the total amount, even if it's a more even split. I'll keep negotiating to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made""}

I'm offering Bob $550,000, which is a slight increase from my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept."
