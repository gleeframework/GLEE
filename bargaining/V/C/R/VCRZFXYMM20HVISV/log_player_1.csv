"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a 30% share of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's work towards a win-win! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious with my decision.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a win-win, and I think Bob is trying to take advantage of the reduced value of money. I'd like to propose a new offer to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's see if we can find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $510,000, which is a slight increase from his previous offer, but still a relatively even split."
