Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is now reasonable enough to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing significantly with each round. This makes him more likely to accept a less favorable deal. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Delaying further means my potential gain isn't growing, even if it's not technically losing value like Bob's.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in the next round isn't worth the risk of Bob offering even less later or the deal falling apart altogether."
