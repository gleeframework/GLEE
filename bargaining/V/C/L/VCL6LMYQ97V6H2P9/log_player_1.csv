"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. I've included a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split, with me taking a bit more. This opening offer allows room for negotiation while also setting a baseline for further discussions. Given the impact of inflation, where the value of money decreases by 10% for me and 5% for Bob with each round, there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, Bob's response will dictate the next steps, and I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on his decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be generous, but let's be a bit more realistic. This offer is better for both of us in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer in this round. Although Bob suggests that his offer is more realistic and beneficial in the long run, accepting $45 (which, due to inflation, is worth less than the original amount) doesn't seem advantageous to me at this stage. Given that we're only in Round 2 and there are 10 more rounds to negotiate, I believe there's room for further compromise that could result in a more favorable outcome for me. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially leveraging the pressure of inflation to reach a more satisfactory agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to make an offer that slightly adjusts my initial proposal. By offering $58 for myself and $42 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of our gains. My message to Bob emphasizes the need to consider the devaluing money and the benefits of reaching an agreement sooner. This offer still favors me but shows a willingness to compromise, which might encourage Bob to accept or make a more favorable counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. This offer is fair and lets us both leave with something worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer in this round. Although Bob emphasizes the fairness of his proposal and the urgency of reaching an agreement, accepting $48 (which, due to inflation, is worth significantly less than the original amount) still doesn't seem advantageous to me. The fact that we're in Round 4 with 8 more rounds to negotiate suggests there's still room for maneuvering. Additionally, the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gains makes me cautious about accepting an offer that doesn't adequately compensate for this loss in value. By rejecting this offer, I aim to continue the negotiation, hoping to find a more favorable outcome or to prompt Bob into making a more substantial concession in the next rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting me hard, let's settle on this compromise""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to make an offer that reflects the increasing pressure of inflation on my potential gains. By proposing $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a compromise that acknowledges the devaluing money's asymmetrical impact on us. My message to Bob highlights the urgency from my perspective, emphasizing that each subsequent round significantly diminishes my share's value. This offer aims to strike a balance between securing a favorable outcome for myself and providing Bob with a substantial enough share to consider accepting, thereby ending the negotiation before the value of the money drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's time to be practical. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer in this round. Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, a 50/50 split at this stage seems reasonable. The money I gain is already worth nearly 41% less than in the first round, and each subsequent round will only further diminish its value. By accepting this offer, I secure a share that, although reduced by inflation, still represents a tangible gain. Continuing the negotiation risks further devaluation, potentially leading to a less favorable outcome or even the loss of the entire amount if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. Thus, accepting the 50/50 split appears to be the most practical decision under the current circumstances."
