"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money in a 4:1 ratio. I take 80$, and you take 20$. This way, we can ensure a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split of 60/40 in my favor. While the money is losing value, I believe this is a fairer division than 80/20. This gives you a larger share than you offered me and allows us to avoid further losses in the following rounds.""}
