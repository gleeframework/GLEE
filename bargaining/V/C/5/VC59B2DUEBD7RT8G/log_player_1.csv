"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the money in a 4:1 ratio. I take 80$, and you take 20$. This way, we can ensure a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more balanced split of 60/40 in my favor. While the money is losing value, I believe this is a fairer division than 80/20. This gives you a larger share than you offered me and allows us to avoid further losses in the following rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
