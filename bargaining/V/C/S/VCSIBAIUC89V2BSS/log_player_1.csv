I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure the deal quickly and avoid the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, a 50/50 split is a fair deal, and the risk of inflation in subsequent rounds is too high."
