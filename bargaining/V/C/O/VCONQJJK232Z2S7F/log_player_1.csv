"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be fair"". I believe this is a reasonable starting point, considering the decreasing value of money with each round. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to start with a slight advantage. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI reject this offer. Although the money is worth less now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm not willing to accept a split that's unfavorable to me, especially since Bob's message doesn't acknowledge the greater impact of inflation on my share.
{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of money, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer this time. I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, with the message ""Inflation is costly"". This offer takes into account the fact that the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the initial round. I'm trying to put pressure on Bob to accept a less favorable deal, while still leaving room for negotiation.
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Inflation is costly""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Inflation is hurting us both, so a fair split seems like the best option. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept this offer. Considering the significant decrease in the value of money for me (27.1% less than the initial round), I think an even split is a reasonable compromise. Bob's message acknowledges the impact of inflation on both of us, and I believe this offer is a fair way to end the game.
