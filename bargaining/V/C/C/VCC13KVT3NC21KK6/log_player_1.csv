I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. I figure Bob might be willing to accept a small amount just to avoid getting nothing at all in the end.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer. I'll take my chances and propose my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

Let's try a more even split this time. Hopefully, Bob will be more reasonable."
