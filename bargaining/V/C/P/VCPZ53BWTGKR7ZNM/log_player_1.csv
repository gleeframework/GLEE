"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose to take 9,000 dollars and give Bob 1,000 dollars.  Since the money loses value with each round, I want to secure a large share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, with the inflation and the potential to get nothing in the next round, it's better to accept this offer."
