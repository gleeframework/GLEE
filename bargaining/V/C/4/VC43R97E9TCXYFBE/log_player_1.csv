"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer is a bit biased towards Bob, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll factor that in. I'll accept the offer.
