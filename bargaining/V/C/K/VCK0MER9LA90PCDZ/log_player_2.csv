"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money as time goes on. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, your starting offer was a bit too skewed for my liking. Let's find a middle ground. This offer still gives you a larger share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer was more than fair considering the inflation working against me. This offer is a compromise, but we need to settle this soon. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiation in her favor, using the ""fairness"" argument while being aware of the impact of inflation on Bob. While the offer is slightly better, it's essential for Bob to hold a firm stance for a little longer to secure a more balanced outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 425000, ""alice_gain"": 575000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting dangerously close to losing a significant chunk of this money. My offer is a compromise, meeting closer to the middle ground while acknowledging the time pressure.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you need to be realistic about the declining value of this money.  This offer is a compromise, let's not throw away a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is mounting, but Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation.  While Bob is losing money due to inflation, accepting a deal heavily skewed in Alice's favor sets a dangerous precedent. Rejecting demonstrates Bob's commitment to a more balanced outcome and forces Alice to reconsider her approach. There's still time for a better deal, even if it means getting closer to the deadline."

It reflects the urgency while still offering a reasonable split. Let's end this before we both lose out.""}"
