"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it also leaves Bob with a small amount, which might encourage him to accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is better than his previous offer, but I am still better off waiting to propose in the next round.  The inflation will hurt Bob's offer more than it will hurt mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

This offer is a compromise,  giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still leaving me with a larger portion. Inflation will make this offer less appealing to Bob, and he may be more likely to accept it before it gets even worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is less appealing than my previous offer due to inflation, but the potential for more rounds of inflation means this might be the best I can get.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome."
