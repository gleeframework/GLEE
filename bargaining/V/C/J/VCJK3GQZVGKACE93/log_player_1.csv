I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since I'm the first to propose, I want to maximize my gain.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even though the money is worth less for me now, this is still a better deal than if I reject and then Bob gets to propose in the next round."
