"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further if you want to accept""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. This way, we both get a good share, and we can avoid further rounds and potential losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than 45% of the remaining amount, considering the decreasing value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you think it's not fair""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
