"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer considering the impact of inflation on both players.
Given that with each passing round, the money is worth 5% less for Alice (me) and 10% less for Bob, it's strategic to try and end the game as early as possible to maximize the value of the money for both parties.

### Step 2: Calculate the effective loss due to inflation for both players in the first round.
For Alice, the money is worth 5% less in each subsequent round, but since we're in the first round, this doesn't affect the initial offer directly. For Bob, the money is worth 10% less in each subsequent round, which gives me some leverage in negotiations since Bob has more to lose from delaying.

### Step 3: Formulate an initial offer that is likely to be accepted by Bob, taking into account the future loss of value.
Given the conditions, an offer that slightly favors Bob but still accounts for the decreasing value over time might be more likely to be accepted. A 60-40 split in favor of Bob could be seen as generous but also considers the future loss of value for both parties.

### Step 4: Attach a persuasive message to the offer.
The message should emphasize the mutual benefit of accepting the offer early to avoid further loss of value due to inflation.

### Step 5: Encode the offer and message in the specified JSON format.
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Accept now and we both lose less to inflation!""
}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{40}$"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer is fair given the inflation. If you reject, the money will be worth less for both of us in the next round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the impact of inflation on the current offer.
In the second round, the money is worth 5% less for me (Alice) and 10% less for Bob. This means that the actual value of the money offered is less than its nominal value.

### Step 2: Calculate the effective value of the offer considering inflation.
For me, the offer of $35 is actually worth 5% less than in the first round, which doesn't directly apply since we're calculating from the original $100. For Bob, his $65 is worth 10% less than in the first round, which is a significant drop.

### Step 3: Assess the fairness of Bob's offer given the circumstances.
Bob's offer of 35-65 in his favor does not seem to adequately account for the fact that the money is worth significantly less to him in this round. Given the decreasing value, the offer doesn't seem as fair as he claims.

### Step 4: Consider the potential benefits of rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer in the next round.
Rejecting the offer and moving to the next round means the money will be worth even less, but it also gives me the opportunity to propose a division that might be more favorable considering the inflationary pressure on Bob.

### Step 5: Decide whether to accept or reject Bob's offer based on the analysis.
Given the unfairness of the offer and the potential for a better deal in the next round, it seems prudent to reject Bob's offer.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Recalculate the value of the money for both players in the third round.
Given the inflation, for Alice (me), the money is now worth 10% less than its original value (5% decrease from round 1 to round 2 and another 5% decrease from round 2 to round 3), and for Bob, it's worth 20% less than its original value (10% decrease from round 1 to round 2 and another 10% decrease from round 2 to round 3).

### Step 2: Formulate a new offer that takes into account the decreased value for both players.
Considering the significant decrease in value, especially for Bob, a new offer should aim to find a balance that encourages Bob to accept while still being favorable to me. A 50-50 split of the current value might seem fair, but given the original $100 context, this needs to be adjusted to reflect the actual decreased value.

### Step 3: Calculate the adjusted offer values.
Given the decrease, if we were to split the perceived value evenly, we'd have to adjust the amounts to reflect the original $100 context. However, since the task doesn't explicitly require recalculating the exact value after inflation for the offer but rather to make an offer based on the $100, we focus on making an offer that is likely to be accepted given the conditions.

### Step 4: Create a persuasive message to accompany the offer.
The message should highlight the significant loss in value for both parties if the game continues and emphasize the fairness of the current offer given the circumstances.

### Step 5: Encode the offer and message in the specified JSON format.
Considering the simplification for this game's context and focusing on making an offer that accounts for the decreased value without explicitly recalculating it:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Given the significant loss in value, let's split it fairly now and avoid further inflation losses.""
}
```

The final answer is: $\boxed{55}$"
