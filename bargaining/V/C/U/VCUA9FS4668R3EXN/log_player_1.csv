"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $2000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $1900. Bob's gain of $8000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $6400.

I'll reject this offer. The ratio is too skewed towards Bob.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000}

I'm offering a slightly higher amount to Bob in this round, hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let me calculate the actual values considering the inflation.

My gain of $4000 is worth 95% of its original value (since 100% - 14.26% = 85.74%) which is $3400.
Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 51.2% of its original value (since 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%) which is $5120.

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's a decent compromise given the circumstances.
