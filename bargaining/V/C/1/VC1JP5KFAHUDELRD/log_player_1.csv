"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering to give Bob $30, and I'll take $70 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is still worth the same, but Bob's gain of $50 is worth 20% less than my initial offer of $30.

I'll accept this offer.
