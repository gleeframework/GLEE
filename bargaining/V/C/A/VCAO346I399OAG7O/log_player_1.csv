Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Okay, Bob, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think we should split it more evenly. How about this?""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. You're losing value every round. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split, it's clear that Bob is not willing to budge and my losses from inflation are increasing. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting an even worse deal in the next round."
