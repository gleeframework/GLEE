"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. The money is worth 5% less now, so I'll have to adjust my strategy.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I don't want to give up 40% of the remaining money, even if it's worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 10% less now, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a slightly smaller share, but I'm trying to get a better deal before the money becomes even less valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his previous offer, but the money is worth even less now due to inflation.

After considering the offer, I decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still don't want to give up 45% of the remaining money, even if it's worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 19.52% less than the original amount, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50-50 split, but I'm hoping he'll accept this deal before the money becomes even less valuable."
