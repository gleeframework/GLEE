"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 30 dollars and keep 70 for myself.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount, but not so small that he'll reject it outright, and I'm keeping a significant portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still a bit less than 70. Consider this a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I think 60 is a bit more reasonable than 40, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 56,
  ""bob_gain"": 44,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll give you a 50/50 split, no more negotiations needed. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth significantly less, and I'm starting to feel the pinch. Considering Bob's offer, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, especially since we've been negotiating for a few rounds.

I'll accept this offer and call it a day.
