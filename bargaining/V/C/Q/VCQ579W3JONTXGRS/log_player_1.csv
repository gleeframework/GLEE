I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation."

Bob is being quite greedy, and although the inflation is starting to hurt, I can still do much better. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm lowering my demand slightly, but still aiming for a significant share. I'm hoping Bob will realize that continued rejection will lead to a worse deal for him due to inflation."

# Bob gain: 550000

Bob's offer is still too low, and the inflation is starting to bite. However, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."

I'm willing to give a bit more to Bob, but I'm still aiming for the majority share.  The inflation is a significant factor now, and I need to close a deal before it gets worse for both of us."

The inflation is hurting both of us now, and Bob's offer is getting more reasonable. It's a good compromise for both of us, especially considering the money will be worth less in the next round. I'll accept."
