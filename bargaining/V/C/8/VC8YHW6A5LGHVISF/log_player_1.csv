"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll take a slightly bigger share this round 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less this round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $3,000 / 0.8 = $3,750 (due to inflation)
* Bob gain: $7,000 / 0.8 = $8,750

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, the total amount we're dividing is now equivalent to $8,000 (10,000 / 1.2^2).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not budging!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering to take 45% of the reduced total, which is $3,600 in real terms, and leaving $4,400 for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to move forward!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's split it 50/50 this time 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

* Alice gain: $5,000 / 0.5168 (1 - 0.4832) = $9,683 (approximately)
* Bob gain: $5,000 / 0.5168 (1 - 0.4832) = $9,683 (approximately)

Wow, Bob is really trying to meet me in the middle! I think this is a great opportunity to get a fair share of the money. I accept this offer.
