4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, let's be fair. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit. This is my final offer.",Bob,2,
,,"Bob, I understand that a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface. However, I proposed a reasonable division in the first round, considering the impact of inflation on my share. I'm willing to negotiate further, but your offer doesn't reflect the changing value of the money for me.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal, but your last offer didn't account for the decreasing value of the money for me. How about we switch the amounts from your previous offer? This way, we both feel the impact of the changing value over time.",Alice,3,
