"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $45, which is a bit less than half, considering that with each round, the value of money decreases more for me than for Bob. This division seems fair given the conditions of the game. Let's see if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both lose money each round, so let's maximize what we can get. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nWhile Bob's offer to split the money evenly might seem fair at first glance, it doesn't account for the disproportionate impact of inflation on my share. Given that my portion devalues faster, accepting this offer would put me at a disadvantage over time. I'll reject this offer and propose a new division in the next round that better reflects the game's conditions."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair.""}\n\nGiven the progressive devaluation of my share, I'll adjust my offer to ensure it remains equitable. By proposing that I receive $58, I'm accounting for the increased loss in value I incur with each round, while still offering Bob a substantial share. Hopefully, Bob will recognize the fairness in this adjusted division and accept."
