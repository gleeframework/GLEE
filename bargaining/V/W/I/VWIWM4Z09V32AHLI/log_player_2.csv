Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more acutely than Bob. While her offers are becoming ""better"" for Bob, she's still aiming for a larger share.  Bob needs to hold his ground a little longer to see if he can secure a more favorable outcome as the rounds progress and the pressure on Alice increases."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially given the rapidly declining value.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time for Bob to play a strong hand. Offering a 50/50 split is positioned as ""fair"" and emphasizes the shrinking pot.  This puts pressure on Alice: 

* **Accepting:**  A reasonable outcome, especially as time is running out.
* **Rejecting:**  Risks getting even less in future rounds, appearing greedy, and potentially getting nothing if no agreement is reached."
