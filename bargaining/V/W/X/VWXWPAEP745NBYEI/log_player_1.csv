"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the adjusted amounts. 

In this round, I would get $40, which is worth 90% of $44.44 (40% of $100 after inflation). 

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
