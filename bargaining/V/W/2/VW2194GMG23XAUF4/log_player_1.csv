"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000, and I'll take the remaining $750,000. This way, I'm giving Bob a decent share, but keeping the majority for myself. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself to account for the decreasing value of the money. Your turn, Bob!"

# Bob gain: 450000

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000
}
```

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
