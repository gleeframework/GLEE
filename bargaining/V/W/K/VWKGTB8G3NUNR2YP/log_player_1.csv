"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I propose to keep 99% of the money and give Bob 1% since the money is worth less for me in the next round. This seems like a fair way to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something. The inflation rate will make the money I receive in the next round much lower, making this offer the most beneficial."
