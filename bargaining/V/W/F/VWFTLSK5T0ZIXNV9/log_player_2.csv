"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  Bob needs to hold out for a much better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. This is a much fairer split, and we both know time is money.  Let's wrap this up.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground, Bob.  This is a more balanced split, and we can both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not good enough considering the faster rate of inflation impacting her gains. Bob can afford to be a bit more patient and push for a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and we both lose if this drags on. This offer is more than fair considering the inflation. Let's get this done.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. This offer is a compromise that gives us both a decent share, but we need to move quickly before we lose too much to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a good time for Bob to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for Alice. By round 5, she's feeling the pressure significantly more than Bob.
* **Shift in Proposal:** Alice has moved closer to a more balanced split, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly higher amount isn't worth the risk of getting nothing if the rounds run out.  

While Bob could try for a slightly better deal, accepting this offer guarantees him a reasonable share before inflation erodes the value further."
