"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000 for me and 100,000 for Bob.  It's a good starting point, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in future rounds if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept. Although I get less than I initially wanted, the inflation makes it clear that further rounds are unlikely to yield a better result."
