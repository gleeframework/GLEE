"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, trying to persuade Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of $500,000 is actually equivalent to $400,000 in the first round. This is a good offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, which is equivalent to $300,000 in the first round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close to the middle, but I'll take a bit more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. The message is a gentle push to see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I'll take a bit more too! 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less now, my gain of $525,000 is actually equivalent to $2,118,519 in the first round. This is a very good offer, and I'm starting to get a bit desperate to get a deal done. I'll accept this offer.
