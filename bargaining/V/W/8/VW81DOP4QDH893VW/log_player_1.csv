Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to settle this quickly. This offer is fair and avoids further losses to inflation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5250 
# Bob gain: 4750

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical course of action at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The continuous devaluation of the money heavily impacts both parties. Each round significantly diminishes the overall value.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Waiting for a better offer in later rounds might seem tempting, but the returns will be minimal compared to the losses incurred from inflation.
* **Bob's Position:**  Bob is likely aware of the decreasing value and is unlikely to offer significantly more in subsequent rounds. He's pushing for a settlement now for good reason.

Accepting the current offer cuts losses and ensures Alice receives a reasonable amount, even if it's less than initially hoped."
