"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I think I'm being taken advantage of. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account that the money is still worth 20% less for Bob compared to the first round.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}

This time, I'm offering a slightly skewed split, giving me a bit more than 50% of the total."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share!

Considering that Bob's gain is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and my gain is still worth the same, I think I should take this offer. It's a good opportunity to lock in a decent amount of money.
