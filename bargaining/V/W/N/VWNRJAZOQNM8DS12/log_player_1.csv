"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, giving me a slightly larger share. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 55 is worth 5% less than my initial offer of 60, which is equivalent to 57.5. I'm not sure if Bob's gain of 45 is better than his initial offer of 40, considering the inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems reasonable given the decreasing value of money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, my gain of 48 is worth 14.26% less than my initial offer of 60, which is equivalent to 51.55. Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good opportunity to get a slightly better share, so I'll accept this offer.
