Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a high initial offer, aiming to secure a large portion of the money while leaving room for negotiation.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm losing money with every round,  I'm still aiming for a larger share, and I believe I can get it if I continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, aiming for a more balanced split.  Since Bob didn't budge much, I'm hoping he'll be more agreeable this time."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the pressure of inflation is mounting, I'm still confident in my ability to get a better deal. Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable, and I believe I can secure a more equitable split if I continue negotiating."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm adjusting my strategy.  While I'm still aiming for a larger share, I'm also trying to find a compromise point.  This offer is a significant decrease from my previous one, but it's still within my desired range and I'm hoping Bob will find it more appealing."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair, and the inflation is making it even worse for me.  I'm still determined to negotiate a better deal, even though the time is running out."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm making a final stand. This offer is a significant compromise on my end, but I'm hoping Bob recognizes the dwindling time and the potential of losing everything. This is my last attempt to secure a reasonable share."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse, and the inflation is drastically reducing the value of my share.  Even though we're close to the end, I still can't accept such an unfair deal. I'm holding out for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

With only a few rounds left, I'm willing to accept an even split to avoid getting nothing.  I'm hoping Bob recognizes the urgency and the potential for a complete loss if we don't agree."
