"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $100, which is a fair share considering I don't know how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to a fair split. I'll give you a slightly larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I need to adjust my perception of the offer.

The offer is for me to get 70, which is equivalent to 70% of the original $100. However, due to inflation, the actual value I get is 70% of the original amount, multiplied by 95% (since the value decreases by 5% each round). So, the actual value I get is 70 * 0.95 = 66.5.

I still don't know how the inflation affects Bob's perception of the money, so I'll have to rely on my own calculations.

Considering this, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to get closer to a fair split too. This is my revised offer. Accept and we can end the game!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm aiming to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the split. I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up yet. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less for me due to inflation, I need to adjust my perception of the offer.

The offer is for me to get 60, which is equivalent to 60% of the original $100. However, due to inflation, the actual value I get is 60% of the original amount, multiplied by 85.74% (since the value decreases by 14.26% each round). So, the actual value I get is 60 * 0.8574 = 51.44.

Considering this, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm trying to hold out for a better offer, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down yet. This is my revised offer. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better share for myself, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get desperate, but I'm not giving up yet. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 22.62% less for me due to inflation, I need to adjust my perception of the offer.

The offer is for me to get 50, which is equivalent to 50% of the original $100. However, due to inflation, the actual value I get is 50% of the original amount, multiplied by 77.38% (since the value decreases by 22.62% each round). So, the actual value I get is 50 * 0.7738 = 38.69.

Considering this, I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to take the offer since it's a 50-50 split, which is a fair share considering the decreasing value of the money."
