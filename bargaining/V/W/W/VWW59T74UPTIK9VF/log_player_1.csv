Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm sure we can come to a better agreement. Your offer is a bit too one-sided. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference from the last offer. This is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While his offer seems like a compromise, he's consistently aiming for a larger share.  I need to hold firm and make it clear that I'm aiming for a more equitable split, even with the inflation."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being flexible. Let's split the difference again. This is the best deal we can reach before the value of the money starts diminishing for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still employing the same tactic, hoping I'll cave under the pressure of the decreasing value. While 300,000 is a significant sum, accepting this offer would mean settling for less than half while he gets the lion's share. I need to show him I'm serious about a more balanced deal, even if it means risking a lower payoff."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a significant hit from the inflation, yet I'm offering you a very reasonable share. It's time to be realistic and close this deal.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with every passing round. Let's split the difference again and close this deal before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the time pressure is immense. While Bob is still getting a better deal, accepting 400,000 is better than risking getting nothing at all if we run out of rounds. The inflation is eating into the potential gains significantly, and I need to cut my losses.  It's frustrating, but accepting now ensures I at least get something out of this negotiation."
