  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, and suggesting a 60-40 split as a fair starting point."

Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update.

I'm not sure I'm ready to give up that much more to Bob. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
