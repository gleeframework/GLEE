Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is presenting this as a compromise, time is working against Bob.  He needs to incentivize Alice to accept a deal soon or the value of the money will continue to plummet."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing money by being stubborn. Let's just split it down the middle and call it a day.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

A 50/50 split is the fairest offer, and by now Alice should recognize that dragging this out only hurts both of them. Bob needs to communicate the urgency of the situation clearly."
