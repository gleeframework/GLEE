Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty standard split, giving myself the majority.  Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'm going to try to get as much as I can right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more than $50, considering the inflation and that I don't know how it affects Bob, accepting this offer seems like the best strategy to ensure I get something.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round."
