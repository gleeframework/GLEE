"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%. It's a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a 40% share, but I need a larger share to make this worth my while. Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too skewed in his favor. I'd rather wait for a better proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60% is a fairer share for me. I'm willing to give you 40% this round.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better share for myself, considering the inflation is still affecting the value of the money."
