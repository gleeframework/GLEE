"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me $80 and Bob $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going for 80% 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth $36.

I'm not too thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's better than going to the next round and risking even lower gains due to further inflation.
