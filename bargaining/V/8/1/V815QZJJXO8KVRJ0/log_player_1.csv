"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth less, so I'd better accept a slightly better offer while I still can.
