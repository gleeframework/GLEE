"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a pretty good deal considering the time pressure."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair and simple solution 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair and simple solution, indeed!

I'll take it. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'll take the $5000 and call it a day!"
