{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going for a very high initial offer, aiming to secure almost all of the money. Since we don't know how inflation affects Bob, it's worth trying to get the best possible deal in the first round."

Even though Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous offer, I'm going to reject it. We're only in round 2, and I still have 10 rounds to try and get a better deal.  Since I don't know how inflation is affecting Bob, I'm going to hold out for more."
