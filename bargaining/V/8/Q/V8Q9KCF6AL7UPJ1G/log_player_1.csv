"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so the effective amount I would get in this round is 0.9 * 900000 = 810000.

Bob's offer is to split it evenly, so I would get 500000, which is less than the 810000 I would get if I accepted my original offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, the effective amount I would get in this round is 0.9 * 810000 = 729000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share this time, but I need to secure a good amount for myself. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is worth 0.271 * 900000 = 243900.

Bob's offer is to give me 400000, which is more than the 243900 I would get if I accepted my original offer, but less than the 729000 I would get if I accepted my offer in round 3.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
