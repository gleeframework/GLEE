400000.0,600000.0,"I think it's more fair if I get the bigger share this round.  Don't forget the money loses value with each round, so 400,000 now is better than nothing later.",Bob,2,

500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, and every round that passes hurts both of us. ",Bob,4,

550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, it's clear you're playing a tough game, but this is hurting both of us.  I'm offering a 45/55 split. It's better for me to get this over with than risk losing even more to inflation.",Bob,6,
