"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$ and keeping 80% for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. I think a 50/50 split is the best way to go. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of 50$ is actually equivalent to 55$ in the first round. However, considering the inflation, it's a good deal for me.

I accept the offer.
