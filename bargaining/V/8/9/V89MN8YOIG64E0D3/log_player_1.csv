Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000. I'm aiming for a large portion in the first round, hoping he accepts to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than I initially wanted, the inflation means my potential gains in future rounds are even lower. This ensures I at least get something, and avoids the risk of getting nothing if we continue to reject each other's offers."
