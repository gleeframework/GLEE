Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each round.  Let's split the money evenly and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Rapid Devaluation:** The value of Alice's share is decreasing rapidly. Accepting $500,000 now is better than risking getting a smaller amount later or even nothing if the rounds run out.
* **Unlikely Improvement:** Bob has consistently rejected offers where Alice receives a significantly larger share. It's unlikely he will agree to a deal where Alice gets significantly more than 50% at this stage.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only six rounds left, the pressure is on to reach an agreement. Holding out for a better deal is becoming increasingly risky. 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal considering the inflation disadvantage, it's the most pragmatic choice at this juncture to avoid walking away with nothing.
