"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 5500/4500 split.  I think this is a fair starting point given the decreasing value of the money with each round.  Let's see if we can agree on a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
