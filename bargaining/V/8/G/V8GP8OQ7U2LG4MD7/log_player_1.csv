I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a good chunk of the money.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept that offer. Let's see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still offering a fair split.  Hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept before we lose even more money to inflation."
