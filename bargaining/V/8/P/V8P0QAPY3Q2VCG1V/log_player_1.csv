"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This is a pretty standard 70-30 split, which I think is fair. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50-50 split! That's a bold move from Bob.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual amount is now $9,000.

Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This is a slightly better split for me, but still a fair offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
