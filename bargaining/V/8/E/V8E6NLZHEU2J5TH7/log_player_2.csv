Let's see what Alice offers in the next round after feeling the pressure of inflation!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think it's more fair that I get a slightly larger share, given the potential for inflation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either! 
# Bob gain: 580000 
# Alice gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the deal now and get more than 50% than risk further inflation and end up with even less!"
