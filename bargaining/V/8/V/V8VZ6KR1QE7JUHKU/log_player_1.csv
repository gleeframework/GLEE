Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's be realistic Alice, I'm losing money every round we wait. This is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm losing money fast, let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is experiencing inflation, I am not.  This means my bargaining position is relatively stronger with each round. However, Bob offering a 50/50 split is a decent outcome. It's better to take this guaranteed split than to risk Bob offering me even less in future rounds as his potential gains continue to shrink."
