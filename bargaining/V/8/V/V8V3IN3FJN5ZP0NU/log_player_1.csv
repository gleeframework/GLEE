"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and it's a good way to test the waters."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a bit more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 10% decrease in value, but I'll have to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split, and I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting taken advantage of!""}

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and protecting my own interests. This offer is slightly more favorable to me, but still gives Bob a decent chunk of the pie. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too soft on me, I'm worth more than that! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really biting hard now!

I'm not thrilled about the 27.1% decrease in value, and Bob's offer is even more aggressive this time around. I'm not comfortable with the 70/30 split, and I think I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer again. I'm not going to give in to his demands just yet.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 375000, ""bob_gain"": 625000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not getting taken advantage of! You're getting a good deal, but I'm not giving away the farm!""}

I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and protecting my own interests. This offer is slightly more favorable to Bob, but I'm still trying to hold my ground. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
