"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. This is a generous offer, considering the inflation will affect me more than Bob in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I think I deserve a bit more for the risk of not getting the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, the effective amounts are:
Alice gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36
Bob gain: 60 * 0.95 = 57

I'm not too thrilled about the 57% for myself, but I don't want to risk going into another round. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
