Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is significant, I believe I can still secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Bob's offer is still too low considering the current value of the money.  I'm hoping to reach a 50/50 split as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With the game rapidly approaching its end, the inflation risk is high.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to avoid the risk of getting nothing and maximize our chances of getting a decent share of the remaining money."
