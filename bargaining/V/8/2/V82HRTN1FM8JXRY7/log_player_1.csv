"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll take 60% and you can have 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep most of the money for myself 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll think about Bob's offer for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 45-55 split, and I'm hoping to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, aiming for a 55-45 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'll make a slightly better offer to keep the game going 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential gains!

I'll think about Bob's offer for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I'll take this offer. The 52-48 split is a bit better than my previous offer, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. Plus, I don't want to risk going into another round with even less purchasing power due to inflation."
