Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000.  Since the money is worth less to him each round, I figure this is a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm proposing to take $8000 and give Bob $2000.  Since he rejected my previous offer, I'm lowering my own share to try and reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more,  this offer is significantly better than what Bob offered before and his money is worth much less now. It's time to take what I can get."
