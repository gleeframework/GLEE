I'm going to propose a pretty generous deal for Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation that's already happened.  It's better to take the money now than risk getting a worse deal later on."
