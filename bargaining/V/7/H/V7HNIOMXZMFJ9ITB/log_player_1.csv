"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I'm still willing to be generous! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm still getting 40 dollars, which is 40% of the original 100 dollars. That's a good chunk!

However, Bob is getting 60 dollars, which is 60% of the original 100 dollars. That's a pretty big advantage for Bob, considering I'm only getting 40%.

I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more to Bob. I'll reject his offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a fair share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share this time, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit greedy, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is starting to hurt! Bob's offer is even more skewed towards him now, and the money he gains is worth even less due to inflation.

However, I'm still getting 30 dollars, which is 30% of the original 100 dollars. That's not bad, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more to Bob.

I'll think carefully about it... Ah, I'll reject this offer too.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit worried about inflation, but I'm still willing to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, I need most of the cash! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer now! The money he gains is worth a significant amount less than in the first round.

However, I'm still getting 20 dollars, which is 20% of the original 100 dollars. It's not a bad deal, but I'm starting to feel like I'm getting squeezed.

I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more to Bob, especially since he's not budging. I'll think carefully about it... Ah, I'll reject this offer.

```

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, considering Bob's previous offers have been quite skewed towards him. I'm hoping he'll be willing to meet me halfway."
