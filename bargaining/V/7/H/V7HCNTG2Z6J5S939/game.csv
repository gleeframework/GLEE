,,"That's a big jump from your previous stance, Bob.  Let's find a middle ground. We're losing money with each round.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,How about a 55/45 split?  It's closer to the middle and we both lose less to inflation.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to 55/45. We're losing money with each round, so we need to compromise.",Bob,4,
,,"This is getting ridiculous, Bob. You're just repeating my previous offer after rejecting it.  Let's be serious or we both lose out.",Alice,4,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Bob, this is getting silly.  I'm offering a slight edge in my favor, but we're both losing money by the minute.  Let's be reasonable and end this.",Alice,5,
