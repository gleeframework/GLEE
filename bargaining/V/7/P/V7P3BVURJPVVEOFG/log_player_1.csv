"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $400,000, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time, Alice. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, my gain would be $450,000 * 0.8 = $360,000, and Bob's gain would be $550,000 * 0.8 = $440,000.

I'll accept this offer for now. I'm willing to take the smaller share to move closer to a resolution.
