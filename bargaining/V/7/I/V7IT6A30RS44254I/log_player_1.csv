"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 5500/4500 split.  I believe this is a fairer distribution considering the potential for inflation in the coming rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
