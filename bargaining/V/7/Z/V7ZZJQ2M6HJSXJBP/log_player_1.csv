"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20 dollars and keep 80 dollars for myself. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and we don't know what the future holds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. Take 30 and I'll keep 70. It's still a decent split, and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is affecting me more than Bob, I see!

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than 30 dollars. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger hit on me, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll have to keep more for myself. 60 dollars is the minimum I'll accept. Take 40 and let's move on.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more. Take 45 and I'll keep 55. It's a decent compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than 45 dollars. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of my potential gain, I need to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate. 50-50 is the only way I'll accept. Let's split it down the middle and end this game.""
}
```

This offer is a last-ditch attempt to salvage some value, considering the inflation is eating away at my potential gain."
