I'll start by offering Bob a very small amount, just to see if he'll accept. If not, I'll make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Bob is being very greedy, so I will try to make a more equitable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split this time. It's a fair and reasonable proposal."
