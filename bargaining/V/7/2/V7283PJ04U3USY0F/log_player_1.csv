Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, it's better to take the 50% now than risk getting nothing at all in the future due to inflation."
