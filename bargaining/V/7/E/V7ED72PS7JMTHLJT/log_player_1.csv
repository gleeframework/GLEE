"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount to keep you interested in playing.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial 100$, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a fair split, but I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal for myself. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 50$ is actually 50 * 0.9 = 45$.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is now worth less, I'll try to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, Bob. But don't think you're getting off that easy!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the current value of the money, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much ground. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of 45$ is actually 45 * 0.7279 = 32.73$.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept it.
