I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer, aiming to get a large share of the money. I figure I can afford to be generous in the first round, as I'm not sure how Bob is going to react to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to be very aggressive here, essentially flipping the script from my offer.  I'm going to reject this and see if we can come to a more balanced agreement in the next round.  The 5% inflation doesn't significantly impact my calculation right now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor.  I believe this is a fair compromise given that Bob's offer was very unbalanced. I'll continue to be aware of inflation, but I think a more even split is needed for a successful outcome."
