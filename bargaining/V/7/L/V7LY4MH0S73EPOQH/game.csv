9000.0,1000.0,Let's start with a fair-ish split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can adjust it later if you're not happy.,Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a chance to secure a good deal.  The value diminishes with each round, especially for you.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to budge a bit, but 60/40 is too lopsided. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share. Remember, the value keeps decreasing for me with each round.",Alice,3,

5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this and both get a decent share before inflation further erodes your gains.",Bob,4,
