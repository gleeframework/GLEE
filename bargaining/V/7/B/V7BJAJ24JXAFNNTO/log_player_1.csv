In this offer, I propose to take $6,000 for myself and give Bob $4,000. I've attached a message ""Let's split it fairly"" to convey that I'm willing to share the money reasonably.

Please relay this offer to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""

I've made a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I propose to take $5,800 for myself and give Bob $4,200. My message ""Meet me in the middle"" suggests that I'm trying to find a compromise.

Please relay this offer to Bob!"
