Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less, so I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I'd rather try to get a better deal.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, but I'm willing to give you a bit less!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm still willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, the money is now worth only 72.9% of its original value. Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise, and I'd rather not risk waiting for another round.
