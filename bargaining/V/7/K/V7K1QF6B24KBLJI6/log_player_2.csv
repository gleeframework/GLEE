"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's split this nearly evenly, but slightly in my favor. This ensures we both benefit immediately rather than risking losing it all through drawn-out negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Since the money is worth 5% less in each subsequent round, I'm willing to take the risk to try to get more than 49% of the original amount. Additionally, accepting this offer would mean that Alice gets more than half of the money, which doesn't seem fair to me. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, I believe a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. This way, we both get an equal share and can avoid further negotiations that would only decrease the value of our gains due to inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 50/50 split because I believe it's the most reasonable and fair division. Since the money decreases in value by 5% each round, it's in both our interests to come to an agreement as soon as possible. By offering Alice half of the money, I'm hoping she'll see the fairness in the proposal and accept it, allowing us to both walk away with a decent amount before the value drops any further."
