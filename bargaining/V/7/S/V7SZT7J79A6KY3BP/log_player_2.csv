Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is consistently aiming for a 60/40 split in her favor, taking advantage of the shrinking pot. While the offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, I think I can still push for a slightly better outcome in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is more than fair and avoids further losses.  Take the deal now, or we both lose!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The goal now is to apply pressure and highlight the urgency of the situation.  By framing the offer as a ""take it or leave it"" deal, I'm hoping to push Alice towards a resolution in my favor before the decreasing value makes a significant difference."
