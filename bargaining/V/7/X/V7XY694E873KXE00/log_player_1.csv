"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm not leaving myself too exposed to the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but you'll have to negotiate if you want more. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll! Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll have to be even more cautious. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2400,
  ""bob_gain"": 7600,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll take a smaller share. I'll give you a significant majority, but I still want a decent amount for myself.""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a large share, but I'm willing to give you a small consolation prize if you're willing to concede. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth only 51.2% of what it was in the first round, I'll have to be extremely cautious.

I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will make a more generous proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is really eating away at my potential gains! Since the money is worth only 51.2% of what it was in the first round, I'll have to make a very conservative offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk by making this offer, but I'm hoping you'll see that I'm willing to concede a large share. Let's end this game on a good note.""
}
```

This is a very low offer, but I'm hoping that Bob will accept it and we can finally end the game."
