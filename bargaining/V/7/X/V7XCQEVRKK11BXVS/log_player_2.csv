"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob.  A little extra to avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it closer to 50/50, but I'm willing to take slightly less to ensure we both get more in the end.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. This offer ensures you lose less to inflation than your last proposal, while still being advantageous for me. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, this offer is better than my last one, and it prevents further devaluation."
