Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be efficient, Alice. I understand this offer favors me, but consider the rapid inflation hitting your returns with each round. A deal now secures you something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
