"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we need to account for. Let's make this a quick deal. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle with a 50-50 split. It's a fair compromise considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise given the inflation and the fact that Bob's previous offer was not satisfactory."
