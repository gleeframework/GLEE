"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the 5% inflation that will occur with each passing round. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid unnecessary negotiations."
