I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a small share.  I'm hoping he'll accept it, as we both get something, and we don't have to risk the money depreciating.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a bit cheeky, but I'm not going to give in to his greedy tactics just yet.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal, hoping he realizes that we both need to compromise if we want to get anything at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing an even split this time.  I think it's fair, and hopefully Bob will see that we're both better off with a 50/50 split than risking getting nothing at all.  Let's see what he says!"
