Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is more than fair. You are losing value rapidly! I suggest you accept before it's too late for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the situation is getting tighter, accepting 350,000 is a significant loss compared to what I could potentially get.  Alice is clearly using time pressure to her advantage, but I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A straight 50/50 split. This is the most fair deal. Take it or leave it, we're running out of time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time pressure is becoming critical.  While I want a larger share, proposing a 50/50 split at this stage:

* **Projects Strength:** It shows I'm willing to be fair but won't be lowballed.
* **Simplicity:**  It's an easy decision for Alice under pressure.
* **Finality:**  The ""take it or leave it"" signals I'm serious, increasing the chance she accepts rather than risking everything."
