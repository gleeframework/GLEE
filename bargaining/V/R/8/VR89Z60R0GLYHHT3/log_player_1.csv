Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be aggressive in the first round.  I'm aiming to get most of the money while still leaving Bob a small amount.  Since I'm the one making the offer, I'll need Bob to accept.  If he doesn't, he has to counter-offer and I might get a worse deal later!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much better deal for me than the initial offer.  Even with the 5% inflation, I'm getting half of the money.  It's a fair split, and I don't want to risk getting less in the following rounds."
