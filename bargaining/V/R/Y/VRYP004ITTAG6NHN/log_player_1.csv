"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I'm going for a very aggressive first offer.  I'll take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. This is risky, as he could easily reject it. But, if he does, I'll have the chance to make another offer in the next round. The goal is to get as much as possible quickly before inflation kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is essentially the same as my first offer, just reversed. It's still too risky for me to accept. Even though my gains are unchanged, I'm willing to gamble on getting a better offer in the next round. I'm still hoping to get the majority of the money, and I'm confident I can negotiate a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999990, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly. While I still want the majority, I'm increasing Bob's share a bit to make the offer more appealing.  He rejected a very lopsided offer in the last round, so I'm hoping a slightly more balanced offer will entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 999990 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided. While the money is worth less for him due to inflation, he's still offering me a meager $10.  I'm confident I can get a better deal, even with the risk of further inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999900, ""bob_gain"": 100}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share again, hoping to find a sweet spot where he'll accept. He's clearly unwilling to accept anything less than 10% of the total, and with each round, his offer is becoming less appealing due to inflation. I'm aiming for a compromise that benefits both of us before the inflation gets out of hand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor, even with the impact of inflation.  I'm still aiming for a larger share of the money, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small amount. With the risk of further inflation, I need to be strategic and hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a risky move, but I'm increasing Bob's share to 1,000.  Inflation is starting to hurt Bob's offers significantly, and he seems to be holding firm at 10%. I'm hoping that this offer, while still very favorable to me, shows some compromise and might finally convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too much in his favor, even with the significant impact of inflation on his share.  While his offer has become more appealing, I'm not willing to settle for a small share.  I'm still hoping for a larger percentage, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This is a significant move. I'm increasing Bob's share to 10,000, but I'm still taking 990,000. This offer is a last-ditch effort to get a deal done.  Inflation is hitting both of us hard now, and if we don't come to an agreement, we both lose. This offer is close to the point where Bob might accept, but it's still a substantial win for me."
