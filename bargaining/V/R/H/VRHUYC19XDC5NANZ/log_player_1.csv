"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. This is a 50/50 split. Accept this and we'll both get the most we can. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this 50/50 split. It's a fair offer, but I was hoping to get a bit more, considering I'm the one who made the first offer and took the risk of being rejected.

However, since Bob's offer is a fair one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value due to inflation, I'll accept his offer.
