"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a larger share this round, but still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of 20 is equivalent to 16 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with the large disparity in Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share this round, but I'm not willing to give up too much. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.""

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money!

With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of 10 is equivalent to around 5.4 in the first round.

Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not willing to give up such a large share. Here's my response:

With the money worth 67.23% less than in the first round, my gain of 5 is equivalent to around 1.88 in the first round.

Bob's offer is extremely lopsided, and I'm not willing to give up such a small share. Here's my response:

  ""bob_gain"": 90,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a large share, but I'm not willing to give up more than that. I'm starting to think we should just split it now.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a very large share, but I'm still trying to hold on to some of the remaining value. I'm starting to think that splitting it 50/50 might be the best option at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has decimated the value of the money!
