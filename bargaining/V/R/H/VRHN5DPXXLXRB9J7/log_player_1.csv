"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start with 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $60 and Bob $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the actual amounts I'd get are:

* My gain: $30 * 0.8 = $24
* Bob's gain: $70 * 0.8 = $56

I'm not thrilled with the 24-56 split, but I'll accept the offer to move on to the next round.
