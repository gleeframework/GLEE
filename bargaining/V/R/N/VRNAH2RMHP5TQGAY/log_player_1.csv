"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a decent split. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,000 in the current round, but it's equivalent to $5,000 in the first round. Not bad, but I'm hoping for more.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. This is my best offer so far. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, with me getting $7,000 and Bob getting $3,000. This is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, Alice. I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount. If I accept this offer, I'll get $2,500 in the current round, but it's equivalent to $4,864 in the first round. Not bad, but I'm still hoping for more.

I'll reject the offer for now.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. This is my best offer yet. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 6:4 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a bit more aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. I need a significant majority to make this worth my while. You're running out of time! 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on me now!

Since the money is worth 67.23% less, I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount. If I accept this offer, I'll get $1,000 in the current round, but it's equivalent to $3,012 in the first round. It's a very small fraction of the original amount, but I'm starting to get desperate.

I'll reject the offer for now, but I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. This is a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it! I'm running out of time!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with me getting $5,000 and Bob getting $5,000. This is a last-ditch effort to get a decent share of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this offer and we can finally settle this."
