Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a small amount. I'm hoping he'll accept it, but if not, I'll have to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  Although I'm getting less than I wanted initially, the inflation means my gain is worth significantly less.  It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing if we keep going."
