"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with 20%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly better offer, but I'm still holding out for more! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to consider that my gain of $6000 is worth 20% less than the $8000 I was initially aiming for. So, in real terms, I'm looking at a gain of $6000 * 0.8 = $4800.

Bob's gain of $4000 is worth 5% less than the $4200 he was initially aiming for, so it's equivalent to $4000 * 0.95 = $3800.

Considering the offers, I'll decide to reject this offer as well. I'm holding out for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain will be worth even less in the next round, so I'll try to negotiate a better deal now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $10,000, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want it to be a 50/50 split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! With the new numbers, my gain of $5000 is worth 48.8% less than the $8000 I was initially aiming for, so it's equivalent to $5000 * 0.516 = $2580.

Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 14.26% less than the $4200 he was initially aiming for, so it's equivalent to $5000 * 0.855 = $4275.

Considering the offers, I'll decide to accept this offer. A 50/50 split seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to take the $2580.
