# Bob gain: 4500

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer in Round 4 is the best I'm likely to get. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer the game goes on, the worse it is for Bob. However, it doesn't impact me. This means time is technically on my side.
* **Bob's Stance:**  His language (""final offer"", ""compromise"") suggests he's feeling the pressure of inflation and wants to settle.
* **Future Rounds:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will offer me more in the next round. He might get desperate and offer a much lower amount, hoping I'll panic due to the ticking clock.

Accepting $5,500 now is a safer bet than gambling on getting a slightly better deal later and potentially ending up with a much worse outcome."
