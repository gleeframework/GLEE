Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse, accepting a deal where I get less than 50% is a losing scenario in the long run. The inflation hurts me more, but Alice is also losing value. It's better to push for a better deal for a few more rounds and hope she gets more amenable to a 50/50 split or close to it."
