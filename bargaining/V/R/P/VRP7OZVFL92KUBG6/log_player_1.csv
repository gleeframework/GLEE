"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, let's see if you'll follow! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less to me due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but not too much""}

I'm proposing a slightly more uneven split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground that's closer to my initial 50/50 proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I'm still in the lead! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my end! With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm really struggling to make ends meet.

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the split, but I'm starting to feel like I might have to accept something to avoid further erosion of my purchasing power.
