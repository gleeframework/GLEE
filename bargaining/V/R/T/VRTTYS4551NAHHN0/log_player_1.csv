"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in this first round, hoping Bob will be willing to accept a smaller share to get something at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, I know that the money will be worth even less in the next round. I'm hoping to get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6400, ""bob_gain"": 3600}
```

I'm taking a smaller share than in the first round, but since Bob's offer was so unfavorable, I'm willing to make a more reasonable proposal. I'm hoping this will be enough to tempt him, especially given the potential for even less in the next round."
