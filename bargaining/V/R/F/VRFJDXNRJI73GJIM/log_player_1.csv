"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, given the inflation we have to consider.  Let's end the game here. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think a 60/40 split in Bob's favor is fair, considering the inflation has affected him less than me. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40 in his favor, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split.""
}
```"
