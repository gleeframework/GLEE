"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice offers next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, given the inflation we have to consider.  Let's end the game here.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is a good compromise.  Inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk losing more money.  Let's end the game."
