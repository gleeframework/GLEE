"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to start with a relatively generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept. Since I have a smaller inflation rate, I want to secure a good chunk of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, especially considering the inflation rates. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my initial offer slightly, but still keeping a larger share for myself.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that his inflation rate is higher, and will be more inclined to accept a slightly smaller portion to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than my initial offer, especially considering the inflation rates. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but at a slower rate.  I'm hoping that Bob will start to feel the pressure of his higher inflation rate and be more willing to accept a smaller portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very bad considering how much money I will lose due to inflation.  I will keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to lower my offer further, but not by much.  Bob's inflation rate is catching up to him now, and he's losing more money than I am with each passing round. I'm hoping he'll realize that he needs to accept a smaller share before it's too late."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is terrible. Even though I'm losing money, he's losing more than double what I am.  It's better to risk another round and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a larger share.  The inflation is starting to hurt both of us, but Bob is losing more than I am, so he's the one who needs to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse, and the inflation is really hurting him now.  I'm going to stick to my strategy and continue to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

We are very close to the end of the game.  The inflation is really hurting both of us now. However, Bob is losing more than me, and I am hoping he will accept this offer."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a terrible offer. I'm losing a huge amount of money due to inflation, and Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.  Even though it's the last round, I would rather get nothing than accept such an unfair deal."
