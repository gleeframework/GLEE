Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm serious about the inflation impact. This offer still gives you a significant share, and it's the best you'll get from me. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me. While her offer isn't terrible, I need to show her I'm serious about getting a larger share.  The inflation hurts her more than me, so I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a fair deal.  I need to factor in the inflation, and this gives us both a reasonable share.  Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are reflecting that.  She's trying to frame a 75/25 split as ""fair"" while the inflation is eating away at her share.  I need to hold strong and push for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 750000,
""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this.  The deal is getting worse for you every round. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to turn up the pressure. I'm mirroring her previous offer but switching our positions. This emphasizes how much the inflation is hurting her and makes my offer seem more ""fair"" in comparison. By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm not willing to negotiate much further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's time to be realistic. This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but I need to be pragmatic. While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice is clearly digging in her heels, and we're getting into dangerous territory with the inflation. Accepting this offer guarantees a decent share (which is still a significant amount of money) and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if the negotiations completely break down."
