Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fairer split. I'll take $900,000, you get $100,000. This way, we both get a decent amount to begin with, and we can avoid losing too much money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you $200,000, which is still a significant gain for you, especially with the inflation factor. We're both losing money with every round, so let's end this before it's too late. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation. While $200,000 is a significant amount of money, it's a tiny fraction of the total and heavily favors Bob. I need to hold out for a better deal."
