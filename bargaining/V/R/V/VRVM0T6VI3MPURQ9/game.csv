950000.0,50000.0,"Hi Bob, let's start off with a reasonable offer. I take $950,000, you get $50,000.  It's in your best interest to settle this early as the money loses value with each round.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"Let's start with a fairer split. I'll take $900,000, you get $100,000. This way, we both get a decent amount to begin with, and we can avoid losing too much money to inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Bob, that's still too low for me. How about I take $850,000 and you get $150,000?  Let's settle this before we both lose out more to inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
200000.0,800000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to give you $200,000, which is still a significant gain for you, especially with the inflation factor. We're both losing money with every round, so let's end this before it's too late.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you $250,000 - that's a quarter of the pie! I'm taking a significant hit from inflation with each round, so take this offer seriously.",Alice,5,
