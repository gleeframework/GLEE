"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and taking the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

The original $1,000,000 is now worth $800,000 (80% of the original value). If we split it evenly, I would get $400,000, not $500,000.

So, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 20% inflation, the money is now worth 64% of its original value ($640,000). I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, $600,000, and take $400,000. It's a generous offer, don't you think?""
}
