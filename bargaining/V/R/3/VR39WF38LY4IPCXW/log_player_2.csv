"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100000 and take the rest. It's a good starting point, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While a fair starting point, it's too much for Alice. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you the majority, $600000, and take $400000. It's a generous offer, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the money is worth less, this offer is still a significant improvement from the first round, and it's likely Alice will only offer less in future rounds."
