"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, I propose 60/40 in my favor. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your offer was unfair to me. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding the Stakes:** Alice's offer was heavily skewed in her favor. It's important to signal that I'm not going to accept an unfair deal.
* **Leveraging Inflation:**  While the money devalues for both of us, Alice's devaluation is much faster. Delaying is to my advantage. My offer might seem less appealing in later rounds, so making a strong stand now is key. 
* **Finality:** Stating this is my final offer adds pressure. Alice knows if she rejects this, the next offer (if I even choose to negotiate further) will likely be even less favorable to her."
