Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell. 70/30 is a good offer, but I can do better. How about 85/15? You'll still get a decent share, and I'll get the majority. It's a fair deal, don't you think?

While I'd prefer a better split, it's clear that Bob's greed is relentless, and I'm losing more and more money with each round.  It's better to take what I can get before inflation eats away any more of my share."
