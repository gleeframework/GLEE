"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, 60-40! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but my offer is more equitable considering the inflation we face each round.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject it, demonstrating that a more balanced approach is needed.
* **My counter-offer:** While still giving Alice a slight advantage, my offer acknowledges the decreasing value of the money. This offer encourages Alice to settle now, rather than risk losing more value in future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's meet halfway between our previous offers. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to appear reasonable by ""meeting halfway,"" but this still heavily favors her. The inflation disproportionately affects me, and accepting this offer would mean settling for a significantly smaller portion than what I could have gotten in the first round.  I need to push for a more balanced outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time.  This offer still gives you a larger share, but reflects the urgency of settling before the money loses even more value.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing pressure:**  With each round, the value shrinks, putting pressure on both of us to reach a deal.
* **Conceding slightly:** My offer acknowledges the need for compromise. While still favoring me slightly in terms of raw numbers, the rapid inflation means Alice is losing more potential value with each refusal. 
* **Urgency:** Highlighting the time constraint encourages Alice to prioritize a deal now over an even less favorable outcome later."
