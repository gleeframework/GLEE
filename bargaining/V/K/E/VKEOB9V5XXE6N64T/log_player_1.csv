The final division is $5600 for you and $4400 for Bob.\n\nLet's analyze the game:\n\n* In the first round, you offered Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount. Bob rejected your offer because he wanted more.\n* In the second round, you increased your offer to $4200, which is 42% of the total amount. Bob still rejected your offer because he wanted more.\n* In the third round, you increased your offer again to $4400, which is 44% of the total amount. Bob finally accepted your offer.\n\nAs you can see, Bob was trying to negotiate for a better deal, and you were willing to compromise to reach an agreement. However, you also made it clear that you had a limit to how much you were willing to give up, which helped to bring the negotiation to a close.\n\nIt's also worth noting that the inflation mechanic added an extra layer of complexity to the game. Since the money was worth less with each passing round, you and Bob had to take that into account when making your offers. In the end, you were able to reach a mutually acceptable agreement, but the inflation mechanic made the negotiation more challenging.\n\nI hope this analysis helps! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to play again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","### Bot: Round 2\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $5500 is actually equivalent to $5225 in the first round. Considering I initially offered Bob $4000 and he rejected it, I think I can try to negotiate for a better deal.\n\nLet's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Bot: Round 3\n{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'll try to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll offer Bob a bit more than before, but still try to maintain a favorable split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5400 
# Bob gain: 4600 
Do you accept this offer?","### Bot: Round 4\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I think it's time to accept Bob's offer. With the money being worth 14.26% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, it's clear that further negotiations would only lead to diminishing returns.\n\nBob's offer of $5400 for me is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it to conclude the game. Let's finalize the deal!"
