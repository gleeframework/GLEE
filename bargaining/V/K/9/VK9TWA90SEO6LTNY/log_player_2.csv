"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your loss, this is fair 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's just split it evenly before inflation eats up all our potential gains.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting, settle now 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While the deal is getting worse, accepting anything less than a 50/50 split at this point feels like I'm letting her win. There's still time to negotiate, even if it means risking a worse outcome later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be reasonable, but I need a better deal than that. This is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** It's time to start getting serious.  A slight edge to Alice might be necessary to get her to agree, but I'm hoping the ""final offer"" makes her reconsider her position and go for a more even split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one, but the clock is ticking. My potential gains are rapidly dwindling. If I reject this, there's a good chance Alice will push for an even worse deal in the next round. Accepting now secures me something, even if it's not ideal. It's better than risking a complete loss if we fail to agree."
