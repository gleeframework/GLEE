"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $60, leaving Bob with $40. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness, hoping he will accept this division to avoid further rounds where the value of money decreases for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  Let's split a bit more in my favor this time to make up for the first round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI choose to reject Bob's offer because I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds. Although the money's value decreases for Bob with each round, it remains constant for me, giving me an advantage in prolonged negotiations. By rejecting this offer, I aim to pressure Bob into accepting a division more favorable to me, as he faces the risk of the money devaluing further in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering your loss, this is fair""}\n\nIn this round, I propose a division slightly more favorable to me than my initial offer, but still reasonable considering the decreasing value of money for Bob. The message aims to acknowledge Bob's loss due to inflation and position this offer as a fair compromise, encouraging him to accept it before the value of his potential gain decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly before inflation eats up all our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer of an even split because, given the current situation, I have the upper hand in negotiations. The money's value remains constant for me but decreases significantly for Bob with each round. An even split at this point would not maximize my gain, considering Bob's increasing motivation to settle due to the devaluing of his potential share. By rejecting this offer, I aim to push Bob towards accepting a less favorable division in the next rounds, as the pressure of inflation mounts on his side."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, settle now""}\n\nIn this round, I increase my proposed share, leveraging the pressure of inflation on Bob's potential gains. The message is direct, emphasizing the impact of inflation and suggesting that settling now would be in Bob's best interest before his share devalues further. This approach aims to create a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to accept this division to salvage as much value as possible from his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be reasonable, but I need a better deal than that. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his claim that it's his final offer, the negotiation dynamics haven't changed significantly. The money's value continues to decrease for Bob, increasing his motivation to settle, while my position remains unaffected by inflation. Given the previous rounds and the relative stability of my potential gains, I believe there's still room to negotiate a more favorable division. By rejecting this offer, I'm calling Bob's bluff on his ""final offer,"" aiming to force him into an even less favorable position in the next rounds, where the threat of walking away with nothing becomes more pronounced."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Last chance before it's too late""}\n\nIn this round, I further increase my proposed share, taking advantage of Bob's weakening position due to inflation. The message emphasizes urgency, suggesting that this is Bob's last chance to salvage any significant value from his share. By framing the situation as critical, I aim to persuade Bob that accepting this division is preferable to risking further devaluation or potentially walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
