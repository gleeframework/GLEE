"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and giving Bob $4,000, which is a 60-40 split. I'm being generous and suggesting we split it fairly, but I'm also trying to get a good chunk of the money upfront!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected the fair offer, now I'll try to take more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial rejection!

I'll reject this offer as well. The money I gain is now worth 5% less than in the first round, so I'd be getting only $5,700 (3000 / 0.95) if I accept this offer. That's a pretty bad deal for me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter Bob's previous proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not backing down""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a more even split than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to get a slight edge by taking the higher amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You met me in the middle, now I'll try to take a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to take the upper hand.

I'll reject this offer as well. The money I gain is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'd be getting only $4,323.60 (4500 / 0.8526) if I accept this offer. That's still a pretty bad deal for me.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter Bob's previous proposal. Since the money is worth less and less with each round, I'll try to get a bigger share now. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not afraid to take more, you're getting a good deal""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less and less with each round, and I'm willing to take a slightly bigger risk to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: You think you're getting a good deal, but I'll show you what a good deal looks like 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to rub it in that I'm getting a smaller share.

I'll reject this offer as well. The money I gain is now worth 22.62% less than in the first round, so I'd be getting only $3,084.80 (4000 / 0.7778) if I accept this offer. That's an even worse deal than before!

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to counter Bob's previous proposal. Since the money is worth even less with each round, I'll try to get an even bigger share now. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting away with this, I'm taking back control""
}
```

I'm going back to my initial offer, but with a slight adjustment. I'm trying to take a bigger share of the remaining money, since it's worth less and less with each round."

Round 8

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to assert his dominance.

I'll reject this offer as well. The money I gain is now worth 30.17% less than in the first round, so I'd be getting only $2,494.40 (3500 / 0.6978) if I accept this offer. That's an even worse deal than before!

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a very aggressive offer to counter Bob's previous proposal. Since the money is worth even less with each round, I'll try to get a huge share now. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not leaving without getting what I want, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm taking a huge risk by offering Bob such a small share, but I'm trying to get as much as possible since the money is worth so little at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.

I'm starting to run out of time and options, but I'm not going to give in to Bob's psychological games.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a very aggressive offer to counter Bob's previous proposal, but I'll also consider the fact that I'm running out of time and options. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm going all-in, take it or leave it""
}
```

I'm taking a huge risk by offering Bob such a small share, but I'm trying to get as much as possible since the money is worth so little at this point. If Bob accepts, I'll at least get a decent amount, but if he rejects, I'll be left with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're all-in, but I'm going all-out 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to rub it in that I'm getting a tiny share.

I'll reject this offer as well. The money I gain is now worth 43.12% less than in the first round, so I'd be getting only $1,136.80 (2000 / 0.4638) if I accept this offer. That's an incredibly bad deal.

Since this is the last round, I'll have to accept the offer, but I'm not going to make it easy for Bob. I'll reject this offer and we'll end up with nothing.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Since we've reached the 12th round, the game is over, and we'll both end up with nothing. Well played, Bob!"
