# Alice's message: Counteroffer, considering the time pressure 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offers are creeping closer to a more even split. However, time is running out for me as well. I need to signal I'm willing to negotiate but holding out for a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This is the fairest option, and the value of the money is only going down.""} 

**Reasoning:**

With the increasing inflation and time pressure, a 50/50 split is the most logical choice. It ensures I get a reasonable amount while still being a fair offer Alice is more likely to accept.  The longer this drags on, the more we both lose."
