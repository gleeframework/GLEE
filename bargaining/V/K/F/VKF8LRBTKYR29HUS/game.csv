30.0,70.0,"Your split wasn't considering the inflation. I'm proposing 70/30 -  think about it, it'll be worth much less next round for you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
40.0,60.0,"Okay, I see your point about inflation.  I'm willing to compromise - let's go with a 40/60 split.  This way, we both get a decent amount, and we don't have to worry about the value dropping further.",Alice,3,
