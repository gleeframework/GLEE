"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a slightly more aggressive split, but still reasonable 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to keep negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer, but still reasonable considering the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up! With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can still get a better deal. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'd like to push for a larger share. I'm not willing to accept a 45-55 split, especially since Bob is getting a larger share than I am."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game soon, but I'm still open to negotiating further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really starting to hurt! With the money being worth 40.95% less for me and 67.23% less for Bob, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the reduced value of the money, I think a 48-52 split is a reasonable compromise. I'm not willing to push for more at this point, and I'd rather take the deal than risk ending up with nothing if we don't agree on a split soon."
