"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to get started!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the original $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's make this quick! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would get are:

* My gain: 45 * 0.9 = 40.5 (since my gain is worth 10% less)
* Bob's gain: 55 * 0.95 = 52.25 (since his gain is worth 5% less)

I'm not too thrilled about the 52.25 for Bob, but I think it's a fair offer considering the circumstances. I'll accept it.
