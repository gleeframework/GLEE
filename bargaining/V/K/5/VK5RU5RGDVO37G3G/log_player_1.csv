"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's get the game started! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This offer is quite straightforward: I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets $0. It's a bold move, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money equally. It's fair and straightforward. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it equally, huh? That's a reasonable proposal.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to give up my potential for a larger share just yet. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate kicking in, I'll aim to get a bigger share this round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a better deal this time, but I'm still the smart one!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a bit more generous than my initial proposal, but I'm still keeping a majority of the share."
