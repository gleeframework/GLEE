Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money! This offer ensures we both lose less to inflation. Let's be sensible. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer, or I'm going to drive us both into the ground.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Accept it, and we both walk away with something. Reject it, and we both lose out even more. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, Alice is right. If I reject this offer, the potential gains in further rounds will likely be outweighed by the increasing inflation. Accepting this offer cuts my losses.
