"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't get the better deal if you don't negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a pretty one-sided deal. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer.""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 10% toll on the money's value, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give away the majority of the money. Let's talk!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to give Bob the lion's share of the money just yet!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give you the majority, but I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is hitting me hard! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm feeling the pinch.

However, I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, which is even less favorable than my previous offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to accept such a low offer. I need to get a better deal to make up for the lost value due to inflation.""
}
```

I'll keep negotiating!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away the majority. Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that balances my desire for a fair share with the need to account for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, you'll have to make a better offer 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings! With the money I gain being worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

However, Bob's offer is even more extreme than before, and I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's an insult! I won't accept such a small fraction of the money. I need a better deal to make up for the lost value.""
}
```

I'll try to make a final push for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll and my potential earnings dwindling, I'll have to make a bold move. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a risk and give you a slightly smaller share. I need to get a decent amount to make up for the lost value.""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal, but I know it's a risk, and I might end up with less than I want."
