Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm meeting you halfway. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.  Don't let time erode the value further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims to meet me halfway, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the accelerating inflation working against me.  I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
