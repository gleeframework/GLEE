"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the funds with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still think 2:1 is a more reasonable ratio considering the diminishing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
