Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a little. How about 55/45, with me taking 55 this time? Let's get this done before the money is worth even less! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is still trying to take a larger share while disguising it as a compromise.  While the money is decreasing in value, it's better to hold out for a fairer deal. It's too early to settle for a less advantageous split."
