I propose to keep $9,000 and give $1,000 to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering $8,000 for myself and $2,000 for Bob. While inflation is a factor, I still believe I deserve a larger share considering I initiated the game and offered a significantly better deal in the first round."
