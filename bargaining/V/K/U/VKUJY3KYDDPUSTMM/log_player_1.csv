"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent chunk.""}

I'm proposing that I take 800,000 and Bob gets 200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a slightly different distribution. This might be more appealing for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced gains due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I was hoping to get a better deal, considering the initial 1,000,000 was already reduced by 20% due to inflation. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. This split is more balanced, considering the inflation. Let's take a closer look at this one.""}

I'm proposing that I take 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000."
