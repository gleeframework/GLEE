Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I'd like to get a larger share to compensate.

I reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the money is worth even less. I'll need to be careful. This offer seems slightly better for me than the previous one, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll accept this offer.
