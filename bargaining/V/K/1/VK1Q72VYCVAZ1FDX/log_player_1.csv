Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that benefits me more, but still gives Bob a small amount.  Let's see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a terrible offer! While it's true that the money is worth less, it's still a huge drop from my previous proposal.  I'll reject this and make my own counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'll reduce my share slightly to keep the negotiations moving, but I'm still aiming for a significantly larger share. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise a bit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still incredibly unfair.  Even though the money is worth less, I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll keep trying to negotiate a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but still aiming for a majority. The inflation is starting to bite, but I believe Bob will eventually need to compromise if he wants to get anything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too one-sided. While the inflation is affecting the value, I'm not ready to give up such a large percentage of the money.  I'll try to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm continuing to compromise, but I need to keep a decent share to avoid losing too much to inflation. I'm hoping that with each round, Bob will start to realize that he needs to make some concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too one-sided, even with the inflation taking its toll. I'm not willing to accept such a small share.  I'll keep negotiating for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I still need to keep a decent portion to offset the inflation. With only a few rounds left, I'm hoping Bob will finally realize that he needs to meet me halfway to get any money at all."
