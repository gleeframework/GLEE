"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start the game and I can get my share of the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of 800,000 is still worth 800,000, but Bob's share of 200,000 is now worth 190,000 (95% of 200,000).

Bob's new offer is 400,000 for me and 600,000 for him, which is a 50-50 split, but considering the inflation, I'd be getting 400,000 in real value, and he'd be getting 570,000.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, so I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this round, hoping to get a better share of the money before Bob makes his next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the real values considering the inflation:

My share of 700,000 is still worth 700,000, but Bob's share of 300,000 is now worth 257,143 (86.74% of 300,000).

Bob's new offer is 450,000 for me and 550,000 for him, which is a 45-55 split. Considering the inflation, I'd be getting 450,000 in real value, and he'd be getting 476,785.

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, but it's getting closer to a 50-50 split, so I'll accept this offer.
