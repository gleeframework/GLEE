"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking $9000 for myself and giving $1000 to Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I have the first offer and need to account for potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the 10% inflation, 5000 is better than the 9000 I was initially hoping for. This is a fair split, and I don't want to risk further rounds and potentially get an even worse offer."
