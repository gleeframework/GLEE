"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the shrinking value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can get a better deal, considering the inflation is affecting both of us equally."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  I'm willing to take a bit less, but I need to get a better deal than the last round.  Let's end this now before we lose more value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the significant loss of value due to inflation, I think it's wise to accept this offer and end the game before we both lose even more."
