Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer. Here it is:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer is now 50/50, I'll take it. The inflation has made the money worth less, so this is a good opportunity to split it evenly.
