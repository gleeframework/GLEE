"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a relatively even split, considering I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split.  I think this is a more equitable way to start. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than before, I'd rather get a slightly larger share now than risk waiting for a better offer later.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
