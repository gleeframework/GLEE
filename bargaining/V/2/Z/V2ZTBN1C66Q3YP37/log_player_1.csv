Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob. This is because I want to try and end the game quickly.  I'm also hoping that Bob will feel like he's getting a good deal, which will make him more likely to accept the offer.  Of course, I'm also aware of the inflation factor and want to avoid getting into a protracted negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep more of the money, I think it's best to accept this offer.  The inflation factor means that each round is riskier.  There's no guarantee that I can get a better offer in the next round, and there's a real chance that I could end up with less money if the inflation continues to grow.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and it's better than risking getting a worse deal later on."
