  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}"

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's proposal is reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but let's not lose too much more to inflation.  Let's split it closer to 60/40, and we can both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm willing to accept, but I still think I can get a better deal. The 60/40 split is a bit too generous for Bob, considering the initial amount was supposed to be split 50/50.
