"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this time. 60-40 for me, and I'll give you the chance to propose in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I don't like the 60-40 split in Bob's favor, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not accept this offer and try to do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90%). I'll aim to get a better deal now.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 54-46 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, considering the inflation."
