Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm meeting you halfway between my last offer and yours. Don't let inflation eat away your share! 
# Bob gain: 437500 
# Alice gain: 562500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is trying to make it seem urgent due to inflation, time is on my side.  She's consistently shown a willingness to accept more than half. As long as my offers are in the realm of possibility,  I can push her closer to a 50/50 split, or even slightly in my favor, as the rounds progress."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 512500, ""alice_gain"": 487500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. This split is fair and avoids a drawn-out negotiation. We both lose if we wait too long.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing money to inflation, I'm being generous by not lowering my offer further. Take it before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 443750 
# Alice gain: 556250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice seems unwilling to budge much further. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting a much worse offer in later rounds, especially with inflation eating into my potential gains.  It's better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting even less later."
