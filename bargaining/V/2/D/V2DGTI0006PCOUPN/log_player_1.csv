"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and offering Bob 100,000. This is a generous offer considering the inflation.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll have to see what he proposes and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still not fair. I'm willing to take the risk and go to the next round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split.  Since the money is worth less for me due to inflation, I'm trying to find a balance that is more equitable while still offering Bob a slightly better deal.  I hope this will incentivize him to accept."
