Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer now, or we both risk leaving with nothing! It's far more than you'd get in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the inflation is hitting hard, Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation. While $400,000 seems tempting given the depreciation, holding out for one more round could force Alice to take a less greedy approach.  If she's serious about not leaving empty-handed, she'll have to offer a larger share to Bob in the next round."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want to leave with something. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this before we both lose out.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  Alice knows the value is decreasing rapidly for Bob. By proposing a 50/50 split, we are showing that we are serious about getting a fair deal and putting the pressure on her to avoid getting nothing.  There's a risk she'll reject this, but the potential reward of securing a fair split outweighs the risk of going into further rounds with diminishing returns."
