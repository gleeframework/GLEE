"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Time is money, and every round it's worth less and less for us! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept such a lopsided deal. We have 12 rounds, and I can propose a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more balanced split.  I'm proposing 55/45 in my favor. We both benefit from getting a deal done quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this settled.  I'm countering with 55/45 in my favor.  It's closer to my initial offer, and the clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a good deal for me, and it's a reasonable compromise. The risk of going on for too long and getting nothing is too high."
