"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give a bit more, but not too much. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair deal considering the time pressure and the inflation working against me. Let's close this deal now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious, but I can still afford to wait. This is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, hoping the inflation pressure forces me to accept a bad deal. While the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, I still need to push for a better split. Accepting 43 now sets a bad precedent and she's unlikely to offer anything significantly better in the next couple of rounds.  It's a risk, but holding out a little longer is necessary."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is the most logical split. Accepting anything less would be foolish on my part, and I know you're smart enough to see that.  50/50, take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the inflation is biting hard. I need to make a strong move to end this quickly. 
* **Shifting Power:** Alice's offers haven't changed significantly, indicating she's confident in her position. A strong, seemingly final offer might make her reconsider her strategy.
* **The Psychology:** By stating it's ""foolish"" to accept less, I'm subtly implying she'd be foolish to reject this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, and I'm still in a good position. This is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough spot! Alice is clearly reading the situation well.  However, accepting now would mean getting less than half of the original value. I need to consider my options carefully.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling the Bluff:** Alice might be bluffing about her strong position. She knows the pressure is on me, so she's using psychological tactics. 
* **Last Stand:** I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to signal I'm not giving in easily. Accepting this offer sets a terrible precedent for future rounds. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** While the difference between 44 and a potential better offer is shrinking due to inflation, it's still worth fighting for a couple more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  You're cutting it incredibly close. I'm offering you more than I've asked for at any point. Take the deal, and let's both walk away with something.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Shift:** I need to change tactics. Offering slightly more than Alice is a calculated risk to break the deadlock and appeal to her sense of reason. 
* **Strong Language:** Using words like ""ridiculous"" and ""cutting it close"" emphasizes the urgency and subtly puts pressure on Alice.
* **Final Push:**  I'm gambling that Alice is risk-averse enough to take a small win rather than risk getting nothing in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still in control, and you're running out of time. This is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","This is agonizing! Alice is relentless, but I refuse to believe she'll risk getting nothing at all. It's time for a final gamble.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:**  I'm betting Alice is bluffing about her confidence. She might be trying to break my spirit before the final rounds. 
* **Unacceptable Terms:**  Accepting 45 now means losing more than half the value of the original amount. Even with inflation, I believe I can still secure a marginally better deal. 
* **Risky, But Necessary:** This is a high-stakes gamble, but with only three rounds left, I need to hold my ground and hope Alice cracks."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  We're down to the wire. I'm offering you 45, which is more than you've offered me at any point. Take it, or we BOTH lose out.  Don't let greed ruin this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Ultimate Bluff:** I need to project extreme confidence. This offer, while still in my favor, suggests I'm making a significant concession to avoid mutual loss.
* **Guilt Trip:**  By emphasizing that ""greed"" could ruin the deal, I'm putting the blame on Alice if she rejects. 
* **Finality:** The tone and language leave no room for interpretation. This is my last stand, and Alice needs to understand the severity of the situation. 
* **Slight Hope:** While risky, there's a slight chance that facing the possibility of walking away with nothing might finally sway Alice to accept a less favorable split."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 89.26% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're almost out of time, and I'm still not budging much. This is my new offer. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","This is torture! Alice is playing hardball, but there's still a sliver of hope. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Last Breath of Hope:**  Two rounds remain. If I accept now, I'm rewarding her ruthless tactics and accepting a terrible deal. There's a tiny chance she might panic in the final round and offer something better.
* **Principle:**  At this point, it's about more than the money. It's about not letting Alice win after such a ruthless display. Even a slightly better outcome in the final round is a symbolic victory.
* **Unpredictability:** Alice has been consistent, but there's no guarantee she won't change her strategy at the last moment. This uncertainty, however small, fuels my decision to hold on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 11.
Round 12
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, you've pushed this to the absolute limit. This is insane! You're getting a fantastic deal - take it before we both end up with NOTHING. Don't be foolish, Alice. This is your last chance.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Desperation Play:**  This is the final act. I need to make Alice believe I'm willing to walk away, even if it means getting nothing. A drastic offer is the only option left.
* **Reversal of Power:** By demanding 60 for myself, I'm flipping the script and portraying Alice as the unreasonable one if she refuses.
* **Emotional Appeal:** The language is deliberately strong - ""insane,"" ""foolish,"" ""last chance"" - to evoke a sense of urgency and even fear of missing out.
* **Slim Hope:** While the odds are stacked against me, there's a tiny chance that Alice, faced with the potential loss of everything, will crack under pressure and accept.

This is it. The final gamble."
