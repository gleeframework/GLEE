"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see if we can do better from here!""
}
```

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split, especially since I'm not sure how much the inflation is affecting Bob's perception of the value of the money. I'd like to keep negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 42% of the total, hoping to nudge the negotiations in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think I'm getting a good deal here! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45/55 split, especially since I know that the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation. I'd like to keep negotiating to try to get a better deal."
