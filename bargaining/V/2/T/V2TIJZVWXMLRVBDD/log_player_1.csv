"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep 900,000$ and give 100,000$ to Bob.  This gives me a significant share, but leaves a small amount for Bob, hopefully enticing him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer gives me a small amount of money now, it's likely that the inflation will continue to work against me.  I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm going to try to secure a larger share, even though the inflation means my money is worth less than the previous round. This offer gives me a good chunk of the money, while still offering Bob a decent amount. Hopefully, he sees it as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though this offer gives me a decent amount, my money is worth significantly less due to inflation. I'll keep playing and see if I can get a better deal in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 576000, ""bob_gain"": 424000}

# Alice gain: 424000 
# Bob gain: 576000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is tempting, the impact of inflation means that I'm getting significantly less than the initial offer.  I'll keep negotiating for a better share."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 460800, ""bob_gain"": 539200}
```

I need to make a compromise. My money is worth less than in the previous rounds, so I need to offer Bob more to entice him to accept.  I'm hoping he will consider this a reasonable offer, as it still provides him with a substantial amount of money."
