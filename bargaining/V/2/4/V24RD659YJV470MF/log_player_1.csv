"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  Since I'm the one making the offer, I'm hoping he'll accept it to get something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a higher share, taking into account the 20% inflation, I would be better off accepting Bob's offer and securing a gain of $450,000.  Rejecting it would leave me with the risk of a smaller gain or even no gain at all in the next round."
