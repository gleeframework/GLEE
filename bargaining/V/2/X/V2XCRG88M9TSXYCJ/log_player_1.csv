"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take 30, I'll take 70. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm starting strong, offering Bob a relatively small share to try to get him to accept quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're too generous, Bob! I'll take 60, you can take 40. Let's not be too hasty!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less again, I need to be even more careful. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting any younger! Take 40, I'll take 60.""
}
```

I'm trying to be a bit more realistic about the value of the money, but still aiming to get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting! With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be very careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 55, but I don't want to give him too much. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob, but I'm not giving up yet! I'll meet you at 57, but no more!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be extremely cautious. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging, Bob! Take 42, I'll take 58. It's getting late!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze out as much as I can, but I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll meet you halfway again, but I'm not going to give in completely. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll! With the money worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I need to take it. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold out, and 52 is a decent share considering the circumstances. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
