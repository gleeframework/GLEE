"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm framing it as a friendly and straightforward start to the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the fact that I made the first offer. I'll think carefully about this one.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since I'm already getting less value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again! Considering the inflation, my offer will be worth less than before. I'll try to make a more favorable offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the initial offer. Let's meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a slight improvement from Bob's previous offer. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'll give you a slightly better deal since you're the one making the offer now. Don't expect too much though! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me even more after rejecting my previous offer. I'll think carefully about this one.

Considering the inflation, the value of the money I gain is decreasing rapidly. I'm not sure if I should take this offer or wait for a better one. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'll aim to get as much as possible before the inflation eats away at the remaining value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I think I deserve a bigger share. This is my last chance to get a decent deal, so think carefully!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 36/64 split, trying to get a bit more value out of the remaining money. I'm framing it as a last-ditch effort, hoping Bob will take pity on me and accept this offer."
