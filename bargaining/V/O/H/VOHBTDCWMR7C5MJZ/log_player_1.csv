"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but it's still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'd rather get a larger share now. I accept Bob's offer.
