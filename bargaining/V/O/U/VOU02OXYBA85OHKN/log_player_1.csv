"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining 200,000 in the next round""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take this offer and let's end the game quickly 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $400,000 I would gain in this round is actually worth 95% of the original $800,000 I could have gained in the first round, which is $760,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is 2:3, which is not very favorable to me. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money I gain is worth 90.25% of the original value, since it's 95% of 95% (5% inflation from round 1 and 5% from round 2).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Take this fair offer and let's end the game before it gets worse for you""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice is getting greedy, let's take it to the next round 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $450,000 I would gain in this round is actually worth 85.74% of the original $800,000 I could have gained in the first round, which is $685,920.

This offer is actually a better deal than my previous offer in round 3, considering the inflation. However, I'm not sure if I should accept it. The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is 0.818 (45,000/55,000), which is not very favorable to me.

I'll think about it...
