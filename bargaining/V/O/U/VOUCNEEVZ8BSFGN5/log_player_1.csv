I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I know Bob's money is worth less with each passing round.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even though the money is worth less for me now, the 50/50 split is a fair compromise. I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
