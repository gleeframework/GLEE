"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to take $550,000, leaving Bob with $450,000. I've attached a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to convey a sense of compromise and reasonableness, in the hopes that Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game quickly.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIn this response, I, Alice, have decided to reject Bob's offer. Although Bob has factored in the inflation and adjusted the split accordingly, I believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see what happens!\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to take $580,000, leaving Bob with $420,000. I've attached a message saying ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal"" to emphasize that I've taken into account the decreasing value of money for Bob and am willing to make a serious offer.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal""}\n\n###\n\nNote that I've increased my proposed share from the initial offer, taking into account that the money is still worth the same to me, while its value decreases for Bob. I'm trying to find a balance between being reasonable and taking advantage of the inflation mechanic."
