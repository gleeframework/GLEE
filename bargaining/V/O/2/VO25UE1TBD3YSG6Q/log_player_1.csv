"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more than you offered, but I'm going to need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a bigger share, but I don't want to risk going into more rounds. I'll accept the offer.
