"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gains are worth 5% less, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiation.

I'll accept Bob's offer. I'd rather get a guaranteed 45% of the remaining value than risk waiting for a better offer that might not materialize.
