"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you 40% and I'll take 60%""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me taking 60% since I'm taking a bigger risk by rejecting your offer. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to turn the tables on me!

However, I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced a 60/40 split is fair, especially with the inflation. Let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 55/45 and end this""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can finally end the game!"
