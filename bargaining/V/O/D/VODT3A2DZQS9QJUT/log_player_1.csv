"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, let's split it fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the total amount. I'm keeping $800,000, which is 80% of the total amount. My message to Bob is that I'm offering a fair share, but I'm not leaving him with a huge chunk of change."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous with your share, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so my gain of $300,000 is actually worth $285,000. I'm not happy with this offer, as I think I can do better than that. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm being more realistic about the inflation, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

In this offer, I'm keeping $550,000, which is 55% of the total amount, and offering Bob $450,000, which is 45% of the total amount. My message to Bob is that I'm being more realistic about the impact of inflation and trying to find a middle ground."
