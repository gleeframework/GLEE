Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice given the circumstances and the impact of inflation. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing significantly with each round. Waiting longer means accepting even less real value.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Alice's concessions are getting smaller. It's unlikely she'll drastically change her offer in Bob's favor.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds carries a significant risk of getting even less due to inflation. 

It's better to secure a less-than-ideal deal now (43 after inflation) than gamble on getting a marginally better offer later and potentially ending up with even less."
