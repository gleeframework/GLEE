"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60-40 in my favor, which means I'll get $60 and Bob will get $40. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair starting point for the division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll be getting $54 instead of $60.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about getting only $20. Since I'm not getting a fair share, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less again, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round, so I'll be getting $48.72 instead of $60.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fair split""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not getting any younger 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, so I'll be getting $43.68 instead of $60.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm still not thrilled about getting only $30. I think I can do better than that.
