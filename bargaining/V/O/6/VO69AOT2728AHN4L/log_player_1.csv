Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping to secure the money quickly and avoid inflation eating away at my share.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is still significantly more than I would get if we keep rejecting each other. I'll take the 5000$ and avoid risking further losses."
