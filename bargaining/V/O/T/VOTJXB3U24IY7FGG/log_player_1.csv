"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to set the tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 4:1, a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is now worth less, but I'm not too keen on Bob's 4:1 split. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too skewed towards you, Bob. I'd like to counter with a 7:3 split.""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better ratio in my favor, but I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 20% less than in the second round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less. My offer for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob. This is a fair split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, and I think this 7:3 split is a good middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth even less, and Bob's gain is also affected. I'm not thrilled about the 60:40 split, but I'm willing to consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take it. It's better than nothing, and I'm not getting any younger.""
}
```

I think I've been negotiating for long enough, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll take Bob's offer and call it a day."
