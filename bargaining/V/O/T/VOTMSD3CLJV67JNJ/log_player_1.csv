"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob's perception of the value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 5% less than the original $100, which is $95.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer considering the inflation. I'll accept it.
