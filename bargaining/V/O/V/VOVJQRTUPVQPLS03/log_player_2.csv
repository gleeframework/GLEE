"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, there's no reason to reject it. Accepting the offer ensures that I, Bob, receive half of the total amount, which is a fair and optimal outcome. Rejecting the offer would only lead to further negotiations and the risk of receiving less than half or even nothing if the negotiations break down. Accepting the offer guarantees a gain of $500,000, which is a good outcome."
