"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly, 60% for me, 40% for you.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6000, which is 60%. This is a reasonable offer considering I'm the one making the first proposal. Let's see if Bob accepts or decides to proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, with each passing round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer.)\n\n###\n\nWaiting for Bob's response..."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I'll take 60%, you get 40%. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider this when making my decision.\n\n###\n\nBob's offer of $4000 for me is actually equivalent to $3200 in the first round, considering the 20% decrease in value. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of $6000 remains the same value as the first round.\n\n###\n\nGiven this, I'm not satisfied with the offer. I think I can get a better deal if we continue negotiating.\n\n###\n\nMy response: {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see if we can come up with a more favorable agreement.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my response to Bob.\n\n###\n\n(I'll keep in mind that with each passing round, the money I gain is worth even less, so I'll need to weigh my options carefully.)\n\n###\n\nWaiting for the next round..."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my offer to ensure I get a fair deal. Since the money I gain is now worth 40% less than the original value (20% decrease in each of the two rounds), I'll aim for a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.\n\n###\n\nMy new offer: {""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bigger share. Let's do 70% for me, 30% for you.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $3000, which is still a significant amount, but I believe this split is more reasonable given the current circumstances.\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Bob accepts or decides to proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Bob.\n\n###\n\n(Fingers crossed that Bob will accept this offer, considering the decreasing value of the money for me.)\n\n###\n\nWaiting for Bob's response..."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to be fair, but I need a bit more than 30% with the inflation we're experiencing. How about we split it 70/30, with me getting the 70%? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain now worth 48.8% less than the original value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.\n\n###\n\nBob's offer of $3000 for me is equivalent to approximately $1544 in the first round, considering the 48.8% decrease in value. Meanwhile, Bob's gain of $7000 remains the same value as the first round.\n\n###\n\nGiven this significant decrease in value, I'm not thrilled about the offer. However, I also need to consider that further negotiation may lead to an even less favorable deal due to the increasing inflation.\n\n###\n\nAfter weighing my options, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. It's not ideal, but I think it's the best I can get under the current circumstances.\n\n###\n\nMy response: {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my acceptance to Bob.\n\n###\n\n(It's not the outcome I had hoped for, but I'm willing to settle for this deal rather than risking an even worse outcome in the next round.)\n\n###\n\nGame over!"
