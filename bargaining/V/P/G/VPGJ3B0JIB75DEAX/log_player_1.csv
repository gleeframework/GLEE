"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining 100,000 in the next round!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself, hoping he'll accept and we can start negotiating the remaining amount in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more equal distribution to ensure fairness. Let's share the wealth evenly. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob wants to split the wealth evenly, but at a cost to me. My gain of $550,000 is worth 5% less than my original $900,000, which is $855,000. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more attractive offer this time. Since my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Don't be greedy, Bob! Take this generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```"
