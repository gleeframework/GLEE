"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, but don't expect more!""
}
```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but you can do better! 
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I need to take that into account.

In the first round, I proposed 900,000 for myself and 100,000 for Bob. Now, Bob is proposing 800,000 for me, which is worth the same as 900,000 in the first round, and 200,000 for himself, which is worth 10% less than 100,000.

I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's offer:

800,000 (my gain) = 900,000 (first round value)
200,000 (Bob's gain) = 0.9 * 100,000 (first round value) = 90,000

So, Bob's offer is actually a 10% decrease in value from the first round, but I'm getting the same amount in terms of purchasing power.

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.
