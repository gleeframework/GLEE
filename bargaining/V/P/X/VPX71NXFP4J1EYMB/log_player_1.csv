"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% and take 60%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me taking the larger share. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get something instead of risking going to Round 2 and facing the 5% inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I can do better next round. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less now, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $50
* Bob gain: $50

I'm not thrilled about meeting in the middle, but I don't want to risk going to Round 3 with even less value. I'll accept this offer to get $50. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
