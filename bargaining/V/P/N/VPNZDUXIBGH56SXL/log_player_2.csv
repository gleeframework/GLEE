# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the 20% decrease in value for Alice, I might be able to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for Alice. Since Alice's share will be worth 20% less, I can try to negotiate a better deal.

{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer deal for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for me. Let's settle this now with a deal that still gives you a good share. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the decreasing value of money for Alice, I think I can still negotiate a better deal. Since Alice's share is now worth 36% less, she might be willing to compromise further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","With Alice's share now worth 36% less, I'll try to negotiate an even better deal.

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Given the current inflation, I believe this offer is more than fair for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Take this offer before inflation eats up my entire share! 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant decrease in value for Alice's share, which is now worth 59.04% less, I think this offer is quite favorable for me. It seems unlikely that Alice would reject a further offer that would give me an even larger share, given the rapidly diminishing value of her potential gain.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take this deal!"
