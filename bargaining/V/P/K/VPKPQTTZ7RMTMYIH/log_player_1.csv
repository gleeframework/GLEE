```

  ""alice_gain"": 70,

}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my initial proposal would have been 63 and 37, but that's not on the table now.

I'll consider Bob's new offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too generous, Bob. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Still a bit too generous, Bob. I think I can do better than that.""
