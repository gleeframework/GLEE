"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair, considering the inflation we'll both face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $450,000 is actually equivalent to $360,000 in the first round. Considering this, I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to get a better deal. My decision is:\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet me know how Bob responds!"

Here's my proposal:\n{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more generous offer. Let's settle!""}\n\nLet me know how Bob responds!"
