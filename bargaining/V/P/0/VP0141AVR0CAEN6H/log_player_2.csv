Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 990,000 and you can have 10,000.  This is just to start the conversation, let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit harsh, don't you think? Let's be reasonable. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor.  This reflects the risk I'm taking by letting inflation eat at my potential gains.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your perspective on inflation. I'm willing to budge a bit, but a 65/35 split is still too much. I propose a 40/60 split,  with you taking 600,000 and me taking 400,000. This is a more balanced approach,  and I believe it's fair given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000
