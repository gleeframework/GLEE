350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit harsh, don't you think? Let's be reasonable. I propose a 65/35 split in my favor.  This reflects the risk I'm taking by letting inflation eat at my potential gains.",Bob,2,

400000.0,600000.0,"Bob,  I understand your perspective on inflation. I'm willing to budge a bit, but a 65/35 split is still too much. I propose a 40/60 split,  with you taking 600,000 and me taking 400,000. This is a more balanced approach,  and I believe it's fair given the circumstances.",Alice,3,
