"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds.  Each round that passes, the money is worth significantly less to Alice than it is to me. I should aim for a much larger share by the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a better deal than last round, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm flipping the script from Alice's offer but offering a slightly better deal to make it tempting. This sets a precedent of me increasing my demand.  It's still early, so I'm not going too extreme yet, but I want to highlight the impact of inflation on my decision-making."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit less, but still need a larger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly moving in my direction, but it's not enough.  The significant inflation working against her means I have a strong position to bargain from.  I need to signal I'm willing to play this out for a few more rounds to get a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""The clock is ticking, and the value is diminishing. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my demand again, but keeping the increase smaller this time. This shows I'm serious about getting a larger share but am willing to negotiate. The message emphasizes the time pressure and the fact that every round hurts Alice more than me. This might push her to accept a less favorable deal now rather than risk getting even less later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice is right about time running out, her idea of ""the middle"" still heavily favors her in terms of the actual present value of the money. The inflation is working strongly in my favor, and I need to capitalize on that.  A 50/50 split now would be a bad deal for me considering the losses she's facing each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to the wire. This offer is more than generous considering how much value is lost each round. Let's be realistic and close this out.""} 
```

**Reasoning:** I'm increasing my demand again, but only slightly.  This shows persistence and emphasizes that I understand the game's dynamics better than Alice seems to. My message is direct and emphasizes the urgency of the situation.  While I'm pushing for a very favorable split, there's a chance Alice might panic as the rounds run out and accept, especially since getting to round 12 means getting $0."
