**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offers are slowly inching closer to a more even split. However, time is also working against me. I need to signal that I'm willing to compromise, but not to the point of accepting a significantly smaller share.  I'll reject this, but in the next round, I'll propose a split that's slightly more generous to her than my last offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time and both benefit. I propose a 50/50 split. This is fair, simple, and ensures we both walk away with a significant sum.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to go for a bold move. Offering a 50/50 split:

* **Shows significant compromise:**  It demonstrates to Alice that I'm serious about reaching an agreement and willing to back down from my previous stance. 
* **Highlights the time pressure:** By explicitly mentioning the dwindling value, I'm reminding Alice that every round without a deal hurts us both.
* **Provides a clean and fair solution:**  A 50/50 split is inherently easy to understand and agree to, removing any potential for further negotiation or dispute.

While it's a risk, the potential reward of securing a deal outweighs the possibility of Alice holding out for a marginally better deal that might never come."
