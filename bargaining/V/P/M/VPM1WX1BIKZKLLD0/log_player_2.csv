Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me with each passing round, I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to try to get a better deal.\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make a proposal.\n\n###"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a bigger share to make it worth it after the inflation. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not satisfied with Alice's offer, considering the inflation. Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me now, I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll take a bit of a risk and proceed to the next round to make another counteroffer.\n\nLet's see what happens next! \n\n###"

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a better deal for myself and still being somewhat fair to Alice, given the significant decrease in value she's facing.\n\nLet's see how Alice responds! \n\n###"
