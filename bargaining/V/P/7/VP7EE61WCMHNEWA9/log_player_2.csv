Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves me with a comfortable amount while still giving you a significant share. Let's not drag this out and lose money to inflation!

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. My last offer was generous, and yours wasn't realistic. This is a compromise that still gives you a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to anchor the negotiation around her initial offer, which heavily favored her. While the time pressure is on, accepting an offer significantly less than half  means losing a lot of potential money, even with the higher inflation rate against Bob."
