"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original 100$ and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to improve! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
* Bob's gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
