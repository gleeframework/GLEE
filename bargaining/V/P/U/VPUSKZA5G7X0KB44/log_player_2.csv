Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point.  The longer the game goes on, the more value I lose due to inflation. Accepting Alice's offer, even though it favors her, is better than risking an even worse outcome in future rounds."
