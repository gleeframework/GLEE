"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A reasonable offer for you to take considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal considering the inflation will hurt me more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation will impact me more in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your offer is only slightly better for me than your previous one. I'm willing to settle for a bit less, but you need to meet me closer to the middle. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is less than my previous one, the inflation will hurt me even more in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, even though it's less than I hoped for."
