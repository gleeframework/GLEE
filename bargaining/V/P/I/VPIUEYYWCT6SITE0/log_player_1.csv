"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a high gain for myself, but I'll leave a small share for Bob in hopes that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, the inflation is a real risk.  Taking the $10 now is better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
