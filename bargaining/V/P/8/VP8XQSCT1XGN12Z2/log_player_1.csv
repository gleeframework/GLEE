"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 with a 75/25 split. This offers a good balance between fairness and practicality, considering the risk of inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split considering the risk of inflation. It's a fair deal and I'm willing to take a smaller share to ensure we reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
