"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it. Since the offer is equal, it's a fair split, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, the inflation is eating into my potential gains, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
