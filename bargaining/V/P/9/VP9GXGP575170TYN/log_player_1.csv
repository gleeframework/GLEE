"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as I think this is a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I want 6000 for myself. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not sure I want to give Bob a larger share than me, especially since the money is worth 20% less for him now. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a reasonable compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to stay firm on my share, but offering Bob a slightly smaller amount to see if he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. It's my turn to make a better offer. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to inch his way up. I'll think about it...

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a larger share, but I do want to make progress. I'll accept this offer, as it's a slight improvement from my previous offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
