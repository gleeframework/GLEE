"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you halfway, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate. However, splitting it evenly is a reasonable compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly larger share to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""A bit more for me to account for inflation?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept this compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting less, I'm getting more, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split in favor of Bob. However, I don't want to reject this offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. I'll accept this compromise, hoping that the value of the money will stabilize or increase in the future.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 40% share and hope for the best!"
