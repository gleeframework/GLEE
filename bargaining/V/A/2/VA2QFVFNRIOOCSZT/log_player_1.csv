"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair deal. This considers the time-value of money. 
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because, although he has taken into account the time-value of money, I believe his proposed division is not fair. He is offering me 360,000 dollars, which is less than what I offered him in the previous round, considering the inflation factor. I think I can get a better deal if we continue playing. I will make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 432000, ""bob_gain"": 568000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a better deal for both""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I am offering Bob 568,000 dollars, which is slightly less than what he offered himself in the previous round, but still a significant amount. I will take 432,000 dollars, which is more than what Bob offered me in the previous round, considering the inflation factor. I believe this is a fair offer, taking into account the decreasing value of money. I hope Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer. If he rejects it, I will wait for his counteroffer."
