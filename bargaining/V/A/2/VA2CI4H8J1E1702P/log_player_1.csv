"Round 1

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm still offering a larger share, but adjusting to account for the inflation and Bob's previous offer. I believe this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a terrible offer. Although I am losing value due to inflation, the decrease in value is still smaller for me than it is for Bob. This offer is a huge step back from the previous round, and I am still confident I can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I am adjusting my offer again to account for the inflation and Bob's unwillingness to compromise. This offer still favors me but acknowledges the rapidly shrinking value of the money. I hope we can reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is still very bad. While I'm facing significant inflation, Bob is losing value much faster. He's still offering a grossly disproportionate split in his favor. I need to hold out for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 656100, ""bob_gain"": 343900}
```

I'm continuing to adjust my offer downwards, but I'm still offering a larger share.  The inflation is really hurting Bob at this point, and I believe he'll need to compromise soon to avoid getting nothing at all."
