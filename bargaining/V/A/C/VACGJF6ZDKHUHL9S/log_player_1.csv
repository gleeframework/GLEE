"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's keep the conversation going. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. However, I don't want to give away too much.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and proposing a counteroffer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer or make a counteroffer!"
