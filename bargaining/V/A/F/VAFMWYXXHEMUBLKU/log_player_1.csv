"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer gives me a majority of the money, but also ensures Bob receives a reasonable amount. I believe it's a fair starting point, and I'm curious to see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take more money, even though my share is already significantly reduced due to inflation. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the expense of my own financial well-being."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}
```

I'm willing to compromise slightly to avoid further rounds of negotiation.  This offer still gives me a larger share, but acknowledges Bob's desire for more.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a difficult decision.  While my share is much smaller than what I initially wanted, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I'd gain if I keep rejecting offers.  It's better to accept this offer and secure some money than risk getting nothing in a later round."
