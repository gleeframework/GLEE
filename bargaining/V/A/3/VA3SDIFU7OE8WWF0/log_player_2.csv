Let's see if we can get a better deal!"

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to flip the script and see if Alice will accept a deal where she gets less.  I'm taking a bit of a risk since I don't know how the inflation is affecting her, but I think it's worth a shot."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is a significant improvement over the last round.  While I'm getting 100,000 less than I initially proposed, the inflation has made this a good deal.  It's better to secure 500,000 than risk getting nothing by continuing to play."
