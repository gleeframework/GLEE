Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is ticking and the value is decreasing rapidly, especially for you. I'm proposing a deal where we both get a decent amount while considering the shrinking pot. This is a fair offer given the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about the time pressure (especially for me with the higher inflation rate), her offer is getting worse.  It's important to show I'm not going to just accept a bad deal as the rounds progress. I need to push for a more favorable outcome while keeping the shrinking pot in mind."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'm proposing a compromise that leans a bit more towards my side, acknowledging that your losses are greater with each round.  Let's seal this deal now and avoid walking away with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Time pressure is becoming critical.  While the offer is not ideal, it's better to get something than risk losing everything if we run out of rounds. Accepting now avoids further losses from inflation, which is significantly impacting my potential gains."
