"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward division. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, but you'll have to take it 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the numbers are:

* Alice gain: 300,000 x 0.8 = 240,000
* Bob gain: 700,000 x 0.8 = 560,000

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much, considering the inflation is still affecting the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the adjusted values considering the 48.8% inflation:

* Alice gain: 350,000 x 0.5162 (1 - 0.4838) = 180,372
* Bob gain: 650,000 x 0.5162 = 334,730

Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I think this is a relatively fair offer, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer.
