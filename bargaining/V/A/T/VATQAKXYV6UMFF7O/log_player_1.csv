"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll get $6,000 and Bob will get $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you halfway, let's see if we can agree on this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I'm willing to compromise. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm willing to accept this offer.
