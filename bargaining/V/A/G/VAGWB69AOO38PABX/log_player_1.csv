"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90:10 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'm actually gaining 45$ (50 * 0.9) and Bob is gaining 50$. This is a more even split than my initial offer, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept Bob's offer.
