"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but Bob still gets a decent amount to make the game worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair one. However, considering the inflation, I'd rather get more money now than risk waiting for a better offer later. I accept this offer.
