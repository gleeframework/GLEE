"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  Inflation hurts you more than me.  This offer still gives you a sizable amount, and it's in your best interest to accept before it shrinks further. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that inflation hurts me more, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. Holding out for a better deal is risky, but I'm willing to gamble that she'll be more reasonable in the next round, especially as the value of the money continues to decrease."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I've proposed a fair deal, and yet you keep trying to lowball me. Let's just split it evenly and be done with it. This offer is the most rational choice considering the impact of inflation on both of us.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Going for a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point.  Here's why:

* **Fairness:**  It removes any argument about one person getting a better deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  Each round sees the value of the money decrease. A quick resolution is in both players' best interests.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:**  She's rejected offers that were already generous to her. This indicates a 50/50 split might be the only way to reach an agreement."
