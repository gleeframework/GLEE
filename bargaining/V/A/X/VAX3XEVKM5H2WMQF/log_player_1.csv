"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This means I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, I'll decide based on the relative values of the money.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather get a larger share of the reduced amount. I'll reject the offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share of the reduced amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less and less with each round, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining amount. However, Bob's offer is actually giving him a slightly larger share than in the previous round.

In this case, I'll accept the offer, as it's the best option given the current situation.
