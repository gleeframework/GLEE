"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a bit generous, but I'll think about it... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a more balanced split. Here's my proposal for round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
