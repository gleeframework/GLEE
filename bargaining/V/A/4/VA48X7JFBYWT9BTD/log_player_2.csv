Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting closer to a more even split, time is running out.  Alice is likely aware of the pressure on Bob due to inflation and may be trying to wait him out for an even better deal.  Bob needs to hold firm and try for a more favorable outcome in the next round or two."
