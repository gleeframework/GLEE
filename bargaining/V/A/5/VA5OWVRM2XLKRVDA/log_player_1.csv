Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a very small amount.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal where I get the vast majority of the money.  I figure if he's being greedy, he might reject this offer and risk losing even more money due to inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round. Accepting 500,000 is better than risking getting nothing due to inflation."
