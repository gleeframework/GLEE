"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering to give Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth less each round, I'd like to get a bigger share now. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob. I'll make a new offer, trying to get a larger share:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! In Round 4, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth significantly less for me, I'd like to get a bigger share now. However, I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get. I'll accept this offer.
