"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer represents a fair division considering the diminishing value of money with each round. Please consider it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's proposal seems fair at first glance, I'm going to reject it. My goal is to maximize my gains, and with the diminishing value of money, waiting for my turn to propose could potentially yield a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I believe this is a fair offer, considering the diminishing value of money. I am willing to negotiate further if you have any concerns.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose an equal division of the remaining amount. This ensures both of us receive a fair share despite the decreasing value of money. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting the offer in this round is the best strategy for maximizing my potential gains.  The money I gain is worth significantly less now due to inflation.  Furthermore, there is a good chance that Alice will reject my proposal in the next round, leaving me with a smaller share.  An equal division is a fair compromise that secures a substantial amount for me."
