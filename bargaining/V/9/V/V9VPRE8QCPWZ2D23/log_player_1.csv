"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 4:1 split is a bit too generous to you. Let's try a more balanced 8:2 split. This will be a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't like the 8:2 split. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:2 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
