"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering inflation, I propose a split of 47.5 for me and 52.5 for you. This accounts for potential loss of value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 52.5 
# Bob gain: 47.5 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
