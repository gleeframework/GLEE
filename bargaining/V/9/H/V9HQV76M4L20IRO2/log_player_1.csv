"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start by offering a fairly generous split in my favor.  I want to see how Bob reacts to this offer, and if he's willing to accept a smaller share.  Let's see how this plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation.  It's better to take the 50% now rather than risk getting less in the next round.  Let's finish this game!"
