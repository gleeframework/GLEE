I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept and we can both get something.  Since we have 12 rounds, I'm not too worried about inflation yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's only 10% of the money, and while it's a small amount, I can probably get a better deal with the remaining rounds.  The inflation might affect me, but I'm still hoping to get more than just 10%."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still trying to keep most of the money for myself. The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal than Bob's last offer."
