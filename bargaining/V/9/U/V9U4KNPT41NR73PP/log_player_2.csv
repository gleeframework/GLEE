Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm offering Alice a small share, hoping she'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1900 
# Alice gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer guarantees me some money, which is better than risking nothing."
