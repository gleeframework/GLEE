**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage, but her offers are getting worse for her due to inflation.  We're past the halfway point, and she'll have to get serious soon. Holding out for a better offer is still the best strategy, even if it means taking a slight loss compared to a 50/50 split in earlier rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This is my final offer before I start asking for more than half.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point. Alice needs to understand the time pressure and the fact that her position weakens with each round.
* **Slight Concession:** Offering 480,000 is a small concession that might make Alice feel like she's getting a small win.
* **Strong Stance:** The message is firm but not aggressive. It sets a clear expectation for the upcoming rounds and puts the pressure back on Alice."
