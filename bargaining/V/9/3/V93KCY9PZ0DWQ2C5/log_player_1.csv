"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's split it 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, the total amount is still $100, but it's worth 80% of its original value.

Bob's offer is to split it 50/50, which means I would get $50, and Bob would get $50. However, considering the inflation, $50 is worth 40% of the original $50 (since it's 80% of the original amount, and I'm getting 50% of that).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as I'm getting less than I would have gotten in the previous round. I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%). I'll make a new offer to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 64,
  ""bob_gain"": 36,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm keeping $64 and giving Bob $36."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise to move forward. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money I gain is worth 40.8% of its original value (80% of 64% of 80% of 100%). Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting $40, which is worth 32% of the original $40 (40.8% of 40% of 80% of 100%).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as I'm getting less than I would have gotten in the previous round. However, I'm also considering the fact that the game is getting more difficult due to the increasing inflation.
