Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be fair and split it evenly. This is getting ridiculous.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a little more, but I'm not going down to 50 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly refusing to offer a fair deal, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly for me with each round. I need to hold firm and continue pushing for a more equitable split. It's risky, but waiting another round might force her hand, especially since she's unlikely to get a better deal later."

Round 6

{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  Take it or I'm walking away.""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I'll give you one more chance 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The game has reached a critical point.  While 44 is far from ideal, rejecting this offer brings significant risk:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The 10% inflation is rapidly eroding my potential gains. Every round I wait, the value shrinks, making even a slightly worse offer in the future potentially worse than accepting now.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has shown herself to be a tough negotiator, unwilling to budge much. There's no guarantee she'll offer anything better, and a bad offer in later rounds could leave me with a truly terrible deal. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting now secures something rather than risking getting almost nothing if the game fails."
