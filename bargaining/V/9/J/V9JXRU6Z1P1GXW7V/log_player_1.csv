"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. With the inflation, my gain of $3000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease. On the other hand, Bob's gain of $7000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is a smaller decrease.

I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that gives me less than half of the original amount, but I also don't want to risk going into further rounds and potentially losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see what happens next.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation in mind, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount to compensate for the decreased value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a fair cut!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'll still give you a small chance to get something 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation. My gain of $2000 is worth a mere 20% of what it was in the first round, which is a significant decrease. Bob's gain of $8000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is still a substantial amount.

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'm not sure if I can afford to be picky. I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
