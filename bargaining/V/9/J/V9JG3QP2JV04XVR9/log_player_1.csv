Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to see how Bob reacts. Let's see if we can secure a good deal early on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more favorable split, accepting this offer secures me a decent amount of money, and I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to wait with the inflation rate increasing."
