"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a more even split, 55% for me and 45% for you.  Let's avoid going back and forth and get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
