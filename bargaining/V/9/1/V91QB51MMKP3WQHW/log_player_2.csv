"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, Bob. A little extra for me to start since the value decreases faster for you. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly, Alice. We both have to worry about the diminishing value of the money, so I think a 50/50 split makes the most sense for both of us.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle a bit. I understand your concerns about the decreasing value, but it impacts me more. This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""I still think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go.  It's clear we're not going to agree on anything else, and the money is only going to continue to lose value.  Let's be rational and split it evenly.""}
