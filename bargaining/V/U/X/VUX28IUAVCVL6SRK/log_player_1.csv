Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9000 for myself and give Bob $1000. This leaves a lot of room for negotiation and allows for a fair outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to try and split the difference with Bob's previous offer while still accounting for the inflation. I'm offering him 1500, hoping he sees the value in that, as the money is worth less for me with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, trying to strike a balance between what I need and what I think Bob might accept.  Each round the value is decreasing for me, so I need to make sure I get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground while acknowledging the decreasing value of my share. I'm offering Bob 2500, which is more than his previous offer, but still leaves me with a reasonable amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's more than my previous offer, I'm hoping to get more than $2500, especially with the inflation."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but this time by a smaller amount. I need to get something substantial, and I'm hoping Bob will see that we're getting closer to a reasonable compromise."
