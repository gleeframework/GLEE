"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept a relatively low amount to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate. However, Bob's offer is still a relatively good one, and I don't want to risk going into another round.
