"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, considering the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","After considering Bob's proposal, I decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 55/45 split, especially considering that the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Your turn again!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 480,000$ and keeping 520,000$ for myself, trying to find a more balanced split."
