I'm going for a very lopsided split in my favor.  Since the money is worth less to Bob with each round, I'm hoping he'll accept even a tiny amount to avoid losing more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I know Bob's offer is much better than my previous one, but I'm going to reject it.  He's being greedy, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round.  I'll be the one making the offer then, and I'll use my knowledge of his aversion to inflation to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm still going for a large share, but I've increased Bob's share to 100,000 to make it more appealing. I know that he's losing value on his money with each round, so I'm hoping that he'll accept this offer before he loses even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting much better for me, and his share is getting smaller due to inflation. I don't want to risk another round and end up with even less.  I'll accept this offer."
