"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a good deal, but don't expect me to go easy on you.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm going to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's actually $270,000.

I'm not happy with this offer, as I was hoping for a better deal. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive in my next offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting off that easy! Meet me in the middle, but I'm not going to give you the better deal.""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more than I did in the first round, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing it, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my gains! With the 27.1% decrease, my gain of $450,000 is now worth only about $327,900.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal next round. I'll accept it, hoping that the inflation will be more severe in the next round.
