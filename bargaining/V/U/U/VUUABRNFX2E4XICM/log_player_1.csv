"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking on the risk of Bob rejecting this offer and potentially ending up with less in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation factor. Accepting this will secure me a significant portion of the money, and the risk of further inflation and potential further losses in future rounds outweighs the desire for a slightly larger gain."
