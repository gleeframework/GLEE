"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm tempted to accept the offer. However, I'm not sure if I should settle for $5,000 when I could potentially get more.

I'll reject the offer and proceed to Round 3.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's offer again...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not as concerned about the value of my share. However, Bob's share is significantly higher than mine, which makes me wonder if I'm getting a fair deal.

After careful consideration, I'll accept Bob's offer.
