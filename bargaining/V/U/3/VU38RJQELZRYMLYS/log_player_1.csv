"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000 and taking $6000 for myself, with a message that suggests this is a fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you value fairness, but my offer in this round considers the decreasing value of the money over time. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. I'm not willing to settle for $4500, which is worth even less due to inflation. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is the best I can offer""}\n\nI'm making a new offer, taking into account the inflation that's affecting the value of the money for me. I'm offering Bob $4200 and taking $5800 for myself, which I believe is a reasonable split given the circumstances. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. The value of the reward diminishes significantly with each round. This offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. Given that the money is now worth 48.8% less to me than in the first round, I think accepting $4900 is a better option than risking another round and potentially losing even more value. It's time to settle and make the most of what I can get!"
