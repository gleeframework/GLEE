"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the inflation rates, I think I can get a better deal."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but the split needs to reflect the faster inflation I'm facing. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take my chances and try to get a better deal, despite Alice's claim that this is her final offer. The inflation is indeed affecting her more, but I think there's still room for negotiation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""I understand your concerns about inflation, but I'm also losing value with each round. This is a fair compromise, considering we both have less to gain now.""}"
