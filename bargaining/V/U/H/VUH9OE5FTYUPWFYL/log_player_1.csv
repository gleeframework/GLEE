"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's end this quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair deal considering the inflation rate. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and meeting halfway is a fair compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
