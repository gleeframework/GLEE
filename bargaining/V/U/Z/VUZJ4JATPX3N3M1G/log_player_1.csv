"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, my friend!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a generous share, and keeping $70 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, given that we both have an equal chance of getting to propose in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I think I can do better than 40% of the remaining value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You were generous in round 2, now it's my turn to be fair""
