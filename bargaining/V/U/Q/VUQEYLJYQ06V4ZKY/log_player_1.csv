"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair and square, 60-40 split""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll consider the offer in terms of the reduced value. If I accept this offer, I'll get 20 dollars, which is equivalent to 18 dollars in the original value (since it's 10% less). Meanwhile, Bob will get 80 dollars, which is equivalent to 64 dollars in the original value (since it's 20% less).

Considering the reduced value, I think this offer is a bit too skewed towards Bob. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 split""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both 50 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, the inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings!

Considering the reduced value, I'll think carefully about this offer. If I accept this offer, I'll get 10 dollars, which is equivalent to 6.9 dollars in the original value (since it's 27.1% less). Meanwhile, Bob will get 90 dollars, which is equivalent to 52.2 dollars in the original value (since it's 48.8% less).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm getting desperate too. I think I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more generous in the next round.
