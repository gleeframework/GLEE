Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,

}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $700,000 and Bob receives $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that in my decision.

The offer is that I receive $500,000, which is worth 90% of $700,000, and Bob receives $500,000, which is the same as before.

I'll decide to reject this offer.
