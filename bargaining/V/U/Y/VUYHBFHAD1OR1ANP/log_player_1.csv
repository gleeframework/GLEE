"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I'm not as enthusiastic about the 45-55 split. I'll try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52
}"
