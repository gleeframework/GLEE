"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep 900,000$ for myself and give 100,000$ to Bob.  This way, we both get a decent amount, and I get the majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'll offer 600,000$ for myself and 400,000$ for Bob. This way, we both get a reasonable share, and I still get the larger portion while taking into account the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, this offer is still a good deal for me. I would have received a smaller share in the previous round, and there's no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything in the next round."
