"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40?""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the inflation rates. This way, Bob will have an incentive to accept the offer and end the game early, rather than risking further inflation. The message ""Let's be fair, 60-40?"" is a friendly and reasonable-sounding way to present the offer.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, given the current circumstances. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal than 45% of the original amount. Since Bob is more affected by inflation, I'll try to use this to my advantage and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What will Bob do next?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 575000, ""bob_gain"": 425000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 42.5% of the money, which is a compromise between my initial offer of 40% and Bob's offer of 45%. The message ""Meet me in the middle?"" suggests that I'm willing to find a mutually acceptable solution, while still trying to get a slightly better deal. Given the inflation rates, I believe this offer is still relatively generous, and Bob might be willing to accept it to avoid further losses.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! What will Bob decide?"
