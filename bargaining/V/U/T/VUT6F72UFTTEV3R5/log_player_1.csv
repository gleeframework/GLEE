"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have the rest. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer. I was hoping for a more even split, and giving me only 40% of the total is not acceptable. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal!""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, where I'll take a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it, it's worth less anyway. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with this offer at all. The fact that the money is worth less due to inflation doesn't justify Bob taking 70% of the total. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not too much, since the money's value is dropping""}

I'm proposing a 58-42 split, where I'll give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keep a decent amount for myself."
