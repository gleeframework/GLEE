Let me recalculate the actual values considering the new inflation rates:

* My gain in Round 1 was 80$, which is now worth 80 * 0.5162 (1 - 0.4838) = 41.296, but since the money is now worth 48.8% less than in Round 1, my gain is actually 41.296 / 0.5162 ≈ 80.0 * 0.5162 / 0.5162 = 80 * 0.5162 / 0.5162 = 41.296, however my gain in round 3 was 64, so my gain in round 4 is 64 * 0.5162 = 33.0112. 
* Bob's gain in Round 1 was 20$, which is now worth 20 * 0.8594 = 17.188, but since the money is now worth 14.26% less than in Round 1, Bob's gain is actually 17.188 / 0.8594 ≈ 20.0 * 0.8594 / 0.8594 = 17.188.

Considering the actual values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll try to negotiate further.""
