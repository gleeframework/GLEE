I'm starting with a pretty generous offer. Hopefully, Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to accept this offer. The inflation will only continue to eat away at my potential gains, and there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the future. It's a fair split, and securing half is a good outcome."
