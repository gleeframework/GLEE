"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping you'll accept this generous offer!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original 100$ (80$) and Bob will get 20% (20$)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly.  It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain as 50 * 0.9 = 45.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with an even split. I'd like to try to negotiate for a bit more.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will make a new offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation again, my gain will be 45 * 0.9 = 40.5.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not sure I want to give up too much. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
