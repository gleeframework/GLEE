"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a pretty generous offer, considering the inflation risk. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much less favorable than my initial proposal, and with inflation, my potential gains have decreased. I'm not willing to settle for such a low share. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split in my favor. While inflation has affected my potential earnings, I'm still confident I can secure a more favorable deal than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his last one, it's still significantly lower than my initial proposal, and the inflation has severely diminished my potential gains. I'm not willing to accept this offer. I'll take my chances with the next round, hoping to secure a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

Despite the continued inflation, I'm sticking to my strategy of offering a relatively generous split, aiming for a quick resolution.  This 70/30 split is still better than the previous offers, and hopefully, it will be enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is much more equitable than the previous offers. Although the inflation has significantly reduced my potential gains, accepting this offer ensures I get at least something.  I'm willing to compromise at this point to avoid further risk of losing even more money."
