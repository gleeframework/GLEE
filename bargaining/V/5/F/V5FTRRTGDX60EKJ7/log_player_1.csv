I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  I'm hoping this is enough to secure an agreement in the first round, avoiding the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the $100,000,  I know that if I reject it, the money will be worth less to Bob in the next round.  I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
``` 

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This feels like a fair compromise, especially considering the inflation we've both experienced."
