"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to get a bit more to compensate for the loss. However, I don't want to give up too much, or I might regret it later.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a fair share considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get impatient. I think I deserve more than half, considering the risks I'm taking. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob more than half. I'll think carefully about it.

However, since the money is worth significantly less now, I'll consider the offer more favorably. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
