I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  This gives me a large share, while still offering Bob something.  Since I have the first offer, I want to be as aggressive as possible while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it might seem like a good deal on the surface, remember inflation has hit Bob much harder. He's offering me a much smaller percentage, and the value of that percentage is decreased by 5%.  I'm better off holding out for a better deal, especially since I'll be making the offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer to 80/20. I need to account for the inflation that's making my share worth less, but I'm still confident I can secure a good deal. I'm hoping Bob realizes that if we continue this pattern, the value of his share will keep decreasing significantly with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it might seem appealing at first glance, Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation hitting me harder. Even with the inflation factored in, this offer is way too lopsided in his favor. I'm going to hold out for a fairer deal, even if it means more rounds of negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer a 70/30 split.  This is still a significant share for me, but I need to keep lowering my offer to account for inflation. I'm also hoping Bob will recognize that continuing to reject offers will only hurt him more in the long run. He's already lost a considerable amount of potential value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is much closer to what I'd like to see, and I'm recognizing that the longer we go, the more inflation will hurt me.  This offer is still significantly better than Bob's previous one, and while I could hold out for more, the risk of further inflation is too great."
