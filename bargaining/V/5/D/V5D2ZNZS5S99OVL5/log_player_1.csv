"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a generous offer considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take something rather than nothing, the inflation rate means this offer is worth significantly less than the 900,000 I proposed. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm proposing an 81/19 split in my favor.  This is a compromise given the inflation, but still leaves me with a good portion of the money. Let's see if Bob is more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's tempting to take something, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of this offer. I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}
```

I'm proposing a 72.9/27.1 split in my favor.  This offer reflects the ongoing inflation, but I'm still aiming for a substantial portion of the money.  Let's see if Bob is finally willing to negotiate."
