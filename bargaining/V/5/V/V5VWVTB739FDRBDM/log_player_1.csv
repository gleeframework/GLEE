"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```
This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less now. My gain of 450,000 is worth 90% of the original 600,000 I proposed, which is 540,000. Bob's gain of 550,000 is worth 95% of the original 400,000, which is 530,000.

Considering the inflation adjustment, Bob's offer is actually more favorable to me than my original proposal. I accept this offer.
