I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point,  as I'm taking the risk of being rejected and having to negotiate further."

# Alice gain: 400000

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe I should get a larger share of the money.  I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

This offer is better than my last offer and while I am still losing money, I'm worried about the inflation continuing. I'll take it."
