{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 70-30, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller lead, 55-45. Let's compromise!""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to get a bit more than the initial 60-40 offer I made earlier."

# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is worth even less for me now! But I'll still consider Bob's offer. Since the 65-35 split is closer to the 70-30 he proposed earlier, I'll think about it...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger push for a better split. Considering the money is worth less for me, I'll aim for a more aggressive split:

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, trying to get a fair deal despite the decreasing value of the money."
