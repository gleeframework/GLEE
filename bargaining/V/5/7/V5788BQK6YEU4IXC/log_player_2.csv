Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Middle ground, considering the time pressure 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to the middle, time is pressing more heavily on her.  Each round makes the money less valuable to her, and she's losing value faster than I am.  I believe I can hold out for a slightly better deal still."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both get something.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

By round 6, the inflation is significantly impacting both players. Offering a 50/50 split, even though it favors Alice in terms of the original value, is the safest bet.  It reflects a clear compromise, and the longer the negotiation goes, the less either of us will get. This emphasizes fairness and the urgency of the situation."
