"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on, before inflation starts to eat away at its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still offering a fairly unequal split, even with the inflation considered. I'm going to reject and try to negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to lower my initial demand slightly to 85/15.  While I'm still aiming for a larger share, I need to be more realistic and account for inflation. This offer is still generous considering the decreased value of the money, and I believe it's in Bob's best interest to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is starting to hit hard, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal than this. Bob is still offering a significant portion of the money, and I'm willing to take it."
