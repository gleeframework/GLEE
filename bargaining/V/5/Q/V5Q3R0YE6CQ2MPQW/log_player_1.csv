"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a slight edge, but still leaving you with a good portion. Accept and let's move on. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, his gain of $600,000 is actually equivalent to $480,000 in the first round's value. That's a significant advantage for him.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Still a fair split, Bob, but I'm taking a slightly larger share this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving me a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount of money."
