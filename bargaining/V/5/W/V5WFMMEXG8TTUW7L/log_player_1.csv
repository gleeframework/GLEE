"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer is a bit of a gamble. It's a fair split, but Bob might want more since his money loses value at a slower rate. Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd ideally prefer a higher share, it's important to consider the inflation. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me some money, and the inflation will further decrease the value of my potential earnings in future rounds."
