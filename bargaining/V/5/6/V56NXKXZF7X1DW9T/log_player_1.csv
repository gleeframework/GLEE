"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a very small portion of the money.  Since the money is worth less to Bob in each round, I'm hoping he'll accept this early offer rather than risk getting less in a later round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, it's likely Bob will continue to offer a 50/50 split in future rounds.  Since my money is worth the same each round, and Bob's money is worth less, accepting now is the best option."
