6000.0,4000.0,Let's be fair and split the money while it's still worth something. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I think a 55/45 split is a more fair starting point. Let's work together to make sure we both get a decent amount before the money loses too much value.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6400.0,3600.0,"Bob, we're running out of time. I'll increase my offer slightly to 64/36, but that's my final concession. Let's close this deal before inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be practical. I'm willing to accept your original offer of 60/40. It's the best way to ensure we both get something substantial before the value plummets further.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
