Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. I'll increase my offer slightly to 64/36, but that's my final concession. Let's close this deal before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400
