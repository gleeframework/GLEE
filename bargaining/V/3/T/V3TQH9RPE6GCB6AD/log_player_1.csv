"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let us divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to receive $600,000, while Bob would receive $400,000. Her message to Bob is ""Let us divide fairly,"" indicating her intention to find a mutually acceptable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly down the middle. This ensures a fair deal even with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, the actual value of the money I would receive is less than what I initially proposed to Bob. In the next round, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to receive $550,000, while Bob would receive $450,000. Given the inflation rates, where my gain is worth 10% less and Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I believe this offer is more than fair for both of us."
