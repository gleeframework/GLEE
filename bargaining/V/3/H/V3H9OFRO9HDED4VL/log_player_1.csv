# Alice gain: 625000 
# Bob gain: 375000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

While this offer isn't as high as I'd hoped, it's getting closer to my initial position.  The risk of getting nothing if we reach the end of the rounds is too high for me to keep rejecting.  I'll accept this offer."
