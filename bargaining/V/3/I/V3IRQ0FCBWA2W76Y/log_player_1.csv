"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"", hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. How about 55/45, with the majority going to the proposer this round? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I suppose it's a decent compromise. Considering the money I gain is worth 10% less this round, I'd rather accept this offer than risk going to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
