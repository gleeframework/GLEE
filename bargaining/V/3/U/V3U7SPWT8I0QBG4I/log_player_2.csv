Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait, I think there's been a mistake! You said the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, but that's not true. Since there are 12 rounds and we've only had 3 rounds so far, the money should be worth 90% of its original value, which is 10% less than in the first round. So, the money I gain is worth 90% of 3000, which is 2700.

In any case, I'll make my decision based on the offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value, I'll make an offer that takes this into account.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3700 
# Alice gain: 6300 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 66.61% of its original value, so I'll calculate my gain accordingly.

Since I'm considering Alice's offer, I'll accept it.
