"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a good starting point. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I'm worth more. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he's worth more, huh?

I'll play along. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think it's too skewed in his favor. I'm hoping he'll make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, my target amount should be adjusted accordingly. Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. This is a more reasonable split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a significant reduction from his previous offer. My message is a gentle nudge towards finding a more balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm still not impressed. Meet my price or I'll walk. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting!

I'm not getting desperate, but I do need to consider the decreasing value of the money. Bob's offer is still quite one-sided, but I'll have to weigh the risks.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, hoping that he'll make a more reasonable offer in the next round. I'm not willing to accept a split that's this skewed in his favor, even if the money is worth less."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

With the money worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I need to adjust my target amount accordingly. Considering Bob's previous offers, I'll aim for an even more aggressive split this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting desperate, but I'm not getting taken advantage of either. Meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a significant reduction from his previous offers. My message is a firm but polite nudge towards finding a more balanced split."
