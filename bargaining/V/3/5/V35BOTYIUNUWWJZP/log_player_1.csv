"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'm actually gaining more value in this offer compared to the first round.

However, I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal. I was hoping for a more even split, but Bob's offer is closer to 60/40 in his favor.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think I'm still being generous 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation in this round, Bob's gain is worth a lot less than in the first round, but still more than mine.

Considering the offer, I'm gaining more than in the previous round, but Bob is still getting a larger share. I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal, but I'm also not eager to reject another offer and risk getting a worse deal in the next round.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,

# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the high inflation in this round, Bob's gain is worth a lot less than in the first round, but still more than mine. I'm gaining more than in the previous round, but Bob is still getting a larger share.
