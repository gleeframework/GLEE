"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I get 90%, you get 10%. This is a good start for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
It's early in the game and a 90/10 split is far too lopsided. Let's see if we can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split. This is a fairer starting point, and we can adjust as we go along.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here. I'm willing to go down to a 60/40 split, but I need more than what you offered last round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

A 60/40 split is a reasonable compromise. While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to take effect and I don't want to risk losing everything."
