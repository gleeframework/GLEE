"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. Given the rules of the game, where the value of money decreases with each round, it's strategic to try to end the game as early as possible to maximize the real value of the money received. However, the initial offer needs to be reasonable enough for Bob to consider accepting it, considering he might be aware that the value of money decreases more significantly for me than for him with each round. The message aims to appeal to fairness while acknowledging that I'm taking a slightly larger share, hoping Bob will find it acceptable to avoid further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair, given the potential for inflation.  Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the adjusted values due to inflation, accepting this offer would mean I'd actually receive less than the face value compared to if we settled in the first round, considering the money is worth 20% less for me now. Since Bob is less affected by inflation, his offer doesn't compensate for the loss I'd incur by accepting a lower amount that also devalues faster for me. Strategically, it's better for me to proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal or to pressure Bob into accepting a division more favorable to me as the rounds progress and the threat of receiving nothing increases."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle, slightly in my favor given my higher devaluation rate""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a division slightly more favorable to me than the initial offer, but still attempting to appear reasonable and open to compromise. Given that the money's value decreases more rapidly for me, there's an urgency to conclude the game sooner rather than later. By suggesting a division that is closer to an even split but still acknowledges the impact of inflation on my potential gain, I aim to persuade Bob that accepting this offer is preferable to risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. The message is crafted to convey a sense of urgency and fairness, hoping to appeal to Bob's rationality and self-interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. With inflation continuing, it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, accepting an even split is the most rational decision. The money I receive is now worth nearly half of its original value, and this devaluation will continue to worsen with each subsequent round. Given that Bob's offer is fair and splits the remaining value evenly, and considering the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, accepting this offer maximizes my expected utility under the current circumstances. It's a strategic decision to accept this offer now rather than risking further loss due to inflation."
