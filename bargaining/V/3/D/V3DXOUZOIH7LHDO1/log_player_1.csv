"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it gives us both a decent chunk of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share this time. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to accept Bob's offer just yet. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much this early in the game. Let's try again!""}

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50 this time. No hard feelings, right?""}

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with each of us getting 50% of the remaining $100. I think this is a fair compromise, and it gives us both a chance to regroup and reassess our strategy."
