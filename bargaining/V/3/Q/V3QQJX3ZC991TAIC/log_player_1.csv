"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think for a moment...

I'll reject this offer. My gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, which makes the difference in our gains less significant. I'll try to make a better offer next time.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","In Round 3, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly higher share this time, given the reduced value of the money."
