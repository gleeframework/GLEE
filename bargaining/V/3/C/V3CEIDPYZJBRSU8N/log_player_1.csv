"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $500,000 and Bob will take $500,000. It's a 50/50 split, but I'm glad we could agree on something before things get even more complicated with inflation!"
