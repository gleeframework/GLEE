I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000. This is a generous offer, especially considering the upcoming inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I offer to take 850,000 dollars and give Bob 150,000. This is a more fair offer, as the inflation has hurt Bob more significantly than it has me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more money, the inflation has made this a much better deal than the previous round.  I'm taking the offer to avoid risking losing even more."
