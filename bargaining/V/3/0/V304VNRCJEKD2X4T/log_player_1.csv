"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000

```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'm the one making the proposal in this round, I'll decide whether to accept or reject.

```

```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, but still a reasonable compromise. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

I'll accept Bob's offer. The game is over, and we'll split the $1,000,000 accordingly."
