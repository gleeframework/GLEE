"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but you get a chance to even things out later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Alice's proposal is too lopsided, and I believe we can find a more equitable division of the funds. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. Given the inflation rates, this seems like a fair starting point.""}\n\nI'm aiming for a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation rates that affect both of us. This offer gives me a larger share, but still leaves a substantial amount for Alice, considering her higher inflation rate. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make sure I get a decent share after the inflation hits. Let's get closer to a 60/40 split. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Alice's offer, considering the inflation rates. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'd like to hold out for a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a more mutually beneficial agreement.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share. This offer still gives you a substantial amount, but I need to account for the decreasing value of the money.""}\n\nI've increased my proposed share slightly, taking into account the rising inflation rates. This offer still leaves a decent amount for Alice, but I believe it's more reflective of the current situation. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This inflation is getting out of hand!  Let's find a more balanced split. I'm willing to accept less now to avoid losing even more later. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the rapidly increasing inflation rates, I think Alice's offer is reasonable. The money is worth significantly less now, and it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in future rounds. This split seems relatively balanced, considering the circumstances. Let's accept the offer and conclude the game!"
