"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable proposal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, no need to be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting the offer because I think I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the inflation and trying to negotiate a better share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is as high as I can go. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I still think I can do better than a 52-48 split, especially considering the significant inflation that has reduced the value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to account for the continued inflation and trying to negotiate a better share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up more, I think this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5600 
# Bob gain: 4400 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's final offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, given the continued inflation, I'm not sure I can do better than this. The value of the money has decreased significantly, and I think this is the best I can get. I'll take the 56% share."
