"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm proposing a fair but generous split. Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is very unequal.  I'm willing to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a fair starting point. Let's see if we can agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but we need to move towards an agreement quickly before the money loses too much value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is becoming a real concern.  This offer is acceptable, and we can at least avoid losing more money."
