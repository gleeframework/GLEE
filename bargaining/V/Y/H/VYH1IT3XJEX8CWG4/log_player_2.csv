Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. This is a reasonable compromise that gives us both a good amount. Let's end this now.

# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are steadily moving in my favor. I'm willing to gamble another round or two to see if I can secure an even larger portion of the money. While the value for Alice is decreasing, mine remains the same, putting me in a stronger bargaining position as the rounds progress."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. This offer reflects a fair split given the circumstances and the dwindling time. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a favorable outcome. This offer represents a balance between maximizing my potential gain and securing a deal before time runs out. Alice is likely feeling the pressure of the decreasing value and might be more inclined to accept a less favorable deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close to the end. Let's split it evenly and avoid any more risk. We'll both be better off. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, a 50/50 split is a good deal at this stage.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We are running out of rounds, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing significantly.
* **Alice's Desperation:**  Alice offering a 50/50 split after rejecting this before shows she understands the urgency and is likely to concede. 
* **Guaranteed Return:**  A sure $500,000 is a good outcome, and holding out for a potentially slightly larger share carries a significant risk of getting nothing."
