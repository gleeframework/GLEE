"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the potential for inflation to eat away at my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer guarantees me $5,000, and with inflation, any further negotiation risks losing a significant portion of my potential gains."
