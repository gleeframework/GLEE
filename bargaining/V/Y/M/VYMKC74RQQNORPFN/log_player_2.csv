"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's better to reject this offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate a more equitable split.  The risk of inflation is too high to accept a 20/80 split right away."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly.  It's the fairest way to start, and we can both benefit from the inflation risk.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 40/60 split is closer to a fair split, it's still a significant imbalance in favor of Alice. It's worth continuing to negotiate and seeing if Alice is willing to compromise further. The inflation risk is still a concern, but I believe I can get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight advantage to account for inflation, but I need a fairer split than the last offer. Let's meet in the middle.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm taking a firmer stance, considering the inflation risk. Meet me at this point or I'll propose an even more uneven split next round. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation risk is significant, I can't accept a 35/65 split. This offer is too far from a fair split, and it's likely Alice is bluffing about her stance. I'll continue negotiating and see if we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation risk is affecting your decision, but I'm still aiming for a fairer split.  This offer is a compromise, let's see if we can reach an agreement before the next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to my target, meet me here or I'll take an even larger share next round. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is increasingly unfair, and while the inflation risk is high, I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split.  Alice's threats are becoming more aggressive, but I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's worth pushing back and seeing if she will budge closer to a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 3500, ""alice_gain"": 6500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise to avoid losing all the money due to inflation, but this offer is my final stand.  I believe we can reach a fair agreement before the risk of getting nothing becomes too high.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my last offer. I'm taking a risk, but I believe I deserve a larger share considering the inflation risk. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is incredibly unbalanced and unfair, even considering the risk of inflation. While the risk of getting nothing is now very high, accepting this offer would mean I'm essentially giving Alice a 3/4 share of the money. I'm going to risk it and see if I can negotiate a fairer split in the next round. It's possible that Alice is bluffing and will be willing to compromise to avoid ending up with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 3000, ""alice_gain"": 7000, ""message"": ""We're running out of time, and the risk of getting nothing is very real.  This offer reflects the increasing inflation risk, but I'm still trying to be fair. Let's find a compromise before it's too late.""}

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 40.13% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. I'm taking a huge risk, but I believe I deserve a larger share considering the inflation risk and my previous offers. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a tough decision, as the risk of getting nothing is now extremely high. However, I'm still not willing to accept a 20/80 split. Even with the inflation, I believe a fairer deal is possible.  It's risky, but I'm going to gamble on reaching a better agreement in the final round.  It's possible Alice will realize the risk of getting nothing and be willing to compromise."

{""bob_gain"": 2500, ""alice_gain"": 7500, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. It's a huge risk, but I believe it's the fairest way to split the money given the inflation and our past negotiations.  Let's both take a chance on reaching a compromise before it's too late.""}
