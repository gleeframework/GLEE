"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take 99 dollars and leave 1 dollar for Bob. Since this is the first round, there's no inflation to worry about, and I want to maximize my share. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to keep more of the money, Bob's offer is fair given the inflation factor.  Taking 50 dollars is better than getting nothing if we reject and go to another round."
