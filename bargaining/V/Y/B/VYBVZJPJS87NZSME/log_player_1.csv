"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, I'll take less to give you a chance to think about it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to compromise to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I need a little more for myself. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept this offer since it's my turn to make the next proposal, and I don't want to leave it all to Bob. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
