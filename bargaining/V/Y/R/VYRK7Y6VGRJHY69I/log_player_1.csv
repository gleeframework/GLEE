"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take 999,000 and give Bob 1,000.  I figure this is a good starting point, as I want to secure the majority of the money, but I also want to be fair to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm going to try to secure a bigger share than before, but still offer Bob a reasonable amount.  He's clearly more willing to bargain now, so I'll give him a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10750 
# Bob gain: 989250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this is a far cry from my initial offer, it's better than nothing, and considering inflation, it's probably the best I can hope for at this point."
