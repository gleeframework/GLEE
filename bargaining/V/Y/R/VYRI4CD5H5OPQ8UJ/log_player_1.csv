"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm the first to make it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, my offer would be less valuable than before.

I will accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It seems like a fair split, and I'd rather take this deal than risk waiting for another round with even less valuable money."
