Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each passing round. Let's be reasonable and split it 50/50.  It's a fair and equal deal, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal at the start, the inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I receive a reasonable amount of money (which is still a significant sum despite the inflation) rather than risking getting nothing if we fail to agree within 12 rounds."
