Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  I want to maximize my gains while still leaving him with something. Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my original offer.  While the money is worth less for both of us due to inflation, the drop in value is much more significant for him.  I'm going to reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to try to find a middle ground. I'll offer Bob a bit more than his last offer, but still give myself a majority share.  Hopefully, this is good enough for him to accept before inflation erodes the value even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is a lot less than what I initially wanted, the inflation has seriously hurt Bob's side of the bargain. My share is worth significantly less than in the first round, and the inflation will only continue to erode the value of the money. It's best to accept and end the game before it gets any worse."
