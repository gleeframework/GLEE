Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round. The 5% inflation isn't too bad, and I think I can negotiate for a larger share."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob, but this is my final offer. Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've already lost some value due to inflation, but I think I can still get a better deal. Alice says this is her final offer, but I'm willing to take the risk and see if she's bluffing. Maybe she'll be more willing to compromise in the next round."
