Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer for Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'll keep an eye on the inflation and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair, especially considering inflation. It's better to secure this amount now than risk getting less in the next round."
