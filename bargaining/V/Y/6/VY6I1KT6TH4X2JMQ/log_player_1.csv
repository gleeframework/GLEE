"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair starting point for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my thinking accordingly. In the first round, I was offered $60, which is now worth 95% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $57.

Bob's new offer is a 50-50 split, which is a significant increase from my original offer. Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll decide to reject it for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. In the second round, I would have gotten $57, so in the third round, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $55 and Bob getting $45. My message is a bit more assertive, indicating that I'm willing to negotiate, but still want to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55 is a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to calculate the equivalent value of my desired gain from the previous round. In the first round, I was aiming for $60, which is now worth 85.74% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $51.44.

Considering the new offer from Bob, I'm getting $45, which is above the equivalent value of my desired gain. However, I'm still getting a smaller share than I initially wanted. I'll decide to accept this offer, as it's a better deal than the equivalent value of my desired gain.
