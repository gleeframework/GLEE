"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to take $90 and leave $10 for Bob. This is a generous offer, especially considering that the money will be worth less in the next round. I hope he accepts it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While it seems like a reasonable offer, I'm confident that I can get a better deal. I'm willing to wait and see what Bob proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm still willing to be fair, but I'm raising my share slightly. With each round, the money is worth less, so I need to ensure I'm getting a good deal. I hope Bob will accept this offer to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is significantly lower than what I hoped for, the inflation is starting to hurt. It's important to remember that the money I'm getting is worth a lot less than it was in the first round. I'll accept this offer to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
