"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. It's a good offer considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than your initial offer, considering I'm losing more value each round. Let's meet closer to the middle!""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that slightly favors me, but still gives Alice a significant share. The message aims to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable middle ground, while also highlighting the impact of inflation on my end. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. I'm losing less each round, so how about I take $55 and you get $45? 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Alice's offer in round 3. Although the offer seems closer to a middle ground, considering the inflation, I'm still losing more value each round than Alice. I'd like to proceed to the next round and make another counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us, but especially for me. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation difference, I'm willing to meet closer to your offer, but I still need a bit more to make up for my losses. Let's find a balance!""}\n\n###\n\nI've made an offer that slightly adjusts my previous proposal, taking into account the fact that I'm losing more value each round. The message aims to convey my willingness to find a mutually acceptable solution while also highlighting the need to balance out the losses due to inflation. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a fair deal. Let's split it down the middle at $50 each. This way, we both walk away with something before inflation eats away at it any further. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer in round 5. Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, splitting the money down the middle seems like a fair and reasonable compromise. At this point, it's better to secure $50 rather than risking further losses due to inflation. I'm satisfied with this outcome, and I think we've reached a mutually beneficial agreement."
