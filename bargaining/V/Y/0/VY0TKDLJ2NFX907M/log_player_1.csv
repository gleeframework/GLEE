"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even distribution. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: Let's flip the script - I'll take 60%, you take 40%.  It's only fair!  ðŸ˜‰ 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not so fast, Bob!

I'll reject your offer. I'd rather not give you the majority of the money so early in the game.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 55-45!""
}
```

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute, Bob! You're trying to trick me!

I remember you rejected my 55-45 offer in the previous round, and now you're offering the same split? I'm not falling for it!

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to meet you halfway, but I want a bit more. 52-48, it's a fair deal!""

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get me to accept a deal that's similar to my previous offer!

However, I'm not convinced that 52-48 is the best deal for me. I'd rather try to get a better offer.
