"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a fair but slightly skewed deal. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm not going to accept such a low offer, especially since we have 12 rounds to go and the money loses value. I need more than $1000."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point.  It's a good deal for both of us, and we can work from there if you're not happy.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle.  I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
I'll accept this offer.  Alice is being reasonable, and 4000 is a much better starting point than 1000."
