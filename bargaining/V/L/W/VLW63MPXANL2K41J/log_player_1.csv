"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 900000,
""bob_gain"": 100000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 800000,
""bob_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's try this again.  Time is running out and the pot is shrinking.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a good chunk, but I need more than your last offer.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily in his favor.  The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation benefits Bob. It's time to start being more assertive, but without being overly greedy."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it - we both lose if we wait any longer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  It's time for a bold move. Offering 70/30 is still generous to Alice given the inflation, but the strong ""final offer"" language might push Bob to accept rather than risk getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round.  This offer is closer to what I need, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you want to keep playing. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one, but it's time to cut losses.  Bob is clearly willing to play the long game and knows the inflation favors him. Accepting 600,000 now is better than risking getting a worse offer (or nothing) in later rounds where the value to Alice is significantly diminished."
