"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a relatively fair deal considering the inflation rates. Since my inflation rate is lower, I'm trying to negotiate a slightly higher share for myself. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fairer way to start, considering we're both taking a hit on the value of the money with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation rates, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. With each passing round, the money is worth significantly less for Bob, so I'm hoping he'll be more willing to compromise in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less for both of us, I'll try to find a compromise that takes into account the decreasing value.\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation hit we're both taking, I think 58/42 is a reasonable split. Let's settle on this before the money loses more value!""}"
