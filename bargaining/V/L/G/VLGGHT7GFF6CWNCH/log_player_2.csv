Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous, Bob. I'm willing to take a bigger loss to end this, but I need at least 38 dollars.  Otherwise, we'll just keep going until we're both getting pennies. 
# Bob gain: 62 
# Alice gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is a reasonable offer, considering the decreasing value of the money for Alice. Continuing the game would only lead to further losses for her, and I'm satisfied with gaining 62 dollars. Let's end the game here."
