"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I get $60 and you get $40.  It's important to reach a deal quickly because of the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###  \nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I think we can do better than your initial offer. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more to secure the deal now. Let's divide it 55-45, and we'll both be better off.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a quick deal, but your offer wasn't fair to me.  This is my counter-offer: $55 for me, $45 for you. Let's agree now and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}
### 
I'll reject this offer since it's essentially the same as my previous offer but with the values flipped in Alice's favor. Given the increasing impact of inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Alice, considering the rising costs of inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more risk to secure a deal. My new offer is 58-42 in my favor. This way, we both still get a significant amount, but I believe this division better reflects the urgency of the situation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money with every passing round.  I'm adjusting my offer slightly - $52 for me, $48 for you.  This is a fair compromise. Let's be realistic and close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###  \nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains, Alice's offer of $52 for her and $48 for me seems like a reasonable compromise. Further rounds will only continue to devalue the money, likely leading to a worse outcome for both of us. Accepting this offer ensures we both get something substantial out of the deal before the value drops even more drastically."
