I propose taking 9000 dollars and giving Bob 1000 dollars. This leaves a large margin for negotiation in the future rounds, if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a slightly less generous offer than my initial proposal. Since Bob rejected my first offer, I believe he's prioritizing getting a large share. By offering 8000 for myself and 2000 for Bob, I hope to find a compromise that both of us can accept before the inflation further reduces the value of the money."
