"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess later.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more aggressive approach this time. I think I can get a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to be more cautious. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to think carefully about accepting a proposal that gives me less than before.

However, I don't know how Bob's offer is affected by inflation, so I'll have to consider the relative values. Since I'm getting 40, which is 40% of the current total, and I know that my gain is worth 5% less, I can infer that Bob is getting a larger share, but I don't know how much larger.

Considering Bob's message, he seems to be taking a more aggressive approach, so I'll reject his offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, I'll propose a slightly smaller share for myself. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""
}
```

I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up much more, but I'll try to make a slightly better offer. This is my last chance to get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! With my gain being worth 14.26% less, I'll have to be careful with my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting 30, which is 30% of the current total. However, I'm not sure how much this is worth in real terms, considering the inflation.

Since Bob's message suggests this is his last chance, I'll try to negotiate further. I don't want to give up too much, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round with an even lower share.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be even more cautious. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to prioritize my own gain. Let's see if you'll accept this compromise.""
}
```

I'm giving Bob a larger share, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
