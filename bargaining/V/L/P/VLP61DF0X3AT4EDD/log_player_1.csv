"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a 9000/1000 split, with me getting the majority share.  This seems fair, as I'm the one making the first offer!  Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk getting an even worse deal if we continue playing!  Let's end this game."
