"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, Bob, considering the time value of money.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness with Inflation:**  I'm starting with a slightly advantageous split for myself (Alice) to account for the fact that the money loses value for me in each round due to the 5% inflation. This incentivizes Bob to agree now.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise and explains the reasoning behind the offer, promoting transparency and potentially fostering a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it 55/45 in my favor, considering the time value of money for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is even worse for Alice than the first round, despite his acknowledgement of the time value of money.  Here's why I'm rejecting:

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Accepting this sets a bad precedent. Bob is likely to continue pushing for an even larger share in subsequent rounds.
* **Still Early:** It's only the second round.  The penalty for waiting isn't too severe yet, and there's room to negotiate a better deal. 
* **Strategic Rejection:** By rejecting, I signal to Bob that I'm not going to accept an unfair deal and that he needs to make a more serious offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome. I'm unlikely to accept anything less, especially with inflation working against me.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm making it clear that I'm not willing to accept an unfair deal, but I'm also offering a solution that is objectively fair.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm emphasizing the time pressure by stating that I'm unlikely to accept anything less, especially with inflation eroding my potential gains. 
* **Simplicity and Clarity:**  A 50/50 split is easy to understand and doesn't leave room for misinterpretation, increasing the chances of Bob accepting."
