**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, Bob is in a strong position due to the inflation dynamic. Alice's share is rapidly losing value, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time runs out. Bob can afford to hold out for a better offer in the next round."
