"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and propose a 4:1 ratio. It's a bold move, but I think it's worth it to get a bigger share before inflation hits. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
