"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the smaller share""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually taking a slightly smaller share to start off with. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, no need for negotiation 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about splitting it exactly down the middle, and I think I can do better. Since the money is worth less now, I'll try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm trying to squeeze out a slightly better deal for myself, while still leaving Bob with a decent share. Let's see if Bob will bite!"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Whoa, Bob is really trying to take advantage of the inflation! I'm not going to let him get away with taking the majority of the money. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll try to get a bit more for myself, even if it means going back to the drawing board."

I'm proposing that I get $4,200 and Bob gets $5,800. I'm trying to find a compromise that gives Bob a slightly bigger share, but still keeps me from getting too taken advantage of. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Oh no, Bob is really trying to squeeze me dry! I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only $3,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll try to get a bit more for myself, even if it means going down to the wire."
