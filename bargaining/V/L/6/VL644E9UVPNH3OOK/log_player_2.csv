Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You wanted 55-45, I'll give you 42-58, but in my favor. It's only fair since your money is losing value 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of my losses due to inflation. While her offer is closer to a more ""fair"" split, it's still heavily in her favor considering my money is losing value.  I need to push for a better deal in the next round before inflation eats away too much of my potential earnings."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""This is my last offer Alice.  52/48 split in my favor.  It accounts for some inflation, but is still a good deal for you before the money is worth even less for me.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm applying a sense of urgency and finality to encourage Alice to accept. Waiting any longer significantly hurts me due to inflation. Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Accounts for Inflation:** The 52/48 split in my favor is a slightly better deal than a straight 50/50 split if we consider the money's present value for me. 
* **Fair to Alice:** It's still a substantial amount of money for Alice, and significantly more than her previous offer of 420,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk Alice might reject this, forcing me to accept an even lower amount in the next round. However, the potential reward of securing 520,000 now outweighs the risk of getting a slightly lower amount later, especially considering the rapid inflation."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your last offer, but I'm not buying it. My patience is wearing thin, take this 57-43 split or we'll be here forever 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but the relentless march of inflation is forcing my hand. Here's why accepting is the least bad option at this point:

* **Significant Losses:** The 34.39% inflation means I'm losing a huge chunk of potential earnings with each passing round.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to hold out for a slightly better deal is getting riskier.  There's no guarantee Alice will ever offer more than 430,000, and even if she does, the inflation will eat away at the gains. 
* **""Bird in Hand"" Principle:** It's often better to take a decent deal now than gamble on a potentially better but uncertain deal later.

While 430,000 is significantly less than what I aimed for initially, it's better than getting locked into an even worse deal as inflation continues to erode my potential gains."
