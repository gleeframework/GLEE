"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get more money. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. It's the fairest option.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although I would prefer more money, accepting this offer is the best option given the inflation. In the next round, Alice will be able to propose a more favorable offer for her, and I risk getting less in the end."
