"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we should split more equally, considering I'm losing value each round.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision. I'm excited to see how she reacts to my proposal."

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise a little. This offer still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better deal. The current offer doesn't seem good enough, considering the decreasing value of the money for me. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fairer split to account for the loss in value.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice responds to this offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground while keeping in mind the impact of inflation on my share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it - the clock is ticking and we both lose if this keeps up. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. Alice says it's her final offer, but I'm not convinced she won't come back with a better proposal if I reject this one. The threat of both of us losing out if we don't agree soon might work in my favor. On to the next round!"

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'm trying to meet you halfway, Alice. Considering the significant loss in value I'm facing due to inflation, I believe this split is more than fair. Let's end this before we both lose out.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping Alice will see the reason in my proposal and accept it. The decreasing value of the money is starting to take a significant toll on my potential gain, and I'm eager to find a mutually acceptable agreement before it's too late."
