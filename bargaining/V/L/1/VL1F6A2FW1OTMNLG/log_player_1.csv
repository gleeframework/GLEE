"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial 100$, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll consider the effective gains as follows:

* My gain: 20 / 0.9 = 22.22 (approximately)
* Bob's gain: 80 / 0.8 = 100 (approximately)

Considering the new values, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This way, I'll get 50% of the remaining 100$, and Bob will get the other 50%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is getting intense!

Let's calculate the effective gains considering the new inflation rates:

* My gain: 10 / (1 - 0.271) = 10 / 0.729 ≈ 13.71
* Bob's gain: 90 / (1 - 0.488) = 90 / 0.512 ≈ 175.78

Considering the new values, I'll decide to reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The game continues!

Considering the new inflation rate of 27.1% for me, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70
}
```

This way, I'll get 30% of the remaining 100$, and Bob will get the other 70%."
