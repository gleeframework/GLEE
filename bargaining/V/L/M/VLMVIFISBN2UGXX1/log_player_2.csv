**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is reducing her demand. However,  it's still early in the game, and I'm not in a desperate position yet. By continuing to reject her offers that don't meet closer to a 50/50 split, I increase the chances of her offering a better deal in the later rounds."
