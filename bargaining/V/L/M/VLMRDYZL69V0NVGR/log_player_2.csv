Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, Bob is losing a significant amount of money due to inflation. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer of $440,000 is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds, especially as Alice seems unwilling to budge much.
