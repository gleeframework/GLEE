60.0,40.0,"Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal for both of us.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
35.0,65.0,"I think we can do better than a 60-40 split. How about 65-35? It's still fair, but gives me a bit more for taking the lead in this round.",Bob,2,

58.0,42.0,"58-42 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
32.0,68.0,"I think we can both do better than a 58-42 split, especially with inflation in mind. Let's try 68-32. It's a good compromise, and we can both get a decent share.",Bob,4,

56.0,44.0,"Considering the increasing inflation, 56-44 seems like a fairer split to account for the loss in value.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
28.0,72.0,"I'm willing to give you a little more to end this quickly.  How about 72-28?  We've both had our chances to make proposals, and the inflation is only going to hurt us more.",Bob,6,

54.0,46.0,"Given the extreme inflation, a 54-46 split is more reasonable to compensate for my loss in value.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
25.0,75.0,"I'm getting tired of this back and forth.  I'm going to make one final offer.  75-25 is my last attempt to come to an agreement.  It's still a fair split, considering the inflation has significantly impacted the value of your share.  Let's get this done.",Bob,8,
