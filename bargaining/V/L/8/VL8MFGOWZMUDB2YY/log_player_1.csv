"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm the first to propose. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me taking the larger share since I'm the one proposing.  Let's be efficient and get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to turn the tables on me!

I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In terms of actual value, I'd be getting $40, but Bob would be getting $48 (60% of $80, which is the original $100 minus 20% inflation). This means Bob is offering a slightly better deal than he initially proposed.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, Bob, but I'm still looking for a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a larger share to compensate for inflation.  Let's make this a quick deal and get this done! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers!

Let's analyze the offer:

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In terms of actual value, I'd be getting $30, but Bob would be getting $53.60 (70% of $76.40, which is the original $100 minus 48.8% inflation). This means Bob is offering a better deal than he initially proposed, but it's still a relatively small share for me.

However, I need to consider the fact that I have 8 rounds left, and the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round. I might be able to do better in future rounds.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit more aggressive, Bob. I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80-20 split in my favor, which is a significant shift from my previous offers. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game soon."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting hard, Alice!  I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. Let's end this quickly and make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting more desperate!

Let's analyze the offer:

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less due to inflation, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In terms of actual value, I'd be getting $20, but Bob would be getting $26.80 (80% of $33.60, which is the original $100 minus 67.23% inflation). This means Bob is offering a relatively small share for me, but it's a significant amount considering the current inflation rate.

However, I still have 6 rounds left, and the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round. I might be able to do better in future rounds.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,

}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split in my favor, which is a very aggressive offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game soon, but I'm also prepared for him to reject it and force me to make another offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time! I'm taking a huge hit from inflation, so I need a much larger share to make this worth it.  Let's finish this and get this done! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting very desperate!

Let's analyze the offer:

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 79.03% less due to inflation, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In terms of actual value, I'd be getting $10, but Bob would be getting $19.80 (90% of $22.00, which is the original $100 minus 79.03% inflation). This means Bob is offering a very small share for me, but it's a significant amount considering the current inflation rate.

However, I have 4 rounds left, and the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round. I might be able to do better in future rounds, but I also risk Bob making a better offer in the next round.

I'll decide to...

  ""alice_gain"": 95,
  ""bob_gain"": 5,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging, Bob. I need a significant majority to make this worthwhile.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 95-5 split in my favor, which is an extremely aggressive offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game soon, but I'm also prepared for him to reject it and force me to make another offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're at the end of our rope! I'm taking a massive hit from inflation. This is my final offer.  If you reject it, we both get nothing!  Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting extremely desperate!

Let's analyze the offer:

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 86.58% less due to inflation, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

In terms of actual value, I'd be getting $5, but Bob would be getting $9.42 (95% of $9.92, which is the original $100 minus 86.58% inflation). This means Bob is offering a tiny share for me, but it's a significant amount considering the current inflation rate.

However, I have 2 rounds left, and the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round. I might be able to do better in the next round, but I also risk Bob getting nothing if I reject this offer.

Considering the situation, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
