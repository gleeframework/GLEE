"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount, hopefully making it seem like a fair starting point. I want to see if he'll accept it or try to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial offer, even after accounting for the inflation. I will reject it and see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for inflation, but still giving myself a larger share. I believe this is a more balanced offer than Bob's previous proposal, and hopefully will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than my initial offer, even with the inflation. I'm willing to keep playing and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to account for inflation, but this time I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to incentivize him to accept. This is a more even split, but still gives me a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a much better offer than Bob's previous ones, and it's getting close to an even split. While inflation has eaten away at the value of the money, it's still a significant sum, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we continue to play."
