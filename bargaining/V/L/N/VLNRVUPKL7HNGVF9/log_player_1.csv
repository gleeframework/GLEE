"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI propose that I, Alice, receive $600,000 and Bob receive $400,000. This division is slightly in my favor, but I believe it's fair considering the decreasing value of money for Bob in subsequent rounds. The message ""Let's split fairly"" aims to convey a sense of reasonableness and encourage Bob to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation of his potential share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should split it more evenly. This feels more fair. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, although the message appeals to fairness, the division of $400,000 for me and $600,000 for Bob is significantly less favorable to me than my initial offer. Considering the money's value remains constant for me but decreases for Bob with each round, I have an incentive to either negotiate for a better split or wait for a potentially better offer in subsequent rounds. Accepting this offer immediately would mean I lose out on a significant amount without letting the negotiation process unfold further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nFor round 3, I propose a division where I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. This offer is a compromise between my initial proposal and Bob's offer in round 2, hence the message ""Meet in the middle."" Given that the value of money for Bob decreases with each round, this offer presents a reasonable adjustment that still favors me but is closer to an even split than my first offer. It also acknowledges Bob's desire for a more even distribution while considering the impact of inflation on his share. By meeting in the middle, I aim to find a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's the fairest way to do this. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer of an even split, where both of us receive $500,000. Although Bob's message emphasizes fairness, the ongoing inflation affecting his share means that, in real terms, his $500,000 is worth significantly less than mine. Given the impact of inflation, an even split at this point is not as equitable as it initially seems. Since the value of the money remains constant for me but decreases for Bob with each round, I can potentially negotiate for a better deal in the following rounds. Thus, accepting this offer now might not be the most advantageous decision for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nFor round 5, I propose a division where I receive $525,000 and Bob receives $475,000. This offer is slightly more generous than my previous one, acknowledging the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's share. The message ""Getting closer"" aims to convey that I am willing to move towards a more even split but still recognizes the differing values of our shares due to inflation. By incrementally adjusting my offer, I aim to reach a point where Bob feels the division is fair enough to accept, considering the decreasing value of his potential share with each passing round.
{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Getting closer""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is the fairest deal.  We should agree now before inflation hurts us both. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accept Bob's offer of an even split, where both of us receive $500,000. At this point, despite the fact that Bob's share is worth significantly less due to inflation, his message correctly points out that further rounds will only continue to devalue his share without affecting mine. Given that we are already halfway through the rounds and the offers have been incrementally adjusting towards a middle ground, accepting this offer seems prudent. Continuing to reject offers in hopes of a marginally better deal risks pushing the negotiations too far and potentially resulting in both of us receiving nothing. Thus, accepting this offer ensures a guaranteed gain, which, considering the circumstances, seems the most sensible decision at this juncture."
