"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation.

I reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The offer is too skewed towards Bob, and I'd rather wait for a better opportunity."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer, taking into account the 5% decrease in value due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the current value of the money, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money keeps decreasing!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. However, 2000 is a relatively small amount, and I don't want to risk losing even more value by rejecting this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer from Round 4.
