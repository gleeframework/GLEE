Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't bluff, negotiate! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to push me towards a less favorable outcome.  While the time pressure is on, accepting an offer below a 50/50 split this early sets a bad precedent. I'm hoping my ""final offer"" bluff in the previous round might make her reconsider."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be reasonable. We both know a 50/50 split is the fairest option.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Alice didn't budge after my ""final offer"" bluff, so I need to re-engage in negotiation.  Returning to a 50/50 split emphasizes fairness and avoids further losses due to inflation."
