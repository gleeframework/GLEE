Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly.  There's still time to apply pressure. It's unlikely she wants to walk away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Alice.  We're losing serious money with every round. 51/49 is my final offer."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:**  By round 6, it's important to highlight the rapidly decreasing value of the potential winnings. 
* **Slight Concession:**  Moving to a 51/49 split shows a willingness to compromise, but only slightly. 
* **Finality:**  Adding ""final offer"" introduces a sense of urgency and may push Alice to accept before even more money is lost to inflation."
