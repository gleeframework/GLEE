"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, given that I'm taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain. Given Bob's counteroffer, I'm not inclined to accept a 40% share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking a toll on my potential gain, and I need to adjust my strategy. Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on a 55-45 split, let's move forward""
}
```"
