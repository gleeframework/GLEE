"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I need to consider that when evaluating the offer. My gain of 50 in this round is equivalent to 40 in the previous round, which is less than my initial offer of 60. However, Bob's gain of 50 is the same as in the previous round, so it's not affected by inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly more aggressive this time to account for the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
