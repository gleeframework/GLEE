Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  While this might seem greedy, I want to see how Bob reacts and if he's willing to accept an offer that favors me heavily.  This will give me a good idea of how he values the money and if he's willing to play a more strategic game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, given the inflation and the risk of getting nothing, a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome. Accepting this offer ensures I get a significant portion of the money, and prevents me from risking getting nothing if we continue to disagree."
