"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the fact that the value of money decreases for Alice but not for me. Since Alice's offer was 45% for me and 55% for her, I'll try to tilt the scales a bit in my favor while still being somewhat reasonable.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation hits you harder, I think this is a fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against me, I need a better offer to make it worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 425000 
# Alice gain: 575000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that the value of money remains constant for me but decreases significantly for Alice (36% less than the first round), I have a strong incentive to continue negotiating for a better deal. Alice's offer in this round is actually worse for me than her initial offer, so I see no reason to accept it. I'll hold out for a more favorable split.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see what I can propose next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make an offer that continues to take into account the impact of inflation on Alice's gains. Since the money is worth 36% less to her than in the first round, and my previous offer was rejected, I'll adjust my proposal slightly to try and find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Alice, while still favoring me due to the circumstances.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on your side, I'm willing to offer a bit more to compensate, but I also need to consider my own interests.""}"
