Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:** While the time pressure is on, Alice is showing she's willing to budge but is still trying to take a larger share. With the rate of inflation, holding out a bit longer in hopes of a better deal makes sense.  We don't want to panic and accept a bad deal, but we also can't be too greedy."
