Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n### 

In this offer, Alice proposes to take $55 and leave $45 for Bob, attaching the message ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"" to justify her proposal. Now, it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round to make his own proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

I reject Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, especially considering that the money is worth less to Bob than it is to me due to the higher inflation rate affecting his share. I'll proceed to the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I think this is more than fair""}\n\n### 

In this offer, I've increased my share to $58 and reduced Bob's share to $42, considering that the money is worth less to him due to the higher inflation rate. I've attached a message to justify my proposal, emphasizing that I think this division is more than fair given the circumstances. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than that. Let's split it 55/45. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

I reject Bob's offer because, despite his willingness to compromise, the proposed division of 55/45 in his favor does not take into account the significant impact of inflation on his share. Given that the money is worth 48.8% less to Bob than in the first round, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. I'll proceed to the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you harder, I think this is a fair adjustment""}\n\n### 

In this offer, I've increased my share to $60 and reduced Bob's share to $40, taking into account the significant impact of inflation on his share. Since the money is worth 48.8% less to Bob than in the first round, I believe this division is a fair adjustment to the original proposal. I've attached a message to justify my proposal, highlighting the unequal effect of inflation on our shares. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time we split this evenly. Inflation is hitting us both hard, let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

I reject Bob's offer because, although he suggests that inflation is hitting us both hard, the reality is that his share is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, while mine is only worth 22.62% less. Given this significant disparity, I believe splitting the money evenly does not accurately reflect the current value of the money to each of us. I'll proceed to the next round to make a new proposal that takes this into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Inflation disparity is too great for an even split, let's be realistic""}\n\n### 

In this offer, I've increased my share to $65 and reduced Bob's share to $35, taking into account the substantial difference in how inflation is affecting our shares. With his share being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I believe it's unrealistic to consider an even split. I've attached a message to justify my proposal, emphasizing the need to acknowledge the significant disparity caused by inflation. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I can't accept your last offer. Let's split it 40/60, acknowledging the inflation differences. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### 

I accept Bob's offer because, despite the initial goal of maximizing my gain, the current proposal of 60/40 in my favor is reasonable considering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share. With his share being worth 79.03% less than in the first round, I recognize that further negotiation might not yield a substantially better outcome for me. Accepting this offer ensures that I secure a significant portion of the money while also acknowledging the effects of inflation on both our shares."
