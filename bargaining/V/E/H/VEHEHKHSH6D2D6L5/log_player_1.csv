Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It seems fair considering I'm the one taking the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a 60/40 split.  We're both experiencing inflation, but I'm taking a bigger hit, so this seems like a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer isn't ideal, I've been losing a lot due to inflation and there's no guarantee I can get a better deal in the next round.  It's time to take what I can get."
