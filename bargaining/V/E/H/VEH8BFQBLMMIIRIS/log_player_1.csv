I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer.  I'm taking the lion's share, but I'm giving Bob something to consider.  I figure he'll either accept, or we'll get to see how his valuation of money changes as the rounds go on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52.5 
# Bob gain: 47.5 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds.  He's already shown he's willing to negotiate, and the inflation means the value of his gains is decreasing."
