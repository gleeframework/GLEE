Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything this round, but I'll see how things go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing later on, even with the inflation."
