"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and take $6000 for myself, with a message suggesting this is a fair division. Since Bob loses more value each round due to inflation, he might be inclined to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, accepting $4000 in the second round (which is worth 5% less than the original amount) seems less favorable compared to the potential gain if I can negotiate a better split in the next round. Additionally, Bob's suggestion of a more even split doesn't account for the disproportionate effect of inflation on his share, which could be leveraged to negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4500 and take $5500 for myself, pointing out that considering the inflation rates (5% for me and 20% for Bob), this offer is more than fair. The idea is to acknowledge the impact of inflation on both our parts while still trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept, given the decreasing value of the money for both of us, but more significantly for him."
