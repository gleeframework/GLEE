"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's end this game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll see the value in ending the game quickly and accepting my offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority of the cash! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me a gain of $100,000, which is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and let's split the difference!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced solution that gives Bob a decent share, but also ensures I get a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take 70% of the loot! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll!

I'm not thrilled about giving up 70% of the remaining amount, but I'm also not eager to risk waiting for another round and losing even more value.

Considering the current offer, I'll accept Bob's proposal.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
