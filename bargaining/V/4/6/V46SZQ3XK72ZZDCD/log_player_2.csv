"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  You get a small portion, but we both get something! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's better to try and get a larger share since the money depreciates faster for Alice.  Rejecting forces Alice to make a better offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""This is a fairer split considering the value of the money decreases faster for you.  Let's end this quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still losing value faster. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still trying to get a much larger share. I'm still going to reject and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""This is a fair compromise given our differing inflation rates. Let's avoid further losses and end this round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing too much value now. Let's split it evenly and be done with this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. Alice is losing value much faster than I am, and an even split is a good outcome. There's not much point in risking further losses to try and get a slightly better deal."
