"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand there's inflation, but your initial offer was heavily skewed. Let's be reasonable. This offer gives you a good share considering it's only going to decrease in value for you. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
