{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""I understand there's inflation, but your initial offer was heavily skewed. Let's be reasonable. This offer gives you a good share considering it's only going to decrease in value for you.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share than 350,000.  This offer is more balanced, given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000
