"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation disadvantage you'll face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation disadvantage I'll face in the next round, Bob's offer seems reasonable. I'll accept his proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
