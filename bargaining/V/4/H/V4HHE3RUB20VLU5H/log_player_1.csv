"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, my gain of $200,000 is actually worth $190,000 in terms of the original value.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I was hoping to get a larger share. I'll reject the offer for now.

I'll accept the offer, as it's a decent split and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values due to inflation.
