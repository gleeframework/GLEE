# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one. While I could be stubborn and hope Bob gets desperate enough to accept a worse deal, there's a real risk we both walk away with nothing. 50/50 is fair, and it guarantees I get something.  It's better to take the sure thing now than risk losing everything."
