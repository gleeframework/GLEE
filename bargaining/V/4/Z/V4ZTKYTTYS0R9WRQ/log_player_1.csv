"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll get $500,000 and Bob will get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but still a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 5% decrease in value, but I'm willing to consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take Bob's offer and get $450,000. It's not the best deal, but it's better than going to the next round and risking further erosion of the value due to inflation."
