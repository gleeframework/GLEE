30.0,70.0,"Alice, we're nearing the end of this game.  Inflation is hurting your share of the money more and more with each round. I believe a split of 70/30,  given the current circumstances,  is the most equitable solution to ensure we both get something before the value of the money dwindles further. Let's end this on a positive note.",Bob,6,
