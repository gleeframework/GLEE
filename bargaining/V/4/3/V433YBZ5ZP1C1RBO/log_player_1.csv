"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but still leave you with a decent amount""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$, which is 60, and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively fair split, considering I'm the one making the initial offer."
