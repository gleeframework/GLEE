Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm going to take almost everything, just in case the inflation hits him harder than it hits me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the 500,000. Even with the 20% inflation, it's better than getting nothing if I reject and he rejects my next offer."
