Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not falling for the 'this is my final offer' trick. I think you'll still prefer something over nothing. Let's split it 55-45. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting very risky to keep rejecting, and with each round, the value of the money I'm gaining keeps decreasing. While I'm not happy with the 55-45 split, it's better than getting nothing at this point."
