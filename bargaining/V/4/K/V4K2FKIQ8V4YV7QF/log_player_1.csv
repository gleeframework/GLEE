"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80, you take 20. Let's move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving up too much yet. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the offer.

I'm not too excited about this offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to think about the relative value of the money.

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm increasing my share to 85, but I'm still willing to compromise. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, so I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Considering the offer, I think 60 is a bit too low for me, given the current value of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get an even larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger risk, but I think I deserve a bigger share. 90 is my minimum.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle and split it 50/50. It's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the money is worth a lot less now!

Considering the offer, I think 50/50 is a reasonable compromise, especially since the value of the money is so low. I'll accept this offer to get a fair share and avoid further negotiations.
