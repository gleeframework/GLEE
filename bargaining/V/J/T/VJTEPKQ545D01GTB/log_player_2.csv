Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I understand you want a fair split, but I need to account for inflation. This offer gives me a slight edge in this round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600, ""alice_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""This offer reflects the urgency inflation imposes. I need to act quickly, and this is my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said your last offer was final, but I'm giving you one more chance 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough spot, but I need to cut my losses.  Alice is clearly holding out for a very favorable deal, and the longer this goes on the less my share is actually worth. Accepting 3800 is much better than risking another round and getting even less."
