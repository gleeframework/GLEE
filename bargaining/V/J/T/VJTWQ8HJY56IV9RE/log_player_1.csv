Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite lopsided. Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a 40/60 split.  This reflects that there's value in reaching an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""Alright, I'm willing to compromise.  I'll take 75% and leave 25% for you. Let's wrap this up before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a 55/45 split, which is more than generous considering the time we've wasted and the value you're losing to inflation. Take the deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's better to accept Bob's offer, as the inflation is starting to take a big bite out of my potential gains. I'll take the 4500, as it's still better than getting nothing by continuing to reject and ending up with a 50/50 split due to the lack of time."
