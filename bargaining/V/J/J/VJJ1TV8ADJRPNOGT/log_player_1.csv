Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and try to take the lion's share.  Since the money is worth less to Bob each round, I'm going to start by taking most of it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
