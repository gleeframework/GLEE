"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I want a bigger share too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and 70/30 is still quite skewed in his favor. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's try 55/45 this time""}

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a decent balance between our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I want to make sure I get a decent amount too! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not satisfied with the offer. Although Bob is giving me a slightly larger share, 75/25 is still a very uneven split. I'll try to negotiate for a more balanced deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 is a fair split""}

I'm trying to find a more balanced solution, proposing a 50/50 split. This way, we both get an equal share of the remaining money."
