Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. Since I'm the first to propose, I'm going to aim for the majority of the money. However, I want to be somewhat fair and give Bob a small share so that he's more likely to accept my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I'm getting less now due to inflation, Bob's offer is still extremely unfair. I'll reject this and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share this time, but still aim for a larger portion for myself. I'll take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000.  With inflation in play, I need to be a bit more generous, but still maintain a substantial advantage."
