Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit unbalanced, don't you think? Let's be more realistic. I propose a 75/25 split for this round. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
