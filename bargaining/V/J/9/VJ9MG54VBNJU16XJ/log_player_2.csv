Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find a compromise. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but we need to be reasonable. This offer is fair considering the inflation and your previous proposal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Bob. Waiting any longer significantly diminishes his potential gains.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation. She's unlikely to offer a significantly better deal in future rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer in the hope of a slightly better deal later is very risky. The potential gain from holding out is far outweighed by the potential loss due to inflation.

While 40% isn't a perfect split, it's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting a much smaller share later."
