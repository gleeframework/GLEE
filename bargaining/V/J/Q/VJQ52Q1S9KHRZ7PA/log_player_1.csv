"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division where I receive $55 and Bob receives $45. I'm hoping this initial offer seems fair enough to Bob, considering we're both trying to maximize our gains but also want to conclude the game without too many rounds to avoid the impact of inflation. The message is friendly and suggests a slight imbalance in my favor, which is a common starting point in negotiations to leave room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be generous. This is the same deal, just reversed. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, accepting $45 now is even less valuable than it would have been in the first round. The principle of the offer is the same as mine initially, but with the roles reversed and after a round of inflation, making it less appealing. I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable division for myself, so I'll proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle, considering inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more conservative offer compared to the first round, taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of the money. By proposing that I take $52 and Bob takes $48, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that might be more acceptable to Bob, given that we've both now seen the impact of rejecting offers and moving into further rounds with decreasing value. The message aims to convey a sense of compromise and awareness of the shrinking value of our potential gains."
