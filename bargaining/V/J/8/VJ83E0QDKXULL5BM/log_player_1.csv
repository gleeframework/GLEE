Let's see if Bob takes this deal. I want to get the majority share, but I also want to make sure he doesn't feel like I'm being too unfair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it is a better deal for me in terms of my absolute gain, I still feel like I can get a better deal if I propose.  Inflation is hurting Bob more than it's hurting me, so I'm hoping to leverage that in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800}
```

I'm going to try and meet in the middle. Bob's offer was close to what I would consider fair, but I think I can still get a slightly better deal.  Since I'm the one making the offer this round, I'll propose something slightly closer to a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is better for me than the last one, considering inflation. I'm willing to accept it.  While I'd prefer a larger share, I don't want to risk further rounds and end up with less."
