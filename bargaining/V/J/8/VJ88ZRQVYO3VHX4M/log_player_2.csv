"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn and the clock is ticking.  I'll be generous but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. I need you to meet me closer to my last offer or we both lose! 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and the inflation is working in Bob's favor.  While this offer is slightly better than the last, Bob can likely hold out for a bit more.  The closer it gets to the final rounds, the more negotiating power Bob has."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is a fair deal. Take it while you still get a good portion.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Bob needs to show some flexibility to entice Alice. Offering 4000 is a slight increase from his previous offer and matches Alice's initial offer in round 1. 
* **Inflation Factor:**  The value of Alice's share is decreasing rapidly. This offer might look appealing given the time pressure.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could hold out for more, there's a risk Alice might get even more desperate and offer less favorable terms later.  This offer balances potential gain with the risk of losing everything."
