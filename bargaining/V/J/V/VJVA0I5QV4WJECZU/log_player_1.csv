"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different split. I think this is fair, considering the money will be worth less each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

I'll reject Bob's offer since it's the same split as my initial offer, and I'm not willing to accept the same terms that I already rejected.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share this time. It's still a good deal for you, and we can try to get to the end of this game.""
}
