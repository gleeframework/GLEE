This is a tough situation, but it's no longer advantageous to keep rejecting. Here's why:

* **Inflation is killing Bob's returns:**  The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round for Bob. Accepting $387,500 now is better than risking an even lower amount in future rounds.
* **Alice is getting greedier:**  Alice knows Bob is getting penalized by inflation. She's using this to her advantage, and her offers are likely to get worse for Bob.

It's painful to accept an offer lower than what was previously rejected, but in this scenario, cutting losses is the most rational decision."
