7500.0,2500.0,I propose dividing the $10000 with a 75/25 split in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair distribution considering the inflation rate.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This accounts for the inflation affecting you more than me. It's a fairer distribution than your previous offer.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,accept
