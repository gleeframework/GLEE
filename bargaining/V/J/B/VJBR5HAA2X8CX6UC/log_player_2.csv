"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. This is a fair start, wouldn't you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer for me! While Alice is losing value faster due to inflation, I'm certain I can get a much better deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer still gives you a good chunk while accounting for the inflation we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split this more evenly. This offer is still in your favor considering the inflation, and it's a better deal than your last proposal. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to sweet-talk me, but this is still not a good deal! While she's right that her offer is better than mine considering the inflation, I'm confident I can get a larger share in the upcoming rounds. The inflation is hurting her more than me, so time is on my side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is hitting you harder than me. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be practical and split it evenly. It's the best we can do at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right. We're both losing money due to the inflation, and while I hoped for a better deal, holding out any longer might leave us both with nothing. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome at this point."
