# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although my share of the money is decreasing faster due to inflation, I think I can still get a better deal than 30-70. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, but it will only get worse for you. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. Although I'm not thrilled with the 35-65 split, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I think it's time to cut my losses and accept the offer. Plus, Bob's message sounds pretty final, so I'm not sure I'd get a better deal if I reject it!"
