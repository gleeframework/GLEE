"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less since the money is worth less to you with each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Don't be greedy, Bob. This is my last offer above 50%.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said that was your last offer above 50%, so I'll take a bit more. Inflation is on my side. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting worse, accepting means I get less than $5000. It's risky, but I'm hoping Bob will start to panic as we get closer to the deadline and the potential of getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Bob. I'm taking a small loss to settle this fairly. Don't push your luck.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  I need to signal I'm willing to compromise but still hold some ground. Offering a slight concession while sounding firm might push Bob to accept before the inflation eats away too much of my potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down. Inflation is really eating into your share now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** The inflation is killing me! While this offer is significantly less than I wanted, it's better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds. Bob seems content to wait me out, and I can't afford to be too greedy anymore."
