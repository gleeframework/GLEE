This is a tough one. I'm facing a difficult choice due to the relentless inflation. While Bob's offer is far from ideal, rejecting it means risking even less in future rounds.  

Let's analyze:

* **Current Offer:** $250,000 is significantly less than what I aimed for, and the inflation has already eaten away a big chunk of its value. 
* **Future Rounds:** There's no guarantee Bob will improve his offer. He seems content to let inflation erode my potential gains, forcing me to accept a smaller share. 

**Conclusion:**  It pains me to accept such an unfair deal, but the risk of getting even less in the next round is too high. I need to cut my losses."
