"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, Alice. I'm trying to get a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 30% is a good deal for me, especially considering the money is worth less with each passing round. I'll try to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. 50/50 seems fair.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, and a 50/50 split seems like a reasonable starting point for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure about 50/50, but 55/45 is a good starting point. Your turn to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but it's a bit better than the 70/30 offer from the previous round. I'll consider it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 45% and hope that I can do better in future rounds."
