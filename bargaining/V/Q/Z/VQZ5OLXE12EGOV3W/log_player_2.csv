Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is severely impacting my share. Let's agree now to minimize losses. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which means time is working in my favor.  While her offer seems larger, the inflation means she's actually getting less and less of the original value. I need to hold out for a much better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Look, I'm being more than fair. Take this deal before inflation shrinks your share even further.  It's a win for you at this point!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand slightly to capitalize on Alice's worsening position. She'll be tempted to take anything over 50% at this stage as the rounds progress.  I'm betting that she'll crack soon and accept a deal that's heavily skewed in my favor."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a final attempt at fairness. Inflation is killing my share. Let's settle. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting desperate, calling this a ""final attempt"" at fairness.  However, that 7500 for her is worth significantly less than it appears. I need to press my advantage while I still can!"

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear you're feeling the pressure.  I'm offering you a lifeline. Take this deal - 3000 is better than nothing, and that's what we both get if we don't agree soon.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing my luck a bit here, going for a 70/30 split. But, Alice's language suggests increasing desperation. She knows the clock is ticking, and her potential gains are shrinking rapidly. This offer is designed to be intimidating but also presents a sense of urgency, hoping she'll panic and accept rather than risk losing everything."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is making this worthless for me. This is a last-ditch effort to get something. Please agree. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a game of chicken, and Alice is about to fly off a cliff. While I'd love to get that 70/30 split, the fact that she's willing to take a deal where she effectively gets almost nothing shows how terrified she is of getting zero. It's risky, but there's a good chance if I push further, she'll be too scared to accept anything but a ludicrously one-sided deal in later rounds.  2000 is guaranteed money, which is better than the risk of getting nothing if she panics."
