"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $70 I'd get is worth less than the $80 I proposed in the first round, so I'm not too thrilled about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Considering the inflation, I'll offer a higher amount to myself to account for the decreasing value of money.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate accelerating, the $55 I'd get is worth even less than the $60 I proposed in the previous round. I'm not sure if it's worth accepting, but it's a relatively close split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the accelerating inflation. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}"
