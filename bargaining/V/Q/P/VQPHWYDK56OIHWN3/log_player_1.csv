"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5263,
""bob_gain"": 4737,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a slightly better deal than you'd get in the next round if you reject this offer and propose an even split.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Understanding Inflation:**  The key is realizing that the value of the money decreases for me (Alice) with each round. This means I need to secure a good portion early on. 
* **Strategic Offer:** I'm aiming for a slightly advantageous split, understanding that Bob also wants to maximize his gain.  
* **Round 2 Projection:** If Bob rejects my offer, he'll propose in Round 2. Assuming he aims for a 50/50 split then, the value will have decreased for me.  My offer in Round 1 is designed to be slightly better than what I'd get in a Round 2 even split.

**Let's see if Bob goes for it!**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share, and we can avoid the inflation penalty. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The money has already lost 5% of its value for me. While Bob's offer is technically an even split of the *nominal* amount, in real terms, I'm getting a slightly worse deal than his initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer means I get to propose in Round 3, but the money will be worth even less to me. There's no guarantee I can secure a better deal from Bob at that point.
* **Fairness:** While I aimed for a slight advantage in Round 1, Bob's offer reflects a genuine attempt at a fair split given the current circumstances. 

It's better to accept a slightly less advantageous offer now than risk further losses due to inflation."
