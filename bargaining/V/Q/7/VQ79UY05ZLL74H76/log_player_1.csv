I'm proposing to take 999,999 dollars and give Bob 1 dollar. This ensures I get the majority of the money, and leaves open the possibility of Bob accepting the offer if he's risk-averse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm offering Bob 100,000 dollars, a significant increase from his previous offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still securing the majority of the money. I believe this is a fair offer that Bob may accept to avoid further rounds and potential further inflation."
