This is a terrible offer! Even though I'm getting $1, I'd rather take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the inflation has hit me hard, this is a much better offer than the first round. I'm getting 100,000, which is a significant amount, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
