"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll consider the proposal.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll compare the absolute values. My gain of 7000 is less than my initial offer of 8000, so I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer, taking into account the inflation and the previous rejections:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... Bob's offer is the same as my offer from Round 3! I'm not sure if Bob is trying to trick me or not. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll accept this offer to avoid further inflation and potential risks.
