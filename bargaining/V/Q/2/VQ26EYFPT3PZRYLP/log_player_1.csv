"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, we both get half. Inflation is a concern, but fairness should come first. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation is heavily skewed against me.  I lose value at twice the rate he does. Accepting an even split now means I'm losing out significantly in the long run. It's worth going another round to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of fairness, but we can't ignore the reality of inflation.  I'm proposing a split that acknowledges the decreasing value of the money over time. This ensures a fairer outcome for both of us.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the impact of inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This split still reflects fairness while acknowledging the devaluation of money over time. 
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Bob's offer in Round 4 is now reasonably close to the split I initially proposed in Round 1, taking into account the inflation. Accepting this offer prevents further losses due to inflation for both of us and secures me a decent share. Holding out for a significantly better deal in future rounds is risky, as Bob's willingness to negotiate might decrease, and the money will continue to lose value."
