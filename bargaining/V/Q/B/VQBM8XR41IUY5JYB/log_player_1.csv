Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch the roles, I think 60-40 is fair, but I'll let you decide. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth less now due to inflation, I need to consider this when making my decision. Given that Bob's offer is the same split as my initial proposal but with the amounts reversed, I'll have to think carefully about it.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm choosing to reject Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Let's see what happens next!"
