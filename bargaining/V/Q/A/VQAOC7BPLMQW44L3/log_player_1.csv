"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll be tempted to take it rather than risk getting nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I was initially aiming for. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000} 
```

Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'm going to make a slightly lower offer than before. This should still be attractive to Bob, as he's already seen that I'm willing to reject offers that are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation. Even though this offer is significantly less than what I initially wanted, it's better than getting nothing in the next round.  The risk of rejecting this offer and ending up with nothing is too high."
