"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This seems fair and avoids any immediate conflict."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer isn't terrible, I'm still losing money relative to the original 50/50 split. I believe I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly to 52, aiming for a more balanced split.  I'm willing to compromise, but I want to ensure I'm getting a fair share, especially with the inflation affecting the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm still losing money relative to the original 50/50 split, the inflation is starting to hurt significantly.  I need to consider getting some money rather than risking getting nothing at all.  This offer isn't terrible, and I'm willing to accept it."
