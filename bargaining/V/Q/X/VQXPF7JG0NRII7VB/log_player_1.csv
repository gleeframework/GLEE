"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial 100$ and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth less now, and Bob's offer is more generous than my initial one.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
