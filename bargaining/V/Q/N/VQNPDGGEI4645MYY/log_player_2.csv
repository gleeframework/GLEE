Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share. But let's be realistic: time is working against us. I'm proposing 56/44 â€“ a slight improvement for me over your offer, but still a decent gain for both considering the inflation. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses!

# Alice gain: 5600
