"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I propose keeping 9000 for myself and giving Bob 1000. This leaves room for negotiation in future rounds, but it still gives me a significant share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic change in the division.  I still have many rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more equitable division this round, considering the effects of inflation. I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but acknowledging Bob's increasing leverage with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable. While I recognize the decreasing value of my share, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5760, ""bob_gain"": 4240}
```

I'm making a final push for a more equitable division, acknowledging both the increasing inflation and Bob's stronger position. This offer demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to secure a significant share of the money."
