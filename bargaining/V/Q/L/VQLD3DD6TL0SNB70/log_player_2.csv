"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, but I'm not willing to meet exactly in the middle. How about 58-42? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging while her position weakens significantly each round.  We can likely get a better deal by continuing to wait."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Time is money Alice, especially for you.  This is my final offer."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** By stating this is my final offer, we increase the pressure on Alice to accept. 
* **Slight Concession:** We're moving closer to her offer, showing a willingness to compromise, but not by much.
* **Time Sensitivity:** We're reminding Alice again that waiting hurts her more than it hurts us. 

If Alice rejects this offer, we'll need to seriously consider accepting whatever she proposes in the next round, even if it's slightly worse than this, as the inflation will start to significantly impact our potential gains."
