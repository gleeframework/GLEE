This is a very uneven offer, and with only 12 rounds to go, I'm going to try to negotiate a more equitable split.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair 50/50 split.  I'm hoping Alice will see the benefit of a quick resolution."
