"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 30, and I'll take 70. No need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's share it equally 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to reassess the offer.

I was initially thinking of getting 70, but now I'd be getting 56 (70 * 0.8). And Bob's offer of 50 is now worth 47.5 (50 * 0.95) for me.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
