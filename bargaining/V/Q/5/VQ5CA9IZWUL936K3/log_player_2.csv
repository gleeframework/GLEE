**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. While the offers seem to improve from my perspective, they are still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show I'm serious about a fairer split and willing to risk it all to get it."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous.  We're both running out of time.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Don't let greed make us both losers.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. The inflation is steadily eroding my potential gains, and Alice seems content to let this happen. By proposing a 50/50 split, I'm demonstrating that I'm serious about a fair deal and willing to walk away if necessary.  This leaves the ball firmly in her court and forces her to make a decision: accept a fair deal or risk getting nothing at all as we run out of rounds."
