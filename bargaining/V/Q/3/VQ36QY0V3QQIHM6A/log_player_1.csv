"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us both a decent amount of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
