"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's be realistic! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $570,000 (95% of $600,000)
* Bob gain: $700,000 (same as before)

I'm not thrilled with the new offer, but I'll consider it. Since Bob is gaining more than me, I'll have to think carefully. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a 42-58 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to get a decent share. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too greedy, meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $537,000 (85.74% of $630,000, which is 1,000,000 * 0.95^3)
* Bob gain: $550,000 (same as before)

I'm starting to get a bit desperate, but I still don't want to give up too much. Meeting in the middle at 45-55 is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept this offer.
