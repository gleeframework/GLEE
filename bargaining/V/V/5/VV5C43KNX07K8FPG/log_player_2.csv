"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair start.  I'm willing to share, but let's be realistic. I'll take the larger share since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I think we can find a more equitable split. Let's shoot for a 55/45 split in my favor this round.  With inflation eating away at the pot, it's important to reach a deal quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise further to reach an agreement. Let's split the money 60/40 in my favor.  This offer reflects the fact that I made the first proposal, but also acknowledges the need for a quick resolution. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, and the longer we wait, the less money we both get. Accepting ensures a decent payout even with the inflation.
