"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, no more negotiations! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's $4500. Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 95% of its original value, so it's $4750.

I'm not sure if I like this offer, as Bob's gain is still a bit higher than mine, considering the inflation. I'd rather negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 55-45!""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a bit more than 50%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a little more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $4500 is worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%). So, it's $4500 * 0.729 = $3279.

Bob's gain of $5500 is worth 85.74% of its original value (100% - 14.26% = 85.74%). So, it's $5500 * 0.8574 = $4723.70.

I'm not happy with this offer, as Bob's gain is still higher than mine, and the difference is even larger than before.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Let's make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Compromise, let's try 52-48!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than 50%, but I'm giving Bob a decent share as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up yet! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $4800 is worth 59.05% of its original value (100% - 40.95% = 59.05%). So, it's $4800 * 0.5905 = $2838.

Bob's gain of $5200 is worth 77.38% of its original value (100% - 22.62% = 77.38%). So, it's $5200 * 0.7738 = $4022.64.

I'm not happy with this offer, as Bob's gain is still higher than mine, and the difference is even larger than before.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,

}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob in the middle and split the money evenly, as he suggested in round 2."
