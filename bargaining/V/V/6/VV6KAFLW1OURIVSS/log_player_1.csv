"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a reasonable starting point for negotiations. The message is brief and attempts to set a tone of fairness, hoping Bob might find it acceptable to end the game early. Given the inflation mechanic affecting only my side, there's an incentive to conclude the game as soon as possible to maximize my gain. This initial offer tests Bob's willingness to accept a deal that slightly favors me, considering the pressure of future rounds reducing the value of the money for me but not for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both have a stake in this. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation reducing the value of the money for me, accepting a 55-45 split in his favor after initially proposing a 60-40 split in my favor would be a significant concession too early in the game. Given that we have multiple rounds left and the fact that Bob is not affected by inflation, I believe there's room for further negotiation to find a more favorable or balanced split. By rejecting this offer, I aim to pressure Bob into reconsidering or to create an opportunity for a counteroffer that could be more advantageous or closer to the original proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's meet halfway between our offers""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm making a concession by reducing my initial 60% demand to 58%, effectively meeting halfway between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer of a 55-45 split. This gesture aims to demonstrate a willingness to compromise and negotiate in good faith. By slightly favoring myself still, I'm maintaining a position of strength while trying to appeal to Bob's reasonableness, as he suggested in his message. This approach tests Bob's flexibility and openness to finding a middle ground that could conclude the game to our mutual benefit before the inflation significantly impacts my potential gain."
