Let's see what Alice proposes next!  I'm thinking I can do better."

I'm going for a more even split, but still giving myself a slight advantage. Let's see if Alice agrees!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. Even though I'm getting less than I initially wanted, the inflation is really starting to hurt, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
