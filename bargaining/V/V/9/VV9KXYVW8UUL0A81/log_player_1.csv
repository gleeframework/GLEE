"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the offer is closer to the original 50/50 split, I'll accept it.
