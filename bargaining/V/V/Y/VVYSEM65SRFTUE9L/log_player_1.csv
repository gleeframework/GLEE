"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make the first proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me."

# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'd like to negotiate further. The 60/40 split is a bit too skewed in Bob's favor, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to adjust my proposal. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."

# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to bite! 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not happy with the 65/35 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing for me. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is getting worse! 

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll try to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm trying to take advantage of the situation and get a better deal for myself, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of my potential gains!

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not happy with the 30/70 split, especially considering the significant reduction in the value of my potential earnings. I'd like to try to get a better deal, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'm getting desperate!

Considering the extremely low value of the money due to inflation, I'll try to make a last-ditch effort to get a decent deal. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500
}

I'm taking a risk by offering a slightly higher amount to me, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it before the value of the money drops even further."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting!

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'm afraid I have no choice but to accept Bob's offer. The value of the money is so low now that I'd rather take what I can get, even if it's a bad deal. I'm willing to settle for a 25/75 split rather than risk waiting for an even worse deal."
