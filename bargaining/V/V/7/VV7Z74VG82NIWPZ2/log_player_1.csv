"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going for a big chunk of the money in the first round, hoping Bob will want to avoid the risk of losing a lot in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'm getting less than I wanted, the inflation will hurt Bob more than me in the next round, making it risky for him to reject."
