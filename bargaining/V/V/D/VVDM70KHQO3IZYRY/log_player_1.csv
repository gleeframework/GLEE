I'm going for a large share, but still offering a small amount to Bob to hopefully get him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very greedy! I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000} 
```

This offer is more balanced than Bob's, and I'm hoping he'll realize that if he rejects it, he'll have to offer me an even larger share in the next round."
