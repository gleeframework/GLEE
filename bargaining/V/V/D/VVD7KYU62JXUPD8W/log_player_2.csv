"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a simple offer. I take $700,000, you take $300,000.  It's in your best interest to settle quickly before inflation eats away at your share. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit lopsided.  Let's be fairer and split the difference more evenly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that was a shrewd offer, but remember inflation is working against you. I'm proposing $650,000 for me and $350,000 for you.  Let's settle this now and both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is better than Alice's first one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more the shrinking pot will push her to make a more agreeable offer.  I'm willing to gamble one more round to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want a sizable share.  This offer reflects the time pressure we're both under. Let's be reasonable and close this out.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the negotiation, but time is literally money in this game. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle with $625,000 for me and $375,000 for you. This is a fair deal considering the inflation working against you.  Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 375000 
# Alice gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this. Accepting this offer nets me $375,000. Rejecting it means gambling on getting a better offer in Round 6 when inflation will have eroded the value even further. The risk outweighs the potential reward at this point."
