"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This is a pretty good split, considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate and the money will be worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity, but I believe we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob wants to split it more evenly, but I notice that he's still trying to get more than me! I'm not going to fall for that. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast, Bob! I'm not willing to give you the majority of the money just yet. Let's keep negotiating.""
}
```

I'll stick to my original proposal, but with the updated value due to inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll propose:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 504000,
  ""bob_gain"": 496000,
  ""message"": ""I'll stick with my original idea, but with a slight adjustment for inflation. Will you reconsider?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less again, so I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 441600,
  ""bob_gain"": 558400,
  ""message"": ""I'm still holding firm on my original idea, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Will you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
