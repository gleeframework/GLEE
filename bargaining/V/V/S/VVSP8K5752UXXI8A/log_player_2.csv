"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, I'm generous! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it's a fair split, the inflation means I'll be losing more money the longer we go on, and there's a chance I can get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money more in my favor, since I'm taking the risk of waiting.  Let's see if you agree.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55% is a fairer split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This seems like a fair deal, considering the inflation affecting Alice. It's better than the initial offer and gives me a decent amount."
