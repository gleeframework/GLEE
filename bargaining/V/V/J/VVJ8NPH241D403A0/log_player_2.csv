"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to account for the fact that the money loses value for me over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The 60/40 split doesn't seem fair to me, considering the money loses value for me over time, not Alice. I'd like to propose a different split in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll propose a 55/45 split in my favor to account for the inflation that affects me. Let's see if Alice accepts this offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a negotiation. I'm willing to come down a little, but 55/45 is too low for me. How about 58/42? 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile Alice has come down from her initial 60/40 offer, the 58/42 split still doesn't adequately account for the inflation that affects me. I'll wait for a better offer or propose a different split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll propose a 52/48 split in my favor to account for the increasing inflation that affects me. Let's see if Alice accepts this offer.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and we both lose if this drags on. I'm proposing 57/43. It's a small concession on my part, and it reflects the reality of the situation. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice has made a small concession, the 57/43 split still doesn't adequately account for the increasing inflation that affects me. With the money losing 18.55% of its value for me, I'm willing to take the risk and propose a different split in the next round, hoping for a better outcome."
