"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly""}\n\n###\nI hope this offer is acceptable to Bob. If not, I'm ready to negotiate further, keeping in mind the impact of inflation on our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  This is a bit more in my favor, but remember the money shrinks next round! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, considering the impact of inflation. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round, hoping to secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a reasonable adjustment""}\n\n###\nI've taken into account the decrease in value due to inflation and adjusted my offer accordingly. I believe this is a fair proposal, given the current circumstances. Hopefully, Bob will see it the same way and we can conclude the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think accepting Bob's offer of an even split is the best decision at this point. Further negotiations would only lead to less valuable outcomes for both of us. It's time to secure what's left and conclude the game."
