Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is going to keep dragging if we aren't closer. I'm taking a hit from inflation, how about a 51/49 split? 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
