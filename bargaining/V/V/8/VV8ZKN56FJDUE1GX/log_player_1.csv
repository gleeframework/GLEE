Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split is more in line with a fair outcome.  Time is money after all. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
