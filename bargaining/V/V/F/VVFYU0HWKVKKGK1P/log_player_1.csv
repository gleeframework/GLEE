"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the effects of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering a 50-50 split, I'm not sure if I should accept it. But considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I think I should take what I can get.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
