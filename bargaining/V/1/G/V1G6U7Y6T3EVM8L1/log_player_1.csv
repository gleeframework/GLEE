I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would prefer more, it's getting risky to keep rejecting offers. With inflation, I'm losing more than Bob each round.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's still a decent amount compared to what I'd likely get if we keep going."
