"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25/75, I'll try to counter with a 60/40 split, which is a bit more favorable to me. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Alice's offer is now 50/50, I'll accept it to avoid further rounds and potential even worse offers due to inflation. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
