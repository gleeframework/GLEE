Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, giving myself a larger share. This is to see how Bob reacts and how much he values the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation is making each round more risky. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, and I don't want to risk getting less in the future."
