Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's split it 65/35 this time.  It's a good deal for both of us, and we can avoid further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering a more ""even"" split, it's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, *especially* for Alice. It's still beneficial for me to hold out for a better deal in the hopes that she becomes more amenable to a larger percentage for me as the rounds progress."

Round 4

{

""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and the money is losing value fast.  70/30 is my final offer.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every round.  Let's cut our losses and split it evenly.  It's the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point. The value of the money is decreasing significantly each round, and a 50/50 split is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
