"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
 
I propose a 95/5 split in my favor.  This is a fair initial offer considering the risk of inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even with the 5% inflation. I'll reject it and try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to offer a more balanced split of 80/20 in my favor.  This is still a good deal for me, but it shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my previous offer, even considering the inflation. I'll reject it and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer a more balanced split of 70/30 in my favor. This is still a good deal for me, but it shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully encourages Bob to accept, especially with the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, Bob's offer is a fair 50/50 split. It's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
