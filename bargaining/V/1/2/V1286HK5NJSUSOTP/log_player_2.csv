I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  While it's a decent starting point, I know that the money is worth less with each round, and I'm confident I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more fair split, considering the money will depreciate with each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept Alice's offer. Although the money is depreciating, I'm not confident I can get a better deal, and this is a reasonable split."
