Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's not sustainable for me in the long run.  I propose we split the money 60/40,  which is still a significant gain for both of us. This way, we can both maximize our earnings before inflation erodes our profits too drastically. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
