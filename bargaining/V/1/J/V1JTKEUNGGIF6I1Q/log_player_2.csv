Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a 60/40 split in favor of you, Bob. This might seem like a generous offer considering the risk of inflation and the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I believe a 54/46 split would be fair. This maintains a reasonable balance while acknowledging the diminishing value of money in each subsequent round. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54
