"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game progresses. Alice is undervaluing the impact of inflation on her end."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Your share loses value much faster than mine, Alice. Let's be a bit more realistic. This offer is valid only for this round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation disparity, but I need a better deal to agree. This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still undervaluing the speed at which the money is losing value for her. I need to make the impact of her declining buying power even clearer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, every round you wait is a massively bad deal for you.  I'm offering you a larger share than you'd get if you waited just *one* more round to accept my previous offer. This is your last chance for a decent cut.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise, but it has to be a fair deal.  This is lower than my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it needs to make sense for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a critical moment. Alice is finally acknowledging the need for compromise, but she's still not fully grasping the speed at which her position is weakening. We need to make her see that her offers are getting worse for her, not better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6200,
""alice_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Alice, that last offer was actually WORSE for you than my previous one, even though you got less!  The clock is ticking VERY loudly on your share. I'm still willing to make a deal, but we're running out of time.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money.  Let's stop wasting time and split it evenly. This is the fairest option, and we're running out of rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is a tough decision, but accepting is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the risk of walking away with nothing is very real. Alice is unlikely to offer anything significantly better at this stage.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While the 50/50 split isn't ideal, the impact of inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money, especially for Alice. Waiting longer will likely result in offers that are worse than what we have now.
* **Fairness Appeal:** Alice is playing on the sense of fairness, and while it's a tactic, it's not entirely unreasonable at this juncture. Accepting a reasonable offer prevents us from appearing overly greedy and potentially sabotaging the whole deal. 

It's a gamble to accept, but the odds of getting a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds are slim."
