"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not sure if I want to accept it. Considering the inflation, $20 is actually worth $16 (80% of the original $20). Still, it's not a bad offer, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give Bob such a large share.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 80-20, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a bit too greedy, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. Don't expect much! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is quite harsh! With inflation, the $10 I'd gain is actually worth around $4.88 (48.8% of the original $10). That's a pretty small share.

I'll reject Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob! Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30-70 split, which is a bit more in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, Alice. Don't expect any mercy! 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's getting ruthless! With inflation, the $5 I'd gain is actually worth around $1.38 (67.23% of the original $5). That's an incredibly small share.

I'll reject Bob's offer, hoping to get a slightly better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I'll try to make a more desperate offer. Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! Meet me halfway!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 25-75 split, which is a bit more in my favor. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're almost out of time, Alice. Don't bother making another offer! 
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $2 I'd gain is actually worth around $0.40 (79.03% of the original $2). That's an incredibly small share.

I'll reject Bob's offer, but I'm starting to think I'm running out of options. I'll have to think carefully about my next move.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a very last-ditch effort to get a better deal. With the value of money dwindling rapidly, I'll propose a very small share for Bob, hoping he'll accept it. Here's my offer for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1,
  ""bob_gain"": 99,
  ""message"": ""You're getting the lion's share, Bob. Don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 1-99 split, which is essentially giving Bob almost all the money. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking it all! You're out of options, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 100 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is taking a firm stance. With inflation, the value of the money is dwindling rapidly, and I'm left with almost nothing.

I'll reject Bob's offer, but I'm not sure what else I can do at this point.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm starting to think I might be stuck with nothing..."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm running out of options, and the value of the money is almost negligible at this point. I'll make one final offer, but it's essentially a token gesture.

Here's my offer for Round 11:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 0.01,
  ""bob_gain"": 99.99,
  ""message"": ""Fine, take it all. I'm out of time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 0.01-99.99 split, which is essentially giving Bob everything. I'm not expecting much at this point."
