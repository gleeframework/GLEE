"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the bigger share, but you get something to begin with. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take something, it's early in the game.  I want to see if I can get a better deal later on, especially since inflation might be working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly.  It's the most logical way to start.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it closer to what I proposed in the first round, but with a little less for me to account for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is getting increasingly greedy! I'm hoping that by rejecting her offer, she'll eventually come to a more reasonable compromise.  The inflation is working in my favor, so I'm going to try to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to let you take the majority.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.""}
