"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, and inviting Bob to make a proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer and decide whether to accept or reject.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the nominal values. I'll gain $4,000, which is less than my initial offer of $5,000.

However, I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a better deal than my initial proposal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a lower potential gain.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
