"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you $100,000 and take the rest. It's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to get Bob to accept the offer quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving you all the money! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less for Bob, but I'll still consider the offer.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $200,000 and Bob will take $800,000."
