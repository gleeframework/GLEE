I propose a 9000/1000 split, favoring myself as the first mover.  I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering a 8000/2000 split in my favor.  While I lost 10% of my share due to inflation, I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting something now rather than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'm getting much less than I initially hoped for,  I'm losing a significant portion of my share with each passing round. Accepting now is better than risking getting nothing at all."
