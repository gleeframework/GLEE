Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I think I can squeeze out a bit more. You're getting a good deal, but I need to get a better share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation is eating away at the money quickly. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get a decent share before the value drops further."
