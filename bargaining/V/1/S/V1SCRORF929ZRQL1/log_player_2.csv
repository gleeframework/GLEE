This is a tough spot, but accepting such a low offer sets a bad precedent and Alice is likely to keep lowballing.  I'm betting she'll be more reasonable in the next round."

This is a painful decision, but with the rapid inflation, it's the best I can hope for at this point. If I reject this, Alice is likely to offer even less in the next round, and I'll be losing even more value."
