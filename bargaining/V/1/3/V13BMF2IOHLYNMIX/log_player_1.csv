Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the bigger share this time. It's a fair deal, and with the money losing value every round, it's the best option for us both. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
