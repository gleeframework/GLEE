"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal Bob. This offer won't be as good for me later. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  Even though this offer is good for me now, it will be worth less to Alice in the next round, so she may be more inclined to give me a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the bigger share this time. It's a fair deal, and with the money losing value every round, it's the best option for us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it before inflation eats away at the value even more. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Alice's offer is not ideal, it's better than the 19% loss I'd face if we continue to the next round. I'm going to take it."
