"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, considering the starting amount of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll be getting $300,000, which is equivalent to $300,000 / 0.9 = $333,333 in the original value.

As for Bob's gain, it's worth 5% less, so he's getting $700,000, which is equivalent to $700,000 / 0.95 = $736,842 in the original value.

Considering the offers, I'll decide to reject this offer as well.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation again, I'll make a new offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000 and keeping $420,000 for myself."
