"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split in my favor. I'm aiming for a large share, but I'm still leaving a significant amount for Bob. This is a strong starting point that I hope will encourage him to accept, avoiding the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is significant, Bob's offer is still far too unfavorable. My share has dropped drastically from the previous round, and even with the inflation, I believe I can still secure a more equitable split. I'll counter with a proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering 700,000 for myself and 300,000 for Bob. This is a compromise, considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer. I believe this is fair and will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but given the significant inflation, I have to accept. My share has decreased significantly, but at least I'm getting something. I'm taking a gamble that the inflation will continue to hurt Bob more than me in the following rounds, and I might be able to negotiate a better deal later."
