"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but I'm trying to be fair by giving Bob a reasonable share. I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal that benefits me more, but still provides him with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. It's not fair to me. While the money is worth less for me due to inflation, I am still willing to negotiate a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my offer for Bob slightly, but still keeping a larger share for myself. The inflation is starting to have an effect, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal than Bob's previous offer."
