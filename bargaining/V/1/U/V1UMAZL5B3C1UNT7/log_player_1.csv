"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, don't you? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's end this Bob. This is the same deal you offered me, but fairer since the value decreases for me each round.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, and inflation isn't affecting me. Let's settle this. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is correct that inflation doesn't affect him, I need to be very mindful of it. Accepting $3500 now is a significant loss compared to what I could have gained earlier.  Bob is clearly trying to take advantage, and I need to hold out for a better offer, even if it means risking going further down the line with inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a significant hit from inflation.  You got greedy, and now I'm forced to accept a worse deal.  Let's end this here, or we'll both lose out.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I've got the upper hand here. Inflation is really hurting you, isn't it? 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is painful, but I need to cut my losses. Accepting $2500 is terrible compared to my initial offers, but if I reject this, there's a very real chance I'll end up with even less in the next round. Bob is exploiting the situation, but I need to be realistic about the impact of inflation."
