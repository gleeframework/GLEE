I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, considering I'm the one making the offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. 300,000 is a much lower share than I was hoping for, even with the inflation consideration. I'm still confident I can get a better deal. Let's see what I can propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a generous offer, considering the inflation that has taken place. I hope Bob will be more reasonable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While he is clearly trying to get a better deal for himself, I'm still convinced that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to negotiate further, but this offer is simply too low."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time, I'm going for a 50/50 split.  The inflation is getting serious, and I think it's time to compromise and find a fair solution. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a good opportunity to avoid further losses."
