"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial 100$ and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll consider the effective value of my gain in this round. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 50$ which is worth 90% of the initial 100$, so effectively I'll get 45$.

Considering the effective value, I think this offer is a bit too close to 50-50, and I'd like to get a slightly better deal. So, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to get a slightly better deal for myself. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining 100$ and leaving 45% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Let's analyze the effective values considering the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll consider the effective value of my gain in this round. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 45$ which is worth 73.9% of the initial 100$, so effectively I'll get 73.9$.

Considering the effective value, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable, and I'm tempted to accept it. However, I'd like to get a slightly better deal if possible. Since Bob's offer is already quite close to 50-50, I'll decide to accept this offer.
