Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is trying to get a much bigger share, but I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my winnings.  I'll counter in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer a compromise this time, hoping to reach an agreement.  Let's see if Bob is willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is still quite unfavorable, and even though I'm not sure how much the inflation is affecting him, I think I can still do better. Let's see if I can get him to budge further in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground while still securing a majority of the money. With each round, the value of Bob's share is decreasing due to inflation, so I'm hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is reasonable. I'm not sure how much longer I can keep rejecting his offers, as inflation will continue to eat away at the value of his offer. It's time to settle for a 50/50 split and end this game."
