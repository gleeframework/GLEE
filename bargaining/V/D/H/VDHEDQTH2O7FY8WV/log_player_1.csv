"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I take 6,000 and Bob takes 4,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but also subtly implying that I'm willing to take the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, and I was hoping to get a better deal. I'm also concerned that Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, which means he's getting a relatively better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a slight improvement from Bob's 50-50 offer. I'm framing it as a compromise, but also implying that I'm willing to give a bit more, but not too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 48-52 split, and I'm concerned that Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means he's getting a relatively better deal. I was hoping for a more significant improvement from the previous offers. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think this is my last offer""}

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which is a slight improvement from Bob's previous offer. I'm framing it as a compromise, but also implying that this is my final offer and I'm not willing to negotiate further."
