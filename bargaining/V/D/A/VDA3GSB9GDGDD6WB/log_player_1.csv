"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair and reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going all the way to 50/50 just yet. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me even less than before. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 20% reduction in value due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to the middle, but I still want a bit more. This is my last offer before I make a stronger move. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up even more. However, I'm not sure if I want to risk pushing him further, as he mentioned this is his ""last offer before a stronger move"". I'll take a cautious approach and accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
