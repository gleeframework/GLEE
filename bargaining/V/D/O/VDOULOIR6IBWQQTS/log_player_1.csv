"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}

I'm going for a very lopsided offer in the first round. I want to see if Bob is greedy or if he's willing to negotiate. I'll keep in mind the inflation factor, but I'm hoping to maximize my gains early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, this is a significant improvement from the previous round.  With inflation, I'm losing 5% of the value of my gains each round, so accepting this offer is the most financially sound decision."
