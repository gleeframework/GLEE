5000.0,5000.0,I think an equal split is the fairest way to start. Let's see if we can agree on that.,Bob,2,
,,"I'll give you 5500, and I'll take 4500. That's a slightly more favorable split for me, but still fair.",Alice,2,reject

,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal than the last round, but I need to get a better return than your previous offer. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",Bob,4,

1000.0,9000.0,"This is my final offer. We are both losing a lot of money with each passing round. I'm willing to give you a small amount, but I need to get the majority of the money to offset the inflation. Let's make a deal before it's too late.",Bob,10,
,,"I'm not willing to accept a 10-90 split. I'll propose a 45-55 split this round, but I'll give you a small concession: I'll give you 1100, and I'll take 8900. It's a last-ditch effort to get a decent deal.",Alice,10,reject
