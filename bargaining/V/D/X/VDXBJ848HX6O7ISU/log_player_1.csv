"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share to start the negotiations. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my share, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I'll consider it a reasonable proposal. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
