Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small portion, hoping he'll accept to avoid risking getting nothing at all in later rounds.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's a fair offer, and I'd rather get half the money than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
