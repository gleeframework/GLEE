"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This means I'm offering to give Bob $2,000 and keep $8,000 for myself. It's a decent starting offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $7,000, which is worth 95% of $7,500 (the original $8,000 I was aiming for in the first round). That's a decent compromise.

I'll accept this offer.
