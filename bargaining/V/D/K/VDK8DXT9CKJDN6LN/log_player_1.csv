"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust as needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move on to the next step."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and start with a 50/50 split. Let's see if we can work from here. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I like the compromise and the 50/50 split is a good starting point. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm willing to take the 50% share and see where we can go from here."
