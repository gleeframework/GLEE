I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, the inflation will hurt me more than Alice. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a more even split, considering inflation will affect us differently. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Adapting for inflation, hoping for a mutual agreement. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'm still losing a bit more to inflation than Alice, it's a better deal than the last round, and we're getting closer to a split that works for both of us.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal before the inflation gets too out of hand."
