"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40 is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my $600,000 in the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'd get $480,000 in the second round if I were to accept this offer. However, Bob's offer is a 70-30 split, which is even more skewed towards him than my initial offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings! Considering the effects of inflation, my $600,000 in the first round is now worth about 40.8% of its original value, so I'd get $246,000 in the fourth round if I were to accept this offer.
