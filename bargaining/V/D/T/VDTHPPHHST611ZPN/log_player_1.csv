"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'll propose a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor. This is a relatively generous offer, as it leaves Bob with a significant amount,  giving me a good chance of getting it accepted in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 

I'll propose a 850,000/150,000 split in my favor.  This is a slightly lower offer than the previous round, but still a significant amount for Bob, and I'm hoping it will incentivize him to accept it.  Since I rejected his offer, he's likely feeling some pressure to make a deal before the value of the money continues to decrease."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is significantly worse than the previous offer, and I'm not willing to accept such a small amount of money, especially since the value continues to decrease.  I'm hoping to get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 750,000/250,000 split in my favor.  This is a further concession from my previous offer, but it's still a sizable amount for Bob. I'm trying to strike a balance between securing a decent amount of money and avoiding further rounds of negotiation where inflation eats away at the value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is still very unfavorable to me, even considering the decreasing value of the money. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if Bob will offer a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 700,000/300,000 split in my favor. It's a slightly lower offer than the previous round, but it's still a significant portion of the money.  I'm trying to get a deal done before the value of the money gets even lower, but I'm also trying to hold out for a reasonable amount."
