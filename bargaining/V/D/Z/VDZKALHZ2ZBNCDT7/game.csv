5250.0,4750.0,"Bob, time is running out and inflation is eating into our potential gains. This offer is a compromise, slightly favoring me to account for the decreasing value of the money I receive with each round.  Let's settle this now and both benefit.",Alice,5,

4000.0,6000.0,"I'm taking a firmer stance now. With inflation eating into your share, I think this split is becoming more reasonable by the round.",Bob,6,

5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but this back and forth is pointless and only hurts us both due to inflation.  I propose an even 50/50 split.  This ensures a fair outcome despite the shrinking pot. Let's be logical and end this here.",Alice,7,
