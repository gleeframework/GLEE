# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I've decided to accept Bob's offer. Although the value of the money has decreased significantly, a 50/50 split is indeed a fair deal. Given the decreasing value and the risk of getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds, I think it's best to accept this offer and ensure I get something.### {""decision"": ""accept""}"
