"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm starting with a fair and equal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly. I'll reject this offer since I'm not getting a fair share considering the reduced value of money.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of my share. Here's my offer for round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58
}

I'm aiming for a slightly higher share to compensate for the reduced value of money."
