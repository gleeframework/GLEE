"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and simple offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're too generous, I'll take this deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more cautious now that Bob has rejected my initial offer.

Considering the inflation, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd rather have a higher amount now than a smaller amount later.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
