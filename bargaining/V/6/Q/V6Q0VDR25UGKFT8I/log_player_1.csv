"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 20%."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a decent share. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 80% of the original $8000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's now worth $6400 in today's money.

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as it's even less favorable to me than the first round. I'll reject it.

# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5500 is worth 68.75% of the original $8000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's now worth $5500 in today's money.

I'm not convinced that this offer is significantly better than my previous one, considering the inflation. I'll reject it.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is worth 62.5% of the original $8000 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's now worth $5000 in today's money.

Considering the significant inflation and the fact that we're already in the 6th round, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept it.
