Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think it's fair to split it 60/40, but I'll take the bigger share this time.  What do you say?""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll take a smaller share this time to avoid further negotiation.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Let's finish this.  While I'm getting less than I proposed, it's still a decent gain after the inflation."
