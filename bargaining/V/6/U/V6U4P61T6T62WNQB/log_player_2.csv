Let's see what Alice offers next.  I'm going to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a deal that's more favorable to me, but still leaves Alice with something. I think this will encourage her to accept, as she knows she'll be able to make a counter offer in the next round if she doesn't like it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 280000 
# Alice gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still significantly worse than the initial proposal. While I understand inflation is a factor, I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm raising my offer again, but still leaving Alice with a decent share. The inflation is starting to bite, and I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 424000 
# Alice gain: 576000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse, but it's still not good enough. I'm holding out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the decreasing rounds.  I'm hoping Alice will realize that the longer we wait, the less valuable the money will become for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 539200 
# Alice gain: 460800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer, but I'm still not willing to accept it.  I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  The inflation is starting to really hurt Alice, and I think I can get her to budge."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of gradually increasing my offer.  I'm confident that this is the sweet spot for Alice - she'll get a decent amount, but it's still a lot less than what she was initially offered.  Plus, the inflation is really starting to hurt her now, so she may be more willing to accept a deal that's less than ideal."
