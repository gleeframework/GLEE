"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit less to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob. My message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, but I think a more even split is possible. Let's try 60/40 this time. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to get a more even split, but I'm not convinced it's in my favor. Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'd like to make a counteroffer to ensure I get a larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the suggestion, but I'd like to try to get a bit more considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and passing the baton to him to make another proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer needs to account for the reduced value of money. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll try to find a sweet spot, let's see if this works for you.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55 dollars, which is a bit more than my initial offer, but still considering the reduced value of money due to inflation."
