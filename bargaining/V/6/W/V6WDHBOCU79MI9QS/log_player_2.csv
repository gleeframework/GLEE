"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Determine the adjusted value of the money after one round.
Since the money is worth 20% less for me (Bob) with each passing round, after one round, the $100 is now worth $80 to me.

### Step 2: Calculate the offer that would give me more than the adjusted value if split equally.
If we were to split the $100 equally as Alice suggested, I would get $50, but due to inflation, it's worth only $40 to me. I want to propose an offer where I get more than $50 to compensate for the inflation.

### Step 3: Decide on the offer.
Considering the inflation and wanting to end the game quickly to avoid further devaluation, I will propose an offer where I get slightly more than half to compensate for the inflation, but still reasonable enough for Alice to consider.

### Step 4: Formulate the offer in the required JSON format.
Given the considerations above, I propose the following division:

```
{
""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split slightly in my favor.""
}
```

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 55,""alice_gain"": 45,""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split slightly in my favor.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Since you rejected my fair offer, I'm also adjusting the split. Let's see how you like it. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Alice's offer considering the current inflation.
Alice is offering me $45, but due to the inflation, which has increased to 36% less value for me, I need to calculate the real value of this offer to me.

### Step 2: Calculate the real value of Alice's offer after inflation.
The real value of $45 after a 36% reduction is $45 * (1 - 0.36) = $45 * 0.64 = $28.80.

### Step 3: Compare the real value with what I would have gotten if I accepted the first offer.
Initially, Alice offered $50, which, if accepted in the first round, would have been worth $50 to me. Now, with the inflation, her offer of $45 is worth significantly less.

### Step 4: Decide whether to accept or reject Alice's offer based on the calculations.
Given that the offer's value has decreased significantly due to inflation, and considering I initially rejected an offer that would have given me more value ($50), I should try to negotiate for a better deal.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Reassess the situation and adjust for inflation.
Given that the money is now worth even less to me due to increased inflation (36% less), I need to adjust my offer to ensure I get a fair share considering the devaluation.

### Step 2: Calculate the minimum I should aim for to compensate for the inflation.
Since the original $100 is now worth significantly less, aiming for more than half of the original amount is reasonable to compensate for the loss in value.

### Step 3: Decide on a new offer.
To make the deal attractive to Alice while compensating for the loss in value due to inflation, I will propose an offer where I get a larger share but still leave a significant amount for Alice.

### Step 4: Formulate the new offer in the required JSON format.
Given the considerations above, I propose the following division:

```
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""With increasing inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. This is my new offer.""
}
```

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 60,""alice_gain"": 40,""message"": ""With increasing inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. This is my new offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging from my previous offer. It's your turn to adjust. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Alice's offer considering the current inflation.
Alice is still offering me $40, but due to the inflation, which has increased to 59.04% less value for me, I need to calculate the real value of this offer to me.

### Step 2: Calculate the real value of Alice's offer after inflation.
The real value of $40 after a 59.04% reduction is $40 * (1 - 0.5904) = $40 * 0.4096 = $16.384.

### Step 3: Compare the real value with what I would have gotten if I accepted the first offer.
Initially, Alice offered $50, which, if accepted in the first round, would have been worth $50 to me. Now, with the inflation, her offer of $40 is worth significantly less.

### Step 4: Decide whether to accept or reject Alice's offer based on the calculations.
Given that the offer's value has decreased drastically due to inflation, and considering I initially rejected an offer that would have given me more value ($50), accepting this offer might be the best option to avoid further devaluation in the next rounds.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
