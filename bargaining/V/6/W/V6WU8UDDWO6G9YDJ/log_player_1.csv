Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While I rejected Bob's offer in round 2 where he took a larger share, the value of the money is decreasing for him with each round. He's now willing to split evenly. Accepting this offer guarantees me a fair share, and continuing to haggle risks him offering even less in future rounds as the money is worth less to him."
