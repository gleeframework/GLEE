"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take the smaller share and we can negotiate more in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share in the first round to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $5700.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept the offer for now, hoping to negotiate better terms in future rounds.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
