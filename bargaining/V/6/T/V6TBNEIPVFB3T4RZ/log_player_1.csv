"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's try a split that's a bit more even. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the new values are:

* My gain: $4500 (worth 5% less than $6000)
* Bob's gain: $5500 (worth 10% less than $6000)

I think Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn!""
