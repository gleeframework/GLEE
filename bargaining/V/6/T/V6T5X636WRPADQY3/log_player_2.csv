"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 700000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still willing to share, but I need a bigger chunk to make it worthwhile for me.  60/40 is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The inflation is working in my favor, and she's feeling the pressure. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real, the clock is ticking. I'm offering you a generous 40%. Take it before inflation eats away even more."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

I'm flipping the script here. I'm now offering Alice what she offered me, making it clear that time is on my side. With each round, the deal gets worse for her, not me. This adds pressure and makes my offer seem more appealing."
