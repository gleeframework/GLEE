Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 6000 for me and 4000 for you is a fair starting point.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
