"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! Given the significant difference in the proposed split, I'll have to think carefully. However, I don't want to give away too much of the pie, especially with inflation reducing the value of the money.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in the first round. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering a 60/40 split, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is dropping rapidly! Given the significant difference in the proposed split, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or risk waiting for a better deal.

However, considering the diminishing value of the money, I think I should prioritize getting something rather than risking getting nothing. I'll accept this offer.
