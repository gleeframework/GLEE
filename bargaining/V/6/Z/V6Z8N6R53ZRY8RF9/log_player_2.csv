Let's see if I can do better!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm aiming for a slightly larger share, but I want to make sure Alice has a decent portion as well to incentivize her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is lower than her previous offer, even accounting for inflation. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but I'm still leaving a good portion for Alice.  I hope this will be more appealing to her than the previous rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm pushing for a larger share, but I'm still leaving Alice a significant amount.  With each round, the money is worth less, so I need to be more aggressive to get a decent share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is now a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the significant inflation. Accepting this means we both get a decent share, and the risk of getting nothing is too high if we continue to reject offers."
