"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

This is a 7:3 split in my favor, but I'm offering Bob a decent chunk of money to try to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are now:

* My gain of 5000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round (due to 20% less)
* Bob's gain of 5000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round (due to 5% less)

I'll take the safer option. I accept the offer.
