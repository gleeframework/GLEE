"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the new total is $8,000.

{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Alice's offer is the same as mine in round 2, but with the correct calculation for the reduced value due to inflation.

Since the money is worth 36% less than the original $10,000, the new total is $6,400.

I'll reject this offer since it's the same as my previous offer, and I'm hoping for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 36% less than the original $10,000, the new total is $6,400. But since we are still dividing the original $10,000, I'll make an offer based on that.
