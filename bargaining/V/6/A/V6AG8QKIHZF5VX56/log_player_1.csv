"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large majority of the money, but I believe it's fair enough to incentivize Bob to accept, especially since he'll be getting a larger percentage in the next round due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer gives me a small amount, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. Since Bob's share is worth less with each round due to inflation, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This offer gives me a larger share than Bob's previous offer while still leaving him with a significant portion.  The inflation is working against both of us, so this should incentivize Bob to accept before the money becomes even less valuable for him."
