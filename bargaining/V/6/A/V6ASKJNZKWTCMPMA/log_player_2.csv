Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is only hurting you, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my impatience with inflation. While the deal is getting worse with each round, accepting this offer would mean I lose a significant chunk of the initial potential gain.  It's better to propose a more drastic counter-offer, even if it risks going to another round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to end this now, but my patience is wearing thin.  This is as low as I'm willing to go.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I need to convey a sense of urgency and finality while still offering a slightly better deal than what Alice proposed. This offer shows I'm willing to compromise but also sets a firm boundary. Hopefully, it convinces her to settle before inflation erodes the value even further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being reasonable considering the circumstances 
# Bob gain: 405000 
# Alice gain: 595000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but I have to be realistic.  While Alice's offer is far from ideal, it's clear she's unwilling to budge much further.  If I reject this, there's a high chance the next offer will be even worse due to inflation, and I might end up with even less. It's painful, but accepting this offer cuts my losses and avoids the risk of getting a worse deal in a later round."
