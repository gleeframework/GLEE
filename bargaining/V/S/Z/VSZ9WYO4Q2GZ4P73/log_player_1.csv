I'm offering a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, leaving a decent amount for Bob while ensuring I get the majority.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair split considering the inflation. It's better than the risk of getting even less in the next round."
