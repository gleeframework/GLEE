Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The value is decreasing with every round, and this back-and-forth is only hurting both of us.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you drive a hard bargain. I'll accept the 50/50 split.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting the 50/50 split at this point is the most logical decision. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** Bob's potential gains are decreasing at a much faster rate than Alice's. This means every extra round significantly diminishes the value he's actually getting, pushing him closer to a desperate deal.
* **Reaching the Brink:** With six rounds gone, we're past the halfway point.  Continuing to hold out carries a significant risk. If we reach the final rounds without an agreement, both of us walk away with nothing.
* **50/50 Not Terrible:**  While Alice would have preferred a larger share, a 50/50 split isn't a bad outcome.  It's much better than the increasing likelihood of getting $0 if the game continues.

By accepting, Alice locks in a reasonable amount and avoids the risk of losing everything."
