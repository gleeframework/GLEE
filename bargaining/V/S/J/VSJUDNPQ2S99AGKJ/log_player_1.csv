Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. I'm offering you $4,500, which is still a good deal considering the inflation. Let's split it fairly and get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Each round sees a significant devaluation of the money. It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Bob's Expectations:** Bob's previous offer suggests he's aiming for a larger share than my initial proposal. However, his offer didn't account for the rapid inflation affecting my potential gains. 
* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm reducing my initial demand slightly to make the offer more enticing, but still aiming for a larger share due to the faster inflation hitting my side."
