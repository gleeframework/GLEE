"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more fair split is 60/40, as we both get a good amount and it avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
