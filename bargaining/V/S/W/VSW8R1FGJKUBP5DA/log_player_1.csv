Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small amount to see if he's willing to take it.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to take the 50% now than risk getting nothing at all.  Plus, I'm not sure what Bob's strategy is with inflation."
