"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since I'm the first to offer, I want to try and get the most I can, knowing the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have liked to have more, accepting a 50/50 split is the best course of action. With the money depreciating, each round is risky, and a 50/50 split ensures I get something instead of risking getting nothing at all in later rounds."
