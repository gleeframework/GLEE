"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000$ - 100,000$ split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation to affect future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 600,000$ - 400,000$ split in my favor.  Since Bob rejected my initial offer and inflation is a factor, I need to adjust my proposal. I believe this split is a fair compromise and a better outcome for both of us than the previous round's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's offer isn't ideal, the inflation rate is becoming a significant factor. Accepting this offer guarantees me a gain, and it's likely that any further rounds will only see the value of my earnings decrease further."
