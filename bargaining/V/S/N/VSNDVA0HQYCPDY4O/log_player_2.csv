"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this offer is tempting, I'm going to reject it. I know I have 12 rounds to get a better deal, and the inflation will hurt Alice more than me. I'll see if I can get a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
Let's split it evenly. This is a fair starting point, and with the inflation, it's likely to be in our best interest to settle sooner rather than later."
