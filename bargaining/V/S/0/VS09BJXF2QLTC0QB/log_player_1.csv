```

This is a tough one! While ideally, I want more, Bob is right. This is getting ridiculous. 

Let's analyze why accepting is the best option now:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is severely impacting me (-67.23%) compared to Bob (-40.95%). Every round that passes erodes more of my potential gain. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing means risking even lower offers from Bob in later rounds as the value diminishes.
* **Certainty:** Accepting guarantees I get something now. Rejecting risks walking away with nothing if we can't agree in the remaining rounds. 

An even split at this point is better than the uncertainty and potential for a worse outcome by continuing."
