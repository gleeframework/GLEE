"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference to see how you like it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more balanced start, let's see if we can find a better compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 9,000 dollars, which is 10% less than the original 10,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to get a larger share, considering the money is worth less with each passing round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm increasing my share, but still leaving room for a compromise.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $7,000, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses more value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a more equal split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 7,300 dollars, which is 27.1% less than the original 10,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's a 50/50 split, which is more equal than my previous offers. With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I think it's better to settle for a fair share now rather than risking getting less in future rounds."
