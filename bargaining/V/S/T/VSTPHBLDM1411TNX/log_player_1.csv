"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount, and we can discuss further if you want to proceed.""
}
```

This offer gives me $900,000 and Bob $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness proposal, but let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting Bob's gain, his offer is now worth 80% of the original amount, so he's actually offering me $400,000 and himself $400,000.

Since this is a 50-50 split, I'll accept this offer to get a fair share of the remaining money.
