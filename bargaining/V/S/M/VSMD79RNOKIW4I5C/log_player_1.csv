I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if he's willing to accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being quite greedy! While the inflation will hurt us both, I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided offer. I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer to try and find a middle ground.  While Bob's inflation is hurting him more, I believe a 60/40 split is still fair, considering the decreasing value of money."
