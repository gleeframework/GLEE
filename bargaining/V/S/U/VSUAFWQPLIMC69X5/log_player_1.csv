Let's start fair! I propose an even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'll offer Bob a slightly smaller share, but still more than his previous offer. Let's see if he's willing to compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still lower than my initial proposal, and I'm losing more and more value with each round. I'll try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm raising my offer again to try and secure a deal. Since I'm losing value faster than Bob, I need to offer him a little less to make it worthwhile for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse for me. The inflation is making my share worth significantly less, and I'm not willing to accept a deal that gives me so little.  I'll continue to push for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}

I'm going to increase my offer again. While I'm losing value with inflation, I'm still willing to give Bob a fair share to reach a deal before the inflation hits me too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is hitting me hard. I'm not going to accept such a low share. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm increasing my offer once more. With inflation, this is likely my last chance to get a deal that's remotely fair for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting ridiculous.  The inflation is decimating my potential gains.  At this point, even a small amount of money is better than nothing."
