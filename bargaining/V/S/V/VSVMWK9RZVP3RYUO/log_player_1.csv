"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the actual amounts I would get are:

* My gain: $80 * 0.8 = $64
* Bob's gain: $20 * 0.8 = $16

Now, considering Bob's offer in the second round:

* My gain: $50
* Bob's gain: $50

I'd rather accept this offer, as it's a better deal for me than the previous one, and I'm getting more money than I would have in the first round.
