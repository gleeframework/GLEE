"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure Bob might take it, and if not, I can adjust the offer next time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'm getting a much smaller share, the inflation means that my 40 is only worth 32, so it's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all."
