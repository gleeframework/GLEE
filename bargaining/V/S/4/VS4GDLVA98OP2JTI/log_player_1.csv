"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, see how it goes.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, to test the waters and see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $4000 * 0.8 = $3200. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $6000 * 0.95 = $5700.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer.
