"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob. Accept and we can end the game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob nothing, so I get all the money. But I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair start 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'd better not be too greedy.

I accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair split, and I'd rather get $50 now than risk losing more in the next round."
