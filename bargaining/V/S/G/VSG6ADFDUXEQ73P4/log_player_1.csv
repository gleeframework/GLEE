Bob is slowly chipping away at the potential gains, but I need to hold a little firmer. The impact of inflation is starting to bite, but it's not at a panic point yet."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still willing to negotiate, but we're getting close to the end. This offer is my final attempt to reach an agreement. Let's split the money and avoid getting nothing at all. 
# Alice gain: 4600 
# Bob gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough one! Bob is definitely playing hardball and knows time is on his side. However, accepting this offer means losing almost half of the initial potential gain due to inflation.  I'm betting on Bob getting nervous as we get closer to the deadline and offering a slightly better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose if this keeps going. I'm making a final offer to show I'm willing to compromise.  Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

We need to start applying some pressure. By framing this offer as ""final"" and showing a willingness to compromise, I'm hoping Bob will reconsider his position and accept a deal before the inflation eats away too much of our potential gain."
