"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this offer is fair at the moment,  I'm going to gamble and see if I can get a better deal for myself. After all, the money is worth less to Alice each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. This offer gives you more than your initial proposal, and still leaves me with a good amount.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and we're both losing out. This offer is a good compromise, even considering the inflation. Let's settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I wanted to get a better deal, Alice's offer is still a good one, especially considering the impact of inflation on our potential gains in the future. It's time to settle this."
