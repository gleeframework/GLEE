"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. It's a fair share, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'm being offered less in real terms.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll aim for a bigger share this time. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. Considering the reduced value, Bob's offer seems reasonable. I'll accept it this time.
