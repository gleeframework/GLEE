Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer. Since Alice's initial offer was 60 for her, I'll offer her a slightly higher amount to make it more appealing. Here's my offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll aim for a higher share. However, Alice's offer is quite skewed towards her side. I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject her offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth 19% less again. I'll aim for a higher share, but I'll also consider Alice's previous offers. Here's my new offer:

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
