Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the smaller share""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I'll take $6,000 and Bob will take $4,000. I'm trying to make a reasonable offer to get the game started."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob trying to take the majority of the money, but I'll consider his offer.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to make a new proposal that might be more appealing to Bob.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my earnings!

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. I'm not getting a great deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting even less.

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than going back to the drawing board.
