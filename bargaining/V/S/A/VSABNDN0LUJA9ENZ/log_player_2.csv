Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While my initial offer was rejected, I'm taking into account the inflation. I'm gaining 5% less than my initial offer, and Alice's offer is only 500 more than her initial offer. Since Alice's offer is relatively close to her initial proposal, it's likely she'll continue to offer similar amounts, and further rounds may result in even lower gains for me due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable gain, considering the current inflation situation."
