"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with $20. This way, I'll get a bigger share, but I'm leaving Bob with a decent amount as well. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split the money 50/50. That's a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it for a moment...

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the remaining $100, leaving Bob with 40%. This way, I'm still getting a slightly larger share, but I'm leaving Bob with a decent amount as well. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round! Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, which is a bit more in his favor than my previous offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is worth even less now, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $100, leaving Bob with 45%. This way, I'm still getting a slightly larger share, but I'm leaving Bob with a decent amount as well. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly! Bob's offer is a 70/30 split, which is quite in his favor. I'm not sure if it's the best I can get, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 30% and hope it's the best I can get!"
