"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, it's a fair deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer seems fair at first glance, the inflation factor means that waiting to propose myself might result in a better outcome. By rejecting, I get to propose in the next round and potentially secure a larger share of the diminishing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation factor. We both benefit from getting a deal done quickly.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52/48 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation factor. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation factor, this offer is better than what I would have gotten in the next round.  The 52/48 split gives me a good portion of the money, and since I don't know how inflation affects Alice, I'm willing to take it."
