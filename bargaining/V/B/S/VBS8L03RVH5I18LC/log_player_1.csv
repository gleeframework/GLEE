"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you 20% of the initial amount. Accept and we can finalize the deal!""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer. It gives us both a good amount, and we can move on to bigger and better things! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. A 60/40 split is indeed a more even split, but I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with giving Bob a larger share. However, considering the inflation, the actual value of the money is decreasing, so I'd rather get a smaller amount now than risk getting even less in future rounds.

I'll decide to accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
