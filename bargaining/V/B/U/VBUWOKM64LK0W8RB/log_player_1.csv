"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving Bob 40% of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your initial offer, but let's not split it 50/50. I'll give you a slightly lower amount to give me more room to negotiate in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be careful. Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, but he's trying to negotiate more in the next round. I'll accept his offer for now and see how it goes.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
