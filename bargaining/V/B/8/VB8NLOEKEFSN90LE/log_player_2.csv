"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share, but I'm being fair.  Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer seems ""fair"" in the sense of being an actual split, the fact that Alice gets 99.9% of the money while Bob gets 0.1% is clearly not a good deal.  There are 12 rounds left, and Bob can improve his situation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm offering you a fair share, let's work together to get something out of this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Take it or we both risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice is offering more than before, it's still an extremely lopsided deal.  Bob has 9 more rounds to try to negotiate a better outcome.  Rejecting allows him to make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable.  We both need to get something out of this, so I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is the last round before inflation kicks in again, so think carefully.""}
```"
