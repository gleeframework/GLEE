"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 with a 70/30 split in favor of you, Bob. This could potentially lead to more favorable offers in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept a quick 3000$ but, since we don't know how inflation affects Alice, we need to consider the possibility of getting a better deal later.  Rejecting allows us to make the offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, and we can continue to negotiate in future rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a 60/40 split in your favor, Bob. This maintains a balance while accounting for the decrease in the value of money over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is better than the 30/70 split in the first round.  Although it's a smaller gain than the 60/40 split we offered, we don't know how inflation affects us in future rounds. Accepting this offer seems like a good compromise."
