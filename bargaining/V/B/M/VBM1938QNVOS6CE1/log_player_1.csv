Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a good deal and avoid the risk of losing it all to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While I could try to negotiate for more, accepting a 50/50 split now avoids the risk of getting a much worse offer from Bob in a later round and having to deal with increasingly significant inflation."
