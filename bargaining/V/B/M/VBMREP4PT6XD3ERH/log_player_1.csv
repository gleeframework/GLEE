"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and leaving $2,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting that we can work together to find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a good starting point, considering the inflation factor. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive than I'd like. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'd like to propose a slightly more favorable split for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split would be more suitable, considering the reduced value of the money.""
}
```

I'm suggesting a 55/45 split, which would give me $4,500 and Bob $5,500."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise on the split. What do you think about this offer?""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,200 and leaving $5,800 for Bob."
