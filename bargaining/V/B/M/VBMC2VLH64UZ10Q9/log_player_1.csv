"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very generous offer to Bob in the first round.  I want to secure the deal quickly and avoid inflation eating into my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  accepting this offer is the best strategy.  If I reject, Bob will make the same proposal in the next round, and I'll lose 5% of my share due to inflation."
