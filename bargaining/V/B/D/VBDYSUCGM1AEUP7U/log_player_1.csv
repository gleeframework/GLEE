"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts I'll receive are:

* Alice gain: 400000 * 0.9 = 360000
* Bob gain: 600000 * 0.9 = 540000

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather wait for a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the 20% reduction in value due to inflation (10% in the first round and 10% in the second round), the effective value of the money is now 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of its original value.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000
}

This offer gives me $810,000 and Bob $190,000."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less, the actual amounts I'll receive are:

* Alice gain: 200000 * 0.7279 = 145380
* Bob gain: 800000 * 0.7279 = 582320

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather wait for a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the total reduction in value due to inflation (10% in the first round, 10% in the second round, and 27.1% in the third round), the effective value of the money is now 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.7279 = 0.6203 of its original value.
