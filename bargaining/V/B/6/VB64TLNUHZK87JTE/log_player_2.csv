Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and the money is losing value fast. 56-44 is my new offer 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

At this point, the inflation has eroded Bob's gains significantly. While a better deal might still be possible, the risk of getting nothing at all is now too high. Accepting this offer secures at least some money for Bob."
