"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to try and get the most I can, but I don't want to risk Bob rejecting the offer and then having the money be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While I'm losing a lot of money, I'd rather take my chances in the next round. There's a possibility that I can get a better deal, and I'm not willing to give away almost all of the money at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm taking a risk here. While I'm losing money due to inflation, I'm trying to secure a larger share. I think Bob might accept this offer, as it's still a significant amount of money for him, and he knows I'm willing to be aggressive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting significantly less than I hoped for, accepting this offer is the best option at this point. Inflation has severely impacted the value of the money, and I'm worried that if I reject this offer, Bob might propose an even lower amount in the next round, leaving me with very little. It's a painful decision, but I need to secure something before the value of the money drops even further."
