Round 5

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is slightly lowering her demand, the inflation is working heavily in Bob's favor.  Each round makes her offer less and less appealing due to the rapidly decreasing value of her share. Holding out longer is still the better strategy for Bob."
