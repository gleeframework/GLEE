"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a 40-60 split, which is a bit more skewed towards him. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the inflation and the fact that I want to get a better share of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, hoping to get a better deal this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his 45-55 split. Considering the inflation, my gain is worth significantly less than it was initially, so I need to be careful. I'll think about it...

Hmm... I think I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than going into further rounds and risking even lower gains due to inflation.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
