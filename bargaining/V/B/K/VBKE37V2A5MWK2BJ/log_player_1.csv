Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. We both have a chance to benefit from the potential future inflation, and this way we can avoid any risk of losing money in the next rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
