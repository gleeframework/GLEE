"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess as we go along.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 4000 * 0.9 = 3600.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer should be lower than before to account for the decreased value of the money.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3500,
  ""bob_gain"": 6500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give away too much. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this offer, hoping to get a better deal for myself."
