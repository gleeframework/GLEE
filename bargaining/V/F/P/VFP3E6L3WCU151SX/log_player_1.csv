"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I get 80% and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 4:1, I'll offer 3:2, a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think 3:2 is a significant improvement from 4:1, and I'm not willing to accept a split that's still heavily skewed towards Bob. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, 3:2 is too far. Let's try 3:3""}

I'm proposing a 3:3 split, which is a more balanced split compared to my initial 4:1 offer. I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway, hoping he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meeting halfway isn't enough, I'll give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. The 4500 I would get is still not enough, considering the value of the money has decreased due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go all-in on a 50/50 split. Let's make a deal""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
