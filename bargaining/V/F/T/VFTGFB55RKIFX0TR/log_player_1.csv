"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a straightforward and fair way to divide the money. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who's really taking the risk here. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'm not thrilled about the 80/20 split, but I suppose Bob's right that he's taking on more risk by making the first offer. I'll consider it.
