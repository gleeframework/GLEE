Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 55/45 split still feels too uneven.  Let's aim for a 52/48 split in my favor.  This feels more fair, and we can both still come out ahead.

# Alice gain: 5200
