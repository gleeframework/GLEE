6000.0,4000.0,Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. This is a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,Your offer was a bit unbalanced. Let's try something more even. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but a 55/45 split still feels too uneven.  Let's aim for a 52/48 split in my favor.  This feels more fair, and we can both still come out ahead.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4900.0,5100.0,"Time is running out, and we both lose if we don't agree soon. I'm proposing a 51/49 split - a slight edge to me, but closer to even. Let's seal the deal and avoid losing more to inflation.",Bob,4,
