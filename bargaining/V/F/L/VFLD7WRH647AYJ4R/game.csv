60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. We can adjust later if you'd prefer.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think a 55/45 split is fairer.  It's closer to even, and we can still adjust in later rounds if needed.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's be reasonable.  A 50/50 split seems like the most fair way to divide the money.  We can't keep going back and forth - we're losing value with each round!,Alice,3,
