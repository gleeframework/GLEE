"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's call it a truce! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I like the idea of meeting in the middle.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
