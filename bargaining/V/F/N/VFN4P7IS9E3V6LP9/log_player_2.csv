# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round. Alice's offer isn't quite fair to me, and I think we can do better. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want to meet in the middle, but the value decreases faster for me. I'll take 55, you take 45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
###\n\nI still think Alice's offer isn't quite fair, considering the inflation rate affects her more than me. I'd like to make another counteroffer in the next round to try and find a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I can give a bit more. How about 52 for me and 48 for you?""}"
