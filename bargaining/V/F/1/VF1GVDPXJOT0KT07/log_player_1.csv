I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping to secure a good deal early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation is already taking a bite out of the potential gains.  Accepting a 50/50 split is a safe bet, especially considering the potential for further losses with more rounds."
