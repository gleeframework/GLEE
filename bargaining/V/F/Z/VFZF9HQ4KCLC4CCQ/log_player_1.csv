"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5,000
* Bob gain: $5,000

I think Bob's offer is a bit too aggressive, considering the initial amount was $10,000 and now it's worth $9,500. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more for taking the lead so far 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $4,350
* Bob gain: $5,475

I'm not sure I like the direction this is heading, but I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less, I'd like to try to get a better deal. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round.
