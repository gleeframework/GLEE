{""bob_gain"": 990000, ""alice_gain"": 10000, ""message"": ""Alice, you were very generous in the last round. However, I believe I can do better this time.  Let's split the money almost evenly, with a slight advantage for me, given the inflation factor.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be fair this time.  We both get a decent amount, and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our gains any further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
