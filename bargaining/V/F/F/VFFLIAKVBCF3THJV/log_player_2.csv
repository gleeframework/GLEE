"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is fair and benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, Alice, but my previous offer was too low. Let's meet in the middle.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is the same offer I gave you in round one.  Let's be reasonable, accept this offer and we both benefit.  The clock is ticking and the money is losing value! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is employing deceptive tactics. While she claims the offer is the same, inflation has significantly reduced the value of her share. I should continue to push for a more equitable split, knowing that time is on my side due to the differential inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4750, ""alice_gain"": 5250, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be reasonable, but we need to account for the changing circumstances. This offer is a fair compromise.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining a firm stance:** I'm increasing my share slightly to show Alice I'm serious about getting a better deal. 
* **Acknowledging the time pressure:**  I need to acknowledge that the value is decreasing for Alice, which might make her more open to a compromise.
* **Keeping the message neutral:**  I don't want to antagonize Alice with accusations of deception, but I'm making it clear that I understand the situation's dynamics."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a small hit here, but we need to close this deal before inflation eats away at the value even further. Take this offer and let's be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure, and her offer reflects that.  However, she's trying to frame a reduction in her share as a ""small hit"" when it's a significant decrease due to inflation.  My position is only strengthening with time, and I can afford to be patient. Accepting an offer below 50% wouldn't be strategic, especially when I'm not losing any value due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's end this negotiation. A 50/50 split is fair and avoids further losses from inflation.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting to an equal split:** It's time to offer what I ultimately want â€“ an equal share.  This is a strong position, as it's objectively fair.
* **Highlighting the mutual benefit:** I'm emphasizing that accepting this offer prevents further losses for both of us. While the inflation only impacts Alice directly, I lose potential gains the longer this negotiation drags on.
* **Projecting confidence and finality:**  The tone is firm but not aggressive. I'm signaling that this is my final offer, and Alice should seriously consider accepting it."
