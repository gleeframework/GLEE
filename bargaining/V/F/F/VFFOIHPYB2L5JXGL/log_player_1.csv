"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a generous 20% of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this offer is significantly better than my original offer, considering the reduced value of money. I'll wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""My offer is more generous than Bob's last one. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to stay firm and make a strong offer, considering the continued inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to meet you in the middle. It's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the continued inflation, my gain of $5500 is actually worth less than my previous offer of $6000. However, Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than his previous one.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a fair compromise given the circumstances."
