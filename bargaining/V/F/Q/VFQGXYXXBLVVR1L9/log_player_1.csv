"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better with a more even split. Let's work towards a fairer outcome. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less after inflation, I need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% gain for myself, especially with the money losing value with each round. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first two rounds, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the loss of value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a higher share to account for inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the money, which is a bit more than Bob's previous offer, but still a compromise."
