Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is still good for you, and time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

Round 4

""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer, it's more than fair considering the time pressure.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns. This is a reasonable offer, and the clock is ticking. Don't let greed get the best of you. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are becoming severe. While getting a slightly larger share would be ideal, accepting Alice's offer now is better than risking even greater losses to inflation in future rounds."
