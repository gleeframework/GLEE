"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer ensures you get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives Alice a significantly larger share, and with inflation affecting only my portion, I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round in hopes of a more equitable division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle, considering I'm the one losing value each round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, Alice's new offer doesn't significantly improve my position from the first round. I'll reject this offer, hoping that Alice will be more willing to compromise as the game continues, despite the decreasing value of the money for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 475000, ""alice_gain"": 525000, ""message"": ""I'm still willing to find a middle ground, but the effects of inflation make every round more costly for me. Let's settle on a more balanced share.""}"
