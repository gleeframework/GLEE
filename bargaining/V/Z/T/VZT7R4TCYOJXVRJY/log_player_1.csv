"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a balanced division""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, 50/50 is the best way to start 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50/50 split, as it's not as advantageous for me as my initial proposal. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal. I'll pass on this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly better deal, but I'm still trying to get a bit more for myself. I think this 55-45 split is a good middle ground, and I hope Bob will consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split this time.  I'm willing to compromise, but I think my contribution deserves a bit more recognition. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for, and the 55-45 split is a decent compromise. Considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiations and risk getting a worse deal."
