"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a split of $900,000 for me and $100,000 for Bob.  This gives me the majority of the money, but it's still a significant sum for him. I'm hoping he'll accept, as he's likely to get a worse deal if we go to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm getting less than I initially proposed, after inflation, this is a better deal for me than risking another round and potentially getting an even worse offer."
