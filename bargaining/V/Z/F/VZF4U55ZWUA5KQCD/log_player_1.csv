"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very unequal offer, but it's a gamble!  I'm hoping Bob will be tempted by even a small amount, especially considering the inflation.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 800000 
# Bob gain: 200000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is more fair, it's still better than getting nothing in the next round.  The inflation would mean I'd get even less than 800,000 then!"
