"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering to split the money 50/50, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a high note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
