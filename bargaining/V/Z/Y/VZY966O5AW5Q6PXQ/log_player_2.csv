"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not sure about that. I understand Alice's proposal, but I want to see what kind of offer I can get. I'll reject and see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is fairer considering the inflation rates.  Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share should be a bit higher. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, considering the inflation and the limited rounds, accepting Alice's offer seems like the best strategy. The potential loss from further rounds is significant."
