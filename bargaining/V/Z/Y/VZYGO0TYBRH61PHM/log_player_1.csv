"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob will get 40%, which is $4,000. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60-40, I'll try 80-20 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $6,000 is now worth $4,800 in terms of purchasing power.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about taking only $2,000, especially since the initial amount is now worth less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a stronger offer now that Bob has made a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation (20% in each of the two rounds), I'll aim for a higher percentage.
