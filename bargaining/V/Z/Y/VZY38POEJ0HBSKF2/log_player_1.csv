"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% of the initial amount, and you'll get 20%. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, I'll get $8,000 and Bob will get $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you half, but I think it's a good starting point. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'll gain are:

* Alice gain: $5,000 x 0.95 = $4,750
* Bob gain: $5,000 x 0.8 = $4,000

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
