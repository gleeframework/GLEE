"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the potential loss in value over time.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation is affecting you, but I think I can get a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob acknowledges the impact of inflation, his offer still heavily favors him.  The longer this goes on, the more I lose, but it's better to hold out for a fairer deal. Bob is likely to become more willing to compromise as we approach the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Bob, this is a compromise. I'm taking a significant hit due to inflation, but I'm willing to settle for a slightly smaller share to reach a deal.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is really hurting your share. I think it's time to settle. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, this is the same offer I made in Round 1, but now worth significantly less.  Rejecting it risks even further losses from inflation with no guarantee of a better outcome. It's time to cut my losses and accept."
