"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money in a 3:1 ratio. This way, I receive a larger portion, but still leave some for you.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40. This is a fair deal given the inflation we're facing, and ensures we both get a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
