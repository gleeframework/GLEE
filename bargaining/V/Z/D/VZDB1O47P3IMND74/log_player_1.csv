Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and take almost everything this round.  I'll see if Bob is okay with that, but I'm willing to negotiate in future rounds if necessary.  It's a big gamble, but if it works, I win big!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take half now than risk getting nothing in the future. Even with inflation, half a million is a huge amount of money!"
