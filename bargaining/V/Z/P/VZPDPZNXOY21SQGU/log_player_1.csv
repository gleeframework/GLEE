Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. I propose we split the money 60/40, with you getting the larger share. We still have plenty of time left to work out a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
