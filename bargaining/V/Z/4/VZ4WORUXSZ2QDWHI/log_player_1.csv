Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is happy with taking the smaller share. I'm feeling generous in this first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm not getting the majority of the money, it's better to accept now than risk getting less in the next round."
