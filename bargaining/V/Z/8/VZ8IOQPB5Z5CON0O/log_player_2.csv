"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate further if you'd like.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's try a 70/30 split.  This is a reasonable compromise considering the inflation affecting your share.  Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer this goes on, the more my share is impacted by inflation. I need to push for a more equitable split quickly."
