Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll gain $70, which is worth 70% of the original $100, or $70. However, due to the 20% inflation, it's actually worth $56. This is a decent offer, but I think I can do better.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.
