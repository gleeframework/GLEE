"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While the offer seems fair at first glance, Alice is taking a larger share upfront.  Given the inflation rate, it's in my best interest to negotiate for a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm aiming for a slightly more balanced split.  This seems fair considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer considers the inflation impact on my end. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, but it's still skewed in her favor considering the inflation heavily impacts her, not me. I'm willing to push for a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice. This offer is a compromise that accounts for the inflation affecting us both. Let's close this deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is pushing it.  We both need to agree quickly or we both lose out. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough call, but with the time pressure and Alice's statement that it's her final offer, I need to make a decision. Accepting nets me a reasonable sum, even if it's not ideal. Rejecting risks us both walking away with nothing.  It's a gamble I'm not willing to take at this point."
