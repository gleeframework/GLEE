"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is actually worth $36 (90% of $40) and Bob's gain of $60 is worth $57 (95% of $60).

I'm not too thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I suppose it's a slightly better deal than my initial proposal. However, I'm not convinced that I deserve to take the short end of the stick.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less now due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve a bit more after your last offer""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will take this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more, considering the value of money has decreased 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $45 is worth $32.65 (72.89% of $45, since 100% - 27.1% = 72.9%) and Bob's gain of $55 is worth $47.37 (85.26% of $55, since 100% - 14.26% = 85.74%).

I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but it's still a slightly better deal than my previous offer. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll accept this offer.
