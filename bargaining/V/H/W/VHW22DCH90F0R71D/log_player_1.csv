"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

This way, I'll get 55% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased for me, but Bob's offer is still quite generous. I'll accept this offer.
