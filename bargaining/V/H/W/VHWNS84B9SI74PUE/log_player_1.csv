I'm offering a 900,000 - 100,000 split.  Let's see if Bob is happy with that. ðŸ˜‰"

I'm offering 810,000 for me and 190,000 for Bob.  I'm still hoping for a good deal, but I'm also factoring in the continued inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While the inflation has eaten away a lot of the potential value, I'm still getting something out of this. It's better than getting nothing at all, and I'm tired of the back-and-forth!"
