"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
``` 
I propose to keep 990,000 for myself and give Bob 10,000. I'm hoping this will be enough to encourage him to accept in the first round, as the inflation will affect him as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While it's tempting, I still think I can do better. Even with the inflation, I'm hoping to get more than 200,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to offer a 550,000/450,000 split.  The inflation has hit me harder than Bob, but I'm hoping this is still a fair offer that he'll find tempting. I'm willing to give up a bit more to avoid further rounds and the risk of even more inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm disappointed to be getting less than I originally hoped for, the inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money, and Bob's offer is now the best I'm likely to get. It's time to accept."
