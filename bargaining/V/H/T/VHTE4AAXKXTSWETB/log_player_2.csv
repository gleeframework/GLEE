**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation and the pressure of time. While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, accepting now would still give Alice a significantly larger share. We're past the halfway point in the rounds, so it's time to start pushing for a more favorable outcome."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A perfectly even split is the only fair option.  Accept now, or we both get nothing.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only six rounds left, the time pressure is significant. We need a strong stance to avoid Alice running out the clock with increasingly unfavorable offers. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is undeniably fair.  
* **Ultimatum:** Framing this as a final offer creates urgency for Alice to accept a reasonable deal.  She risks getting nothing if she continues to push for an uneven split."
