This offer is extremely lopsided, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. The risk-reward ratio seems skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not convinced that it's worth taking such a big hit. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

This offer is getting ridiculous. The share I'm being offered is incredibly small, and I'm not willing to accept such a tiny fraction of the total amount. I think Bob is trying to squeeze me out, and I'm not going to let that happen. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
