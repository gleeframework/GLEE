"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30$ and keeping 70$ for myself. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'm now looking at a gain of 63$ (70% of 90 is 63).

I like Bob's message, and meeting halfway seems reasonable. I'm willing to accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
