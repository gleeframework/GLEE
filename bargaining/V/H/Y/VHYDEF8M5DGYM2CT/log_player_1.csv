"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my gain of 3000 is worth 4,500 (95% of 4,762.5, which is 5% less than 5000). That's a good chunk of money, but Bob's gain of 7000 is worth 5,600 (80% of 7,000). I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or try to negotiate further.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. With inflation, my gain will be worth even less, so I'll aim for a bigger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's calculate the value of the gains with inflation:

My gain of 4000 is worth 4,125 (85.63% of 4,762.5, which is 14.26% less than 5000).
Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 3,840 (64% of 6,000, which is 48.8% less than 7,000).

I'm not sure if this offer is any better than the previous one. I'll reject it.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,

I'm proposing a 90-10 split this time. It's a high-risk, high-reward move, but I'm trying to maximize my gain given the inflation."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 9990 
Do you accept this offer?","This is the final round, and Bob's offer is essentially a take-it-or-leave-it proposition.

My gain of 10 is worth 5.7 (0.114% of 5,000, which is 43.12% less than 5000).
Bob's gain of 9990 is worth 1,400 (20% of 7,000, which is 91.41% less than 7,000).
