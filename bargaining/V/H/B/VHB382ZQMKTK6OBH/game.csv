45.0,55.0,"Alice, I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing. We both lose value, but at different rates.  Let's end this now.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be reasonable.  You rejected my offer of 60/40, and now with inflation, even your proposed 55/45 split isn't as good for you as my original offer. I'll take 55, you take 45, and let's end this before the money is worth even less.",Alice,3,
