"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I propose we take $60 and you take $40. This seems fair to me since the money loses value more quickly for me.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we're facing. We both lose value, but at different rates.  Let's end this now.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  You rejected my offer of 60/40, and now with inflation, even your proposed 55/45 split isn't as good for you as my original offer. I'll take 55, you take 45, and let's end this before the money is worth even less. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
