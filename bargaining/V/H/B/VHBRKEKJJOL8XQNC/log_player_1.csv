"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very greedy proposal, hoping Bob will see reason and accept a slightly more fair division in the next round.  Let's see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, I'll accept it.  It's better than waiting for another round where I might get even less!"
