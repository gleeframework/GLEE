Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are really hurting Bob's potential gains. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for Bob. It's better to cut his losses and accept a less-than-ideal offer than to risk even further devaluation of his share."
