Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This feels like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a fair deal. Even with the inflation, I'm getting half of the money, which is better than risking a worse deal later on."
