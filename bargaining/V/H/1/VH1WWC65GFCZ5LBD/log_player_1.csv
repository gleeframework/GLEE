"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping to set the tone for a fair negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair starting point, and we can both benefit from this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I'm not getting a significant enough share of the money. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to increase my share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I need to get something more than just 3000. Let's try to reach a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than the initial amount, my share of $6,000 is still not as high as I'd like. However, it's a slightly better offer than before.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time, as it's a more reasonable compromise.
