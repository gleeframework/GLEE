"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to consider accepting the offer and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't beat this, can you? 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, the offer from Bob is now:

* Alice gain: $250,000
* Bob gain: $750,000

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but it's a decent compromise. I'll accept it.
