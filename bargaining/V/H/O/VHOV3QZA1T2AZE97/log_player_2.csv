"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer represents an initial division where I aim to share a significant portion with you, acknowledging the risk of inflation. Please consider it carefully. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation rate is much higher for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I believe this split is more fair considering the inflation rates.  It's a good starting point for negotiation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal division of the funds, aiming for fairness despite the inflationary pressures. This maintains a balanced approach for both parties involved. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I would prefer more, the inflation is hurting Alice much more than me, and an equal split is a fair compromise at this point."
