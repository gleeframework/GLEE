"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'll reject this offer. While it's a decent amount, I want to see if I can get more. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself, especially since the money is losing value with each round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a more even split.  I'm willing to give Alice 400,000, but I want 600,000 for myself. I believe this is a fair deal considering the potential for inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, I'm worried about the inflation. Accepting this offer will ensure I get something, and with each round, the value of the money I'm getting decreases. It's time to cut my losses and take what I can."
