Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

I'm going to counter with a 60/40 split in my favor. Since the money is worth less with each round, I want to ensure I get a larger share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still hoping for a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

Since the money is worth less with each round, I'm going to stick with a slightly better offer for myself, but I'm willing to be a bit more generous to try and secure a deal before the inflation hits even harder."
