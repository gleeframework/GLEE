"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and take the lion's share.  Let's see if Bob thinks it's worth it to take a smaller portion and risk being in the position of proposing next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair deal for both of us.  It's better than risking another round and losing even more money due to inflation."
