"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering I'm losing value each round""
}
```

I'm proposing to take 60% of the $10,000, which is $6,000, and offering Bob 40%, which is $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in this proposal, considering that I'm the one losing value each round due to inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit low for me. I'm willing to be generous, but let's make it worthwhile for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more""
}


I'm proposing to take $5,800 and offering Bob $4,200. I'm hoping this is more acceptable to Bob, as I've taken into account the inflation and tried to find a middle ground. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
