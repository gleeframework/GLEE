Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Time to settle. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though the money is worth significantly less to me now, I'm better off accepting this offer than risking another round.  Inflation will just keep hurting me."
