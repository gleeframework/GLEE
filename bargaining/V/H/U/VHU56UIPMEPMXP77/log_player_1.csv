I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll accept this offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation has made the situation worse, and it's better to get something than nothing."
