"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40.  I'm willing to negotiate, but this seems like a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to take the 4000, it's only round 1.  There's a good chance of getting a better deal, especially since the money is worth less in each subsequent round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split, with me getting 60%, is fairer. It's important to remember that the money is worth less each round, so taking a bit more now might be beneficial in the long run.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't accept less than 55% given the inflation. We can end this now and both get a decent amount.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a serious factor.  It's better to secure 4500 now than risk getting a smaller share later."
