"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split, with me getting 60%, is fairer. It's important to remember that the money is worth less each round, so taking a bit more now might be beneficial in the long run. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
