"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice\n{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. This is a generous offer, considering the inflation penalty I'll face if the game continues. Hopefully, Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think this split is more reflective of the situation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer because it gives Bob 60% of the money, which is too much in my opinion. I'd rather make another proposal in the next round and try to get a better deal, even though the inflation penalty will reduce the value of my gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise, considering the inflation""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 45% of the money and keep 55% for myself. This is a compromise, taking into account the inflation penalty I'm facing. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation is working against you, but this split seems fairer to me given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer because, considering the inflation penalty, getting 450,000 dollars now might be worth more than the potential gain from further rounds. I don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
