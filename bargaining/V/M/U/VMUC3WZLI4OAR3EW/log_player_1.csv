"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40. You can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message trying to convince him that this is a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair chance, but I think I deserve more. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is worth 20% less than my original proposal. Since his offer is now 5000, it's equivalent to 4000 in the first round, which is less than my original offer of 6000.

I'm not willing to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my initial offer of $6,000 is still a good deal for me. Since Bob rejected my offer, I'll try to make a slightly better offer for him. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go any higher!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I need a better deal. You're not getting away with all the money that easily! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the equivalent value of Bob's offer in the first round. Since the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less, his offer of $6,000 is equivalent to:

$6,000 / (1 - 0.488) = $11,764.70

This is more than my original offer of $6,000, and even more than my offer in round 3. I think I should accept this offer to get a better deal.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
