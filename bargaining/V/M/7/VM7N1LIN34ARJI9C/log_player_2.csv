"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. It's a fair deal considering the inflation working against you.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer undervalues the money's depreciation for you in later rounds. I'm proposing 5800/4200.  Let's settle this before the inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is correct that the inflation is working against me, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. It's better to hold out for a better deal for a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 4500,
