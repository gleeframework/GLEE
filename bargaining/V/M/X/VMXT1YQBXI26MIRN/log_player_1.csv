Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose the same 900,000/100,000 split as in the first round. While Bob's money is worth less, mine is not, so this offer is still favorable to me."
