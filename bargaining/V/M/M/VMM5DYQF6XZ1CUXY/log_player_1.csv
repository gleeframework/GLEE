"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, with a slight advantage for me considering the inflation we face. This ensures we both benefit.""
}
``` 

Here's why I chose this strategy:

* **Understanding the Game:** This is a variation of the classic Ultimatum Game with the added element of inflation working against Alice. This means Alice needs to be assertive in the early rounds to maximize her potential gain.
* **Fairness with an Edge:** A 52.5% / 47.5% split slightly favors Alice but is still reasonable enough that Bob might consider accepting it in the first round.  
* **Clear Communication:** The message aims to be transparent about the reasoning behind the offer, potentially making Bob more receptive.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your cut is diminishing each round Alice. I'm offering a larger share than last time, but we need to settle this quickly for both our benefits. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is better than the initial split he would have received, it's still heavily in his favor. More importantly, Bob is now employing psychological tactics, highlighting the shrinking pot from Alice's perspective.  

Here's why rejecting is the stronger move:

* **Demonstrating Resolve:**  By rejecting, Alice shows Bob she's not easily intimidated and is willing to play the game strategically.
* **Inflation Factor:** The inflation is significant but not yet crippling. Alice can afford another round to try and secure a more equitable split. 
* **Shifting Power:**  Each round that Bob doesn't secure an agreement gives Alice more leverage due to the inflation working in her favor."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. Time is a factor for both of us. I propose a 50/50 split to finalize this now and ensure we both walk away with a substantial sum.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Shift:** After two rounds, it's time for a more direct approach.  A 50/50 split is undeniably fair and removes any room for Bob to argue about advantage.
* **Time Pressure:** By emphasizing the ""time is money"" aspect for *both* players, Alice reinforces the disadvantage of dragging the game out any further.
* **Leaving Emotion Out:**  The message is firm but neutral, avoiding any sense of desperation or pleading that Bob could exploit. 

This offer puts the ball squarely in Bob's court. Will he be sensible and take the fair deal, or risk letting the diminishing returns affect his own gain?"
