I'm not going to accept a 60/40 split right away. There's a lot of money at stake and I'm going to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
``` 
Let's flip the script. I'll take 60% and leave 40% for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still trying to take more than half, even with the inflation. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000}
``` 

I'm going to offer a slightly more balanced split, hoping it will be more appealing to Alice.  I'll take 51% and leave 49% for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 481600 
# Alice gain: 518400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is still trying to get a better deal, but the inflation is starting to hurt. I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round, and it's getting increasingly risky.  I'll accept this and take what I can get."
