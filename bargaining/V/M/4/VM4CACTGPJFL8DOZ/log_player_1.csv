"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take the lion's share, but I'll give you a decent chunk too.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 800,000 dollars and Bob gets 200,000 dollars. This way, I'll have a significant lead, but Bob will still get a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, a fair and simple approach 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up 50% of the money, but it's a fair proposal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with a lower value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
