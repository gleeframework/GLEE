Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't take my first offer, now it's a bit less for you 
# Bob gain: 4200

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage.  While time is ticking, accepting an increasingly unfair deal just sets a bad precedent. I'm betting she'll become more reasonable as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Time is running out. This is a reasonable offer considering the inflation.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm shifting closer to Alice's desired split, but not capitulating entirely. 
* **Time Pressure:** Emphasizing the dwindling time adds weight to the offer and might nudge Alice towards a quicker agreement. 
* **Future Leverage:** By conceding slightly, I might secure a better bargaining position in later rounds if this offer is rejected."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is eating away, don't be stubborn 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting more aggressive, but her offer is still unacceptable.  The rate of inflation is increasing, which means the losses become more significant with each round. However, accepting a deal this low sets a terrible precedent for the remaining rounds. It's a risky gamble, but I'm hoping Alice will panic as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. We're approaching a critical point. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm mirroring Alice's offer from Round 1, signaling a willingness to compromise but establishing a firm boundary.
* **Ultimatum:**  By framing it as my ""final offer,"" I'm injecting urgency and shifting the pressure back onto Alice. 
* **Calculated Risk:**  There's a risk she'll call my bluff, but the dwindling rounds and rapidly escalating inflation make it a risk worth taking. If she rejects this, I'll likely need to concede further in the next round to avoid losing everything."
