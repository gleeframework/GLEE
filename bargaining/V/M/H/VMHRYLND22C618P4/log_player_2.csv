Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm proposing I take $700,000 and you take $300,000. It's a generous offer considering the time pressure and inflation working against us.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical.  My last offer was already generous, and the clock is ticking. I'm adjusting slightly to $650,000 for me and $350,000 for you.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is barely budging! This offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. We need to show strength and push for a more even split."
