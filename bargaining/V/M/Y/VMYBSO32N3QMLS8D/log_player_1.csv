"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 
 
I propose to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000.  I think this is a fair starting point, giving me a slight advantage as the first proposer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer more, accepting this offer is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting less in future rounds."
