"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40 and take 60. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation will hit me harder than you. Let's move forward! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it from a value perspective.

However, I think 45 is a bit too low for me. I'll try to negotiate a bit more. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider a 50/50 split, but 45 is a bit too low for me. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 5% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation hits you harder, I'm willing to give you a bit more. 55 for me, 45 for you. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, I'm taking a slightly higher share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
