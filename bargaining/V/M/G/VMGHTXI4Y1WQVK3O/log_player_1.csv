Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think it's time for a compromise.  Let's split the money evenly and call it a day. It's getting risky to keep going. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
At this point, accepting a 50/50 split is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** Bob's perception of the money's value is decreasing significantly each round. While $500,000 is still a significant amount for him now, it will only get worse for him as time goes on. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to push for a larger share for yourself increases the risk of getting nothing if you fail to reach an agreement within 12 rounds. Accepting the 50/50 split guarantees you a substantial sum.

While you could try to push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the potential gains are outweighed by the increasing risk of losing everything as the rounds progress.
