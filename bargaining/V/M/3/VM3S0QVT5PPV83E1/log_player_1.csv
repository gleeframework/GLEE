"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start earning interest on our shares!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I'm looking for a better deal. My current offer was already quite generous, and Bob's counteroffer is even more favorable to him. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer now that I've seen Bob's counteroffer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This is a bit more favorable to me, but I'm still willing to compromise to get the game over with quickly."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less, my initial offer is looking even more generous. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the current state of the economy. I'll accept this offer.
