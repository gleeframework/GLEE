"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that I'll be losing value faster in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the 5% inflation rate for me, I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to potentially get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think this is a fair split. You're losing value faster, but I'm still willing to compromise.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the fact that Alice is losing value faster, but I've also considered my own inflation rate and the fact that I'm willing to take a bit of a risk to get a better deal. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Alice.\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Alice decides!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the longer this goes on, the less favorable it becomes for both of us. This offer still leans in your favor considering the inflation, but is more balanced than the previous rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's offer seems more balanced, I still think I can get a better deal. With the inflation rates, I'm willing to take another risk to potentially get more. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make another offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I understand the pressure of inflation, but I believe this offer is still reasonable. I'm trying to find a balance between our interests, considering the decreasing value for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nI've thought about Alice's previous message and the impact of inflation on both of us. I've decided to make an offer that still favors me slightly but takes into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Alice.\n\n###\n\nLet me know what Alice decides!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day.  Any further delays will only hurt both of us. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both of us, I think splitting the money evenly is a fair deal at this point. Further delays would indeed hurt both of us, and I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid additional losses.\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game with this agreement."
