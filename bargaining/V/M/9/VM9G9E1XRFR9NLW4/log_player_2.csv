**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I'm still losing a significant amount of money to inflation with each round. I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means going down to the wire."

# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** This is a tough one.  The inflation is really hurting, but Alice seems insistent on getting more than half.  I'm going to gamble that she's getting nervous as we approach the later rounds and might be willing to compromise further."
