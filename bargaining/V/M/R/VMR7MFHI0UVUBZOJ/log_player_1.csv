"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll compare the values directly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer because I can get more money in the next round, considering the inflation."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 0.9 times the value in the first round, and 0.81 times the value in the second round. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 630000,
  ""bob_gain"": 370000
}
```

This way, I get a higher share than in the first round, taking into account the inflation."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll compare the values directly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer because it's a 50-50 split, and it's a fair compromise considering the inflation."
