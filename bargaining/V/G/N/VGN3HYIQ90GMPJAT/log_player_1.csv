Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in our favor. This is a fairer distribution than your initial offer, and it will ensure we both get a decent share of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{
