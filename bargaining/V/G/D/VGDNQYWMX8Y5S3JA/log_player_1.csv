"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than that. This offer is fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my share is actually less than before. Let's settle this!""}\n\n### I hope this offer is acceptable to Bob. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This back and forth is pointless. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. The longer we wait, the less we both get. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think it's time to end this game. With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and Bob's offer is reasonable. Splitting the money evenly seems like a fair deal at this point. Let's accept the offer and move on!"
