"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which means I'll take $6,000 and Bob will take $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more even split this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $3,000 is worth 90% of the original $6,000 I proposed in the first round, and Bob's gain of $7,000 is worth 80% of the original $8,000 he would have gotten in the first round.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems like Bob is trying to take a larger share of the money. I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle this time!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which means I'll take $4,500 and Bob will take $5,500."
