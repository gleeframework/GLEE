"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. This is a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to take a bigger share, but still leaving you with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, my gain of $2,000 is now worth $1,900.

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since my gain is now worth $1,900, I'd rather have a higher amount than $1,900. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so my offer will be:

  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I still want a decent amount for myself. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,500 and leaving $5,500 for Bob. This is a 45-55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more for my efforts. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is catching up!

My gain of $1,000 is now worth $860, considering the 14.26% inflation.

I'm not happy with this offer, especially since Bob's gain is still worth the same as in the first round. I'll reject this offer.
