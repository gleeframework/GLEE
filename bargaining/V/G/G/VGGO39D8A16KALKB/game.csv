300000.0,700000.0,"Your offer was quite imbalanced, Alice. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Think carefully - the clock is ticking and the value of the money is decreasing with each round.",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I'm willing to give you a better deal this time. 60/40 split in my favor, but I think it's a more balanced approach.  Let's not let the money lose too much value. What do you say?",Alice,3,

350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time.  My offer is 65% for me and 35% for you. This is a reasonable split considering the decreasing value. Let's close the deal before inflation eats away at our potential gains.",Bob,4,
