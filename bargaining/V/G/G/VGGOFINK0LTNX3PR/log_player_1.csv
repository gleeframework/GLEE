"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves something for Bob.  I hope it's enough to incentivize him to accept the offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a fair split, but I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm willing to take the risk and see if I can negotiate a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still giving Bob a decent share. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept, as I believe the risk of further inflation could make him less willing to reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still feeling optimistic about getting a better deal. Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial proposal, but I believe I can still push for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm making one last attempt to secure a deal before the inflation gets too out of hand.  This offer is still more favorable to me, but I'm recognizing that Bob's share is increasing due to the inflation.  I hope this will be enough to entice him to accept and avoid further risk of losing more money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one.  Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, which I initially rejected. However, the inflation is making his offer more attractive to me.  I'm concerned about the potential for further inflation and losing even more money, so I'm going to accept this offer."
