"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money 60/40 in my favor.  After all, I'm the one making the offer this time!  Let's see if you're up for it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made. 
# Bob gain: 5800 
# Alice gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

It's not ideal, but I'm not sure I'll get a better deal if I reject again. Let's take it!"
