"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000$ and keeping 6000$ for myself, which is a 60-40 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money 60/40 in my favor.  After all, I'm the one making the offer this time!  Let's see if you're up for it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ha! Bob thinks he's the smart one, huh?

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my 4000$ would be worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is 4800$. So, in real terms, I'd be getting 4800$.

I'm not sure if I want to give Bob a 60-40 split, especially when I could potentially get a better deal in later rounds.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my offer would need to be adjusted accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 5800$ and keeping 4200$ for myself, which is a 58-42 split. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this compromise!"
