Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

This is a tricky one, but the inflation is working heavily against Alice. While ideally, I'd want a bit more, accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a reasonable amount of money.  Waiting longer might force me to accept even less favorable terms in a future round."
