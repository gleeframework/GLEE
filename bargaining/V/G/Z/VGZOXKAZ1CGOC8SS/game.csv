5500.0,4500.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's split it 55/45 in my favor.  This takes into account inflation, but also tries to find a balance between our interests.  What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split it evenly this time.  Inflation is hitting us both hard, and a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option.",Bob,4,
