"Round 1

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going for a very greedy opening offer, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round.  After all, 100,000 is still a pretty good chunk of change!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to pull a fast one! I'm not going to let him get away with that.  He's offering me a mere 100,000, while he takes 900,000?  Absolutely not.  I'll see what I can get in the next round.  The inflation will hurt him more than it hurts me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a large majority of the money.  It's a risk, but I believe I can still get a good deal. Bob is likely feeling the pressure of the inflation and might be willing to accept something less than what he originally wanted."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is playing a game of chicken here.  He's mirroring my offer from the previous round. I won't fall for it!  I'm still in a better position to weather the inflation since I have more rounds to go. I'll counter with a slightly more generous offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm taking another significant step down in my offer.  However, I'm still taking the lion's share. Bob has been stubbornly holding out, but I'm hoping he'll realize that the inflation is impacting him more, and he needs to compromise.  He's already lost out on a lot of potential gains by rejecting my offers.  This is my last chance to make a big move before the inflation bites into my share significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is playing a game of tit-for-tat. I'm not falling for his mirroring tactics again.  He's clearly trying to wear me down, but I'm determined to get a better deal. I will counter with a slightly more generous offer in the next round, even though inflation is starting to hurt.  We're reaching a critical point in the game, and I need to make a strong move."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm still taking a significant share, but I'm increasing Bob's portion.  We're getting close to the end of the game, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. I need to find a compromise that will keep me from losing too much, while also giving Bob enough incentive to accept.  I'm hoping that he'll see the value in taking a slightly smaller share now than risking getting nothing at all in the final rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting bolder with each round, mirroring my offer again.  I refuse to cave in.  While the inflation is certainly a concern, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm going to counter with a more balanced offer in the next round.  We're nearing the end, and I need to secure a decent share to avoid losing a substantial amount due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is it. We're down to the wire and the inflation is really starting to bite. I'm offering a 50/50 split, a fair and even distribution. This is the most I can offer without risking ending up with nothing. Bob has been stubborn and unwilling to compromise, but I believe he'll realize that this is the best he can get. With only a few rounds left, it's time to settle and avoid getting nothing at all."
