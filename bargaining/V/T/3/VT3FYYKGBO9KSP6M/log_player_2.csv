**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is getting more desperate. She keeps lowering her demand, indicating that I have the upper hand in the negotiation.  While her offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, I believe I can push for a slightly better outcome in the next few rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this before inflation hurts us both further.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

By round 6, the inflation is starting to become significant.  A 50/50 split, while not ideal in earlier rounds, is now a strong strategic move. 

* **Shows Strength:** Offering an even split demonstrates that I'm willing to be fair, but I'm also not going to be exploited.
* **Time Pressure:**  The clock is ticking louder for Alice, who is losing money at a faster rate. This increases the pressure on her to accept a reasonable deal.
* **Risk Mitigation:** Holding out for more might backfire if Alice calls my bluff and I'm forced to accept a worse deal later or get nothing at all."
