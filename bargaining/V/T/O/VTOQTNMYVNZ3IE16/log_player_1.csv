"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 400k, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the potential for both of us to get nothing if we keep going. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not sure I like the fact that Bob is getting a larger share, but I also don't want to risk getting nothing. Considering the potential consequences, I'll accept this offer.
