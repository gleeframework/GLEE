Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a little more than half, but since my money isn't losing value, it's a fair trade for rejecting your offer.  Let's see if you're willing to work with me. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
