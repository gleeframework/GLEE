# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, Bob, but my turn for a counter-offer.  This is fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nStill not good enough for me, let's see what the next round brings."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real. This back and forth is pointless. I'm offering a fair 50/50 split before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nA 50/50 split seems fair at this point, and the inflation is really taking its toll. Better to secure this amount than risk further devaluation."
