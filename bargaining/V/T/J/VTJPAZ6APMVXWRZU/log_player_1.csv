Let's see if Bob is happy with a generous 90/10 split.  ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm not going to accept a 10/90 split. This is a two-player game, and I'm not giving away 90% of the money.  I'll make a better offer next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split this round. This is a fair offer, and I hope Bob sees it that way."
