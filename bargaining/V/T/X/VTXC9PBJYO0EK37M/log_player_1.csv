"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. This is a pretty generous offer, considering the initial amount is $1,000,000. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject this offer for now and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 630000,
  ""bob_gain"": 370000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $370,000 and keeping $630,000 for myself. This is a slightly more aggressive offer than before, considering the reduced value of the money. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the reduced value, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than before. I'll accept this offer.
