"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still holding out for more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, the effective value of my gain is $4000 / 0.8 = $5000. I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal, but I want more too""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less for me now (20% less than the previous round), the effective value of the money is $10,000 / (0.8 * 0.8) = $12,500. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I'm getting a better deal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 48.8% less for me now, so the effective value of the money is $10,000 / (1 / 0.848) = $11,760. Since the offer is for $3000, that's equivalent to $3000 / 0.848 = $3535.47 in the original value.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not enough, I want a better deal""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 68.32% less for me now (48.8% less than the previous round), the effective value of the money is $10,000 / (1 / 0.6832) = $14,625. The original $10,000 is worth $14,625 to me.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.
