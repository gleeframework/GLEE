"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000:100,000 split in my favor. This gives Bob a small share to start, but I expect him to accept knowing that if he rejects, he'll have to make the next offer and risk getting even less with inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split. While my share is significantly less than what I proposed in the first round, it's still a significant amount of money. Considering the inflation, I'm likely to get even less if I reject and have to make the offer."
