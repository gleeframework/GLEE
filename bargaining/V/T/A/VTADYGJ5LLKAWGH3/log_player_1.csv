Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very high offer for myself, hoping Bob will be tempted to take it, especially since we don't know how the inflation will impact him. It's a gamble, but a calculated one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer and it's unlikely that I'll be able to get a better deal. Even though I'm not sure about the inflation on Bob's side, I'm willing to take the 500,000."
