Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be real. The inflation is hurting us both.  A 50/50 split is the fairest I'm willing to go. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the negotiation goes, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us, but especially for me as Alice. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob is unlikely to offer me a significantly better deal than this as time goes on. He knows the pressure is on me due to the higher inflation rate.
* **Risk of Losing Everything:**  If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. It's better to secure something now than risk losing it all."
