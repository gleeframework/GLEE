Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try and be fair, but I also want to maximize my gains. I propose a 900,000 - 100,000 split in my favor. This seems like a good starting point given the inflation rates. Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even with the inflation, this is a better deal for me than what I offered in the first round. It's still a significant amount of money, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all by rejecting and going another round."
