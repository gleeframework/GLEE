"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a high-stakes game with significant potential loss due to inflation. While 100,000$ is a good starting point, Bob should aim for a more equitable split to maximize his gains over the course of the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
Let's start with a fair and equal split.  This is a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
