"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fairly aggressive offer, but I figure it's a good starting point, and I want to get as much as possible early on before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer offer than my initial proposal, and with the inflation effect, I'm likely to get less in future rounds. Accepting this split is the best way to guarantee I get a decent share."
