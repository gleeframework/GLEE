"Round 1

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more than last time, but I still deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Inflation is eating our money! Let's be fair and split it evenly before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better, the impact of inflation is rapidly eroding Bob's potential gains. Accepting $43 now is a significant loss compared to even a 50/50 split in earlier rounds.  Bob needs to push for a more equitable split while time remains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 53, ""alice_gain"": 47, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time!  This offer is more than fair to you, considering I'm losing almost 60% to inflation.  Let's be smart and take it before we both get nothing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're really feeling the pinch of inflation now, aren't you? I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm not budging much 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The relentless march of inflation has put Bob in a terrible bargaining position.  While Alice's offer is far from ideal, it's the best he's likely to get at this point. 

* **Time is running out:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is very high. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if Bob manages to squeeze a couple more dollars out of Alice in subsequent rounds, the impact of inflation will severely diminish their value. 

It's a bitter pill to swallow, but accepting now is the most rational choice given the circumstances."
