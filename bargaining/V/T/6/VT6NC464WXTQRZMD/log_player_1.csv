"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and simple offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to consider the value of the money I'll get in this round. If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, but its value will be 95% of what I would have gotten in the first round.

In the first round, a 50/50 split would have given me $50, which is worth $50 in value. Now, with this offer, I'll get $40, which is worth 0.95 * $50 = $47.50 in value.

Considering the value of the money, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, I also don't want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more than 40.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 55, which is a bit more than my initial 50, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think 45 is still too low for me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'll think about this offer.

Let's calculate the value of the money I'll get in this round. In the first round, a 50/50 split would have given me $50, which is worth $50 in value. Now, with this offer, I'll get $45, but its value is 85.74% (1 - 0.1426) of what I would have gotten in the first round, which is 0.8574 * $50 = $42.87.

Considering the value of the money, this offer is actually worse than the previous one, since I'm getting less value for my share. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more than 45.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 60, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I think 40 is still too low for me. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's calculate the value of the money I'll get in this round. In the first round, a 50/50 split would have given me $50, which is worth $50 in value. Now, with this offer, I'll get $42, but its value is 77.38% (1 - 0.2262) of what I would have gotten in the first round, which is 0.7738 * $50 = $38.69.

Considering the value of the money, this offer is actually worse than the previous one, since I'm getting less value for my share. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'm also not sure if I want to risk going to the next round.

However, I think I'll take a chance and reject this offer. Maybe Bob will make a better offer in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a very small share, but I think I deserve more than 42.""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 65, which is a significant increase from my previous offers. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared for another rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think 35 is still too low for me. I'm starting to think we're getting nowhere. 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's calculate the value of the money I'll get in this round. In the first round, a 50/50 split would have given me $50, which is worth $50 in value. Now, with this offer, I'll get $38, but its value is 69.83% (1 - 0.3017) of what I would have gotten in the first round, which is 0.6983 * $50 = $34.915.

Considering the value of the money, this offer is actually worse than the previous one, since I'm getting less value for my share. I'm starting to think that Bob is just trying to wait for the value of the money to decrease further.

However, I'm not sure if I want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less. I'll think about it for a moment...

Wait a minute... I think I'll accept this offer. I'm not getting a great deal, but I'm getting something, and I don't want to risk waiting for the next round.
