Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it's getting too risky for you, so I'm taking a bit more. This is my best offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough situation. While I'd like to get a larger share, waiting any longer is incredibly risky due to the inflation. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I at least get something, even if it's not ideal."
