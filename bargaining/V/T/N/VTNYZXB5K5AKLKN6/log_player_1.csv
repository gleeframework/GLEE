"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```
I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob is trying to take a larger share, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```"
