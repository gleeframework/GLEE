"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a 40/60 split right off the bat. There's a lot of money at stake, and I want to see what else Alice is willing to offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 55/45, but let's get this done before the money shrinks too much.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting us both, let's settle 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, inflation is a real factor here. I'm losing value faster than Alice, and accepting this offer ensures I get something substantial."
