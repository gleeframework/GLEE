Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  This is more in line with a fair split considering the inflation we're dealing with. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation is a factor, but your last offer was too low. This is a compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  A 50/50 split seems like the only fair option at this point, considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split is better than risking another round.  Bob's perception of value is diminishing faster than yours, and there's no guarantee he'll offer anything better in future rounds. He might even offer less!  It's better to secure something now than risk getting even less later."
