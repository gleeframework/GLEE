"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to take $90, and leave Bob with $10.  This seems like a good starting point, as it offers me a large portion of the money, while still giving Bob a small share.  I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While it might seem tempting at first glance, the inflation means that the $10 I would get is only worth $9 now.  I'm willing to take a chance on getting a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try a slightly more balanced approach this time.  Since Bob rejected my last offer, I'll increase his share to $20.  While I still want a good portion of the money, I'm trying to find a compromise that might be more appealing to Bob.  The inflation is making it harder to secure a good deal, so I need to strike a balance between being assertive and being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  The inflation is starting to hit hard, and while $20 is better than nothing, it's not a good deal considering the value of the money is declining so rapidly.  I'm hoping I can still negotiate a better deal for myself.  I'm willing to take the risk and see if we can reach an agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to try a more generous offer this time. The inflation is making things difficult, but I need to find a way to get Bob to agree. By offering him a larger share of the money, I hope he'll see the value in accepting. I'm still aiming for a good portion of the money for myself, but I realize that compromise is key at this point."
