"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, the actual amount I'd get is $400,000 x 0.95 = $380,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd get $380,000 and Bob would get $600,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer or not. It's not as good as my initial offer, but it's still a decent amount. However, I'm not convinced that Bob can't do better.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, giving Bob a bit more money, but still keeping a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up enough, I'll take a bigger share this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is catching up!

Considering the reduced value of the money, the actual amount I'd get is $300,000 x 0.857 (1 - 0.1426) = $257,610.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm running out of time and options. I'm not sure if I can do better, and Bob seems to be getting more aggressive. I'll accept this offer to avoid losing more value.
