Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with an even split.  We both lose value with each passing round, and this is the best way to maximize what we both receive. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While an even split seems fair on the surface, the inflation factor heavily disadvantages me. Bob is using this to his advantage, hoping I'll panic as the rounds decrease. 

I need to hold firm and continue pushing for a slightly higher share, knowing that each round makes my position stronger in his eyes (as his potential gains diminish)."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We are both losing money with each round. I am sticking with an even split.  It's the best way to maximize our gains at this point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing increases significantly. Bob is clearly banking on this.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While I'd prefer a larger share, the difference between my previous offer and a 50/50 split is no longer significant enough to justify the risk of continuing.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob seems fixated on an even split.  It's unlikely he'll agree to anything else, and further negotiation might push us past the point of any agreement. 

It's frustrating to concede, but sometimes the best negotiation tactic is to secure a reasonable deal while it's still on the table."
