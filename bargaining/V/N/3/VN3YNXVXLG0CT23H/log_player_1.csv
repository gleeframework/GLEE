"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I am the first to make an offer. This seems like a fair starting point, but I am willing to negotiate if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this offer is better than the previous one, it still feels unfair to me. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm proposing a 85/15 split in my favor, which is a slight increase from Bob's last offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe this is a fairer deal considering the inflation affecting our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really hitting hard now, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. While this isn't the ideal split, accepting this offer at least guarantees me something. I'll take the 70 and try to make the most of it."
