"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. Take a small piece now, or risk getting nothing at all later. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, the risk of getting nothing at all later is too high. It's better to keep playing and potentially get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
