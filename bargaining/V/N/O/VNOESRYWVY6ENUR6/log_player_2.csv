I'm Bob, and 10% is not a fair starting point.  Let's see what Alice will offer next."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable with you taking more than 40%. Let's see if we can find a solution. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still not happy with a 40/60 split. It's not fair, and I believe we can find a better compromise. Let's see what she proposes next."
