"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount. This leaves me with $700,000, which is 70% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $400,000 in this round is worth only 80% of the original $700,000 I was aiming for, which is $560,000. That's not bad, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.
