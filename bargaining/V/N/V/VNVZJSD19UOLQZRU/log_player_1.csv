I propose a 50/50 split.  It seems fair and gives us both a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 

I'm raising my share slightly to 55.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I believe a slightly more favorable split for me is fair, given that my share remains unaffected by inflation."
