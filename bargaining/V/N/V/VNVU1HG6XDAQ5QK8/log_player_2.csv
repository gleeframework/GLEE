"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share this round, but we can negotiate more evenly in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While starting off on a fair foot is nice, Alice is banking on Bob valuing future gains too highly. Bob needs to signal he's willing to play tough to get a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""That offer was too unbalanced. I'm proposing a more even split. Let's be reasonable and get this money."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:**  Alice's first offer was heavily skewed in her favor. Bob needs to counter with a strong offer that leans in his favor to signal he's serious about getting a fair share.
* **Time Pressure:**  While 11 rounds remain, the longer this goes on, the less the money is worth to Alice. Bob needs to capitalize on this time pressure. 
* **Direct & Firm:** The message is direct and avoids overly aggressive language.  Bob wants to encourage a deal but not at the cost of being walked all over."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  We both get a good amount, and we can avoid the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Fair Deal:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing for Alice, but it's better for Bob to secure a good deal now than risk getting a worse offer later or even timing out completely.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Accepting this offer guarantees Bob a significant sum. Holding out for more risks getting nothing at all if they can't reach an agreement in time."
