"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I think 60/40 is a good place to begin. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem favorable enough, considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. Let's proceed and see if we can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a more suitable split. Let's make a deal before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest option now, given the inflation. Let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, a 50/50 split seems reasonable at this point. Further rounds would only decrease the value of the money more drastically, so it's wise to accept this offer and secure the deal."
