"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob! Accept this and we can call it a day.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a little more, since you get to keep more of your money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'd like to try to get a bit more to compensate. But I don't want to be too greedy, or Bob might reject again.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is eating away at my potential gain, so I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a little too greedy, Bob! Meet me in the middle, and we can move on.""
