Round 3

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This offer still gives you a slight edge considering inflation, and moves us closer to an agreement.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, and time is running out, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on with time running out, Alice is using the inflation disparity to her advantage. Accepting this offer would mean I lose significantly more value due to inflation than she gains.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it's a slight improvement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice.  It reflects the inflation impact but also allows us both to walk away with something.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time is becoming critical, and while this offer isn't ideal, it's better to secure something than risk getting nothing. This offer is firm, and Alice will need to decide if she's willing to gamble on getting a slightly better deal in later rounds, knowing that I'm unlikely to budge further."
