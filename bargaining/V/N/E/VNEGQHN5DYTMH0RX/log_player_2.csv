"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since I'm starting the game. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 10% inflation rate per round is a significant factor, but I'm willing to take the risk for now. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to negotiate for a more favorable split, considering the inflation rate. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Let's rebalance the split to account for inflation. I'm willing to take a bit more risk.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll concede a bit, Bob, but let's not waste any more rounds.  Time is money, especially for you with inflation! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the inflation rate is taking its toll, I'm not convinced that 35 is the best I can get. Alice seems willing to negotiate, so I'll try to push for a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the increasing inflation rate, I'll try to find a middle ground that Alice might accept. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 52,
""alice_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation, so I need a slightly better split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm being flexible, but this really is my final offer.  Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept this offer. Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think 40 is a reasonable compromise. Further negotiations might not yield a better result, and I don't want to risk losing more value to inflation.
