I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, you can have a smaller share this time 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to weigh the 30 dollars I'll get against the potential benefits of waiting for a better offer.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still hoping for a fair split!""

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings! Considering the drastic reduction in value, I'll have to be very cautious with this offer.

With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about whether 20 dollars is a good deal. Since Bob is taking a larger share, I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of waiting against the risk of getting even less in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,

# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'm starting to get desperate.

Considering the drastic reduction in value, I'll have to think carefully about whether 10 dollars is a good deal. Since Bob is taking an enormous share, I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of waiting against the risk of getting even less in future rounds.

However, I'm starting to run out of time, and I don't want to end up with nothing. I'll decide to:

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
