Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  While I'm aware of the inflation, I'm hoping to secure a significant portion of the money early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 50/50 split now. The inflation is a serious factor, and if I reject, there's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round. It's safer to secure half the money than risk getting nothing at all."
