"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal given the current state of the economy. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my proposed gain of $700,000 is now worth less than Bob's offer of $400,000. I think I'll have to accept this offer.
