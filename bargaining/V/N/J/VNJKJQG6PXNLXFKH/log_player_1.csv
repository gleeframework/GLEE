Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but it wasn't quite fair. Let's try this - I take $55, you get $45.  Consider that the value decreases faster for you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
