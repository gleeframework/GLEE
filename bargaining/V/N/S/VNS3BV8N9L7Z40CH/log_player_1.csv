"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the generosity, but I think we can find a more equitable split. How about 60/40 in my favor? It's fair, considering the inflation you'll be facing. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
