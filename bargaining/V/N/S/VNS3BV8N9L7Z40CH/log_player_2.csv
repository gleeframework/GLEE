Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be fair. We'll split the money down the middle.  50/50.  This way, we both get a decent share, and we can avoid any more back and forth. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
