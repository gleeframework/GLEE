Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to find a middle ground, 52-48 is a good deal.

# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** We're getting close, but Alice is still getting a significantly larger share. There's a decent chance I can negotiate a better deal as time goes on and the pressure to avoid getting $0 increases."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, 50.5-49.5 is as low as I'll go. 
# Bob gain: 495000 
# Alice gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** This is very close to an even split, and with only 5 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing is too high. It's better to accept a slightly smaller share than to risk losing everything."
