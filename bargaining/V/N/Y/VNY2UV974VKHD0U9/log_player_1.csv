"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to be more cautious. Bob's offer is 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal, but I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation effect, my offer needs to be more aggressive. Here's my next proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm trying to get a slightly higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up! With the money worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be even more aggressive. However, Bob's offer is a 40-60 split, which is a relatively fair proposal considering the circumstances. I'll accept this offer to avoid further erosion of the money's value.
