I'm going for a high initial offer to try and secure a quick win, but I'm leaving a little room for negotiation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him than mine was for me, and even though my share is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'm still in a much better position to secure a larger share if we continue to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to try and push for a higher share again. Bob's offer was very generous, but I think I can still get a bigger piece of the pie. I'm taking a bigger risk with this offer, but I think it's worth it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has hit me hard, and while I still think I could get a larger share, Bob's offer is getting closer to what I could realistically secure.  Accepting means a lot less money, but it guarantees me a decent share and ends the game.  I'm not willing to risk losing even more due to inflation."
