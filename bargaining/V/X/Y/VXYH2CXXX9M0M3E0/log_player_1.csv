"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to share more than you offered, but I want a fair deal.  Let's split it 60/40.  If we can't agree, we can keep negotiating, but the money is worth less with each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
