Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was already factoring in the time value of money. This is my counter-offer, and I think it's more than fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
