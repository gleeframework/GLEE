Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it closer to 55/45, in my favor, since the money is devaluing faster for me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
