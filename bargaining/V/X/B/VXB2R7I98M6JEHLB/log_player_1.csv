"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This offer gives me a large share of the money (9000$) and leaves Bob with a smaller share (1000$).  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm aiming for a big advantage in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is significantly less than my initial proposal, it's important to remember that inflation has devalued the money. Taking 1000$ is better than getting nothing if the game continues and inflation erodes the value further."
