**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting steadily more desperate as the rounds go on and the money is worth less to her.  While her offers are getting better, I still believe I can get a better deal if I continue to hold out."

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

We are past the halfway point, and Alice is feeling the pressure.  While her offer is getting closer to a more even split, she is still proposing that she gets more than me.  I think I can push for a bit more before she gets truly desperate."

{
""bob_gain"": 7000,

""message"": ""This is my final offer, Alice. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to lay down the law.  Alice is running out of time and options. This offer is heavily in my favor, but it's still better than nothing for Alice. This puts the pressure on her to make a decision quickly."
