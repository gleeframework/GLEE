Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer of a 50/50 split, but let's be realistic. We both lose if this drags on.  This offer still gives you a good chunk, and we can both walk away winners. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
