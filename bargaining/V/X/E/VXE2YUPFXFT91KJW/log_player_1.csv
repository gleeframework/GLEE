"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and leaving $40 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share this round, but I'm willing to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $30 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $27.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too generous for him. I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too generous, I'll make a counteroffer!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain of $27 is now worth 90% of what it was in the second round, so it's equivalent to $24.40 (since $27 is 90% of $27, not 90% of $30).

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 45-55""
}
```"
