Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I want to find a solution, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is a fair offer considering the time constraint.

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher share, Bob has come up to a 60/40 split. Considering the time pressure and the fact that his share is rapidly losing value (making him more likely to accept a less favorable deal later), accepting now secures a reasonable outcome. It's better to take a decent deal than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
