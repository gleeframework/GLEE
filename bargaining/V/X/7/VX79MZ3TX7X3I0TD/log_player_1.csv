"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and simple proposal, hoping Bob will accept and we can divide the $100 evenly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good deal, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $40 in this round is worth 20% less than the $50 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to $40.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than $40. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a better deal, but I want a bit more too""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so my gain is worth 40% less than the $50 I would have gotten in the first round, making it equivalent to $20.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I need some for myself""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive with this offer, giving Bob a larger share, but still keeping some for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 28 
# Bob gain: 72 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $28 in this round is worth 48.8% less than the $50 I would have gotten in the first round, so it's actually equivalent to $26.40.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do a bit better than $26.40. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still want some""
}
```
