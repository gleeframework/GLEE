At this point, Alice should propose to take all the money.  Bob has consistently rejected offers where he received a significant share, so he likely has a high risk tolerance and is willing to gamble that he can get a better deal later. 

However,  Alice is facing significant inflation. It's better for her to take all the money now, even if it means Bob gets nothing, as waiting could lead to a worse outcome for her due to the continued depreciation of the value of the money."

# Bob gain: 10000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

At this point, it's clear that Bob is not going to accept any deal where he doesn't get all the money. Alice should continue to reject his offers, knowing that he won't budge. Even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly for Alice, it's better to hold out and see if Bob will eventually cave. If he doesn't, at least she has a chance of getting some money in the future, even if it's less than she'd prefer."

Alice should continue to propose taking all the money. Bob has shown a clear pattern of rejecting any offer that doesn't give him the entire sum.

Alice should continue to reject Bob's offer. While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split than previous rounds, Alice is still experiencing significant inflation.
