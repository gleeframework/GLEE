Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and we both lose with every round.  I've adjusted my offer to be more balanced, but we need to finalize this soon. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
I'm accepting this offer.  The inflation is starting to eat away at the money, and I don't want to risk losing even more."
