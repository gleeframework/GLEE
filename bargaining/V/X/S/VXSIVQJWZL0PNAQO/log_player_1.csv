Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy in the first round and see if Bob is willing to accept a small share.  I'll keep 90% for myself and offer him 10%.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting less in the next round."
