Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I rejected Alice's offer, it's my turn to make a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Alice 40, which is a bit more than her previous offer, and I'm keeping 60 for myself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value faster than I expected!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Alice's offer. Since I'm getting 35, which is a significant portion of the remaining amount, I'll accept it.
