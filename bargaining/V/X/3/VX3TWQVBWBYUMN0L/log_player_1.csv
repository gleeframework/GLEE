Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start with a generous offer, giving Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to keep more money, the inflation has devalued my potential gains significantly. It's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting even less in the next round."
