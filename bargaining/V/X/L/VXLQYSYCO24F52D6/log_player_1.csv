"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, reflecting my slightly greater contribution to this game.  Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 40% gain, especially considering the inflation effect. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the risk of inflation. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses more value."
