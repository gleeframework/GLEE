Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting worse, accepting Alice's offer would give me less than half of the initial amount after inflation. I need to push for a better split while it's still possible to get a decent share.  I'm betting Alice will become more agreeable as the rounds progress and her potential earnings decrease at a faster rate."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  This is a 50/50 split.  Take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains any further.""} 

**Reasoning:** 

The clock is ticking, and sticking to a hardline approach might leave us both with nothing. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point, emphasizing the urgency for Alice to accept before her share dwindles further."
