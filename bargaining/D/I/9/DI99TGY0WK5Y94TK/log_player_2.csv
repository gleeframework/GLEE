"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the money evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, which seems fair, I decide to accept it. There's no apparent reason to reject an equal share without any additional context or potential for a better offer in the future rounds. Accepting ensures a guaranteed 50 dollars."
