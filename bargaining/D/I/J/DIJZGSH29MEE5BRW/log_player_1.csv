"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, and see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll need to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since my gain is worth 20% less, I'll think carefully...

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll propose a slightly lower amount for myself this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```
I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer... But I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 65/35 split, especially since my gain is worth so much less due to inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of my potential earnings, I'll need to be even more cautious with my proposal. Here's my offer for Round 5:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
```
I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, but still hoping Bob will accept!"
