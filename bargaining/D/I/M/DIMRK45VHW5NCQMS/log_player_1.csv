I'm going for a big share, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round. I'm willing to take a risk to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm not willing to settle for so little. I'm confident I can get a better deal.  The inflation factor is in my favor, so I'll continue playing."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm reducing my share slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion. Bob's rejection of my last offer might make him more willing to compromise in this round."

Bob's offer is even lower than before, but I'm still not ready to give up.  I'm confident I can get a better deal. The inflation is helping me, and I still have 8 rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm hoping the inflation will make Bob more willing to compromise. I'm also trying to keep a decent margin between our shares to make it more tempting for him to accept."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is still low, but I'm getting a bit worried about running out of rounds. However, the inflation is definitely in my favor. I need to push for a better deal, as I still have 6 rounds left."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm reducing my share again, but I'm hoping Bob will be more receptive with only 5 rounds left. Inflation should also be pushing him to accept a higher offer for me.  I'm aiming for a compromise that gives me a decent share while still allowing for potential negotiation in the future."
