Let's see what I can get!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm going to take a more favorable approach this round.  I'll offer Alice 400,000 and keep 600,000 for myself.  Let's see if she bites."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Let's take the deal.  While the offer isn't ideal, it's better than the risk of another round of inflation and further loss."
