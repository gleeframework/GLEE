Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more evenly.  I'm willing to take a little less to avoid losing more money later on. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
