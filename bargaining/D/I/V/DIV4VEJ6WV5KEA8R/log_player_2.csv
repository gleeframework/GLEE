{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too much in your favor. Let's be reasonable - I propose a 55/45 split.  This accounts for the time value of money with the inflation working against us.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's call it even. 50/50 is a fair compromise considering the inflation we're both facing.  No more back and forth, let's just split it evenly. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
