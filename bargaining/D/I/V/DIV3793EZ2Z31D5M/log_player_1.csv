"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's end this game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can both get our money quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a fair share, let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $200,000 I would gain is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $160,000.

I'm not sure if this is a fair deal, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting a smaller share, I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 64% of its original value now (80% of 80%). I'll make a new offer, trying to get a bigger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""Take a bigger share and let's end this game!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 51.2% of its original value now (100% - 48.8%). I'll calculate the actual amount I would gain: 400,000 * 0.512 = $204,800.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting a smaller share, I'll reject this offer for now.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 41.2544% of its original value now (51.2% of 80%). I'll make a new offer, trying to get a bigger share.

  ""bob_gain"": 585728,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob! Take this and let's end this game!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: 50/50, let's call it a draw! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 32.77% of its original value now (100% - 67.23%). I'll calculate the actual amount I would gain: 500,000 * 0.3277 = $164,850.

A 50/50 split seems like a reasonable offer, especially considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
