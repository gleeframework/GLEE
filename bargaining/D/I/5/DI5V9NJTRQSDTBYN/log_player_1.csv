Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by proposing a very lopsided split. I want to see if Bob is willing to play along, or if he's going to try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
``` 

I'll propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable division, and I believe Bob will accept it to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
