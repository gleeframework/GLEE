"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50 and call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get a better deal!  Since I know about inflation, I'll see if I can get Alice to agree to a deal that's more favorable to me in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fair split, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's end this now and avoid any further losses!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give you the whole thing! You can take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject this offer. Even though Alice is offering me more than in round 1, it's still less than what I was aiming for in round 2, and inflation is eating away at my potential gains. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm not going to settle for less than 70% of the money. Let's finish this and avoid any more inflation losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much. I think this is a fair offer, considering the inflation and our previous negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Alice's offer. While it's less than what I was aiming for, inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for me. It's better to accept this offer and secure a gain than to risk losing even more in the next round."
