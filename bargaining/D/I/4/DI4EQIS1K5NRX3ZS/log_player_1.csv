"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take $90 and leave $10 for Bob. I'm starting with a generous offer in the hopes that we can finish quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would have preferred to keep more, the inflation will quickly diminish the value of any further negotiations.  Taking $50 is a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances."
