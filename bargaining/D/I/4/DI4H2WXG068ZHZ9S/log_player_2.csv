"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  Alice's money is losing value faster than mine. Delay benefits me.
* **Fairness with Urgency:**  My offer is a bit more in my favor, but it's still a significant amount for Alice, especially considering the rapid devaluation.  
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and emphasizes that accepting now is in both of our best interests."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While not ideal, the longer we wait, the less value the money holds, especially for Alice. 
* **Strategic Retreat:**  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of devaluation and is willing to make a slightly better offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a significantly better offer in further rounds is very risky now, as the money will continue to lose value rapidly."
