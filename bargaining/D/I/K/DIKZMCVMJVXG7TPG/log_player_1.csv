"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken its toll!

I don't think this offer is any better than my previous one, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 950000,
  ""bob_gain"": 50000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm trying to take advantage of the reduced value of the money due to inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is actually a decent one. I'll accept this offer.
