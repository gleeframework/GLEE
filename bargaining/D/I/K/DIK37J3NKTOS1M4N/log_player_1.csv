Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm offering Bob a small amount to see if he'll bite.  It's a risky strategy, but with inflation coming, I want to get as much as possible before it eats away at my share!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is eating away at my share quickly. Accepting this offer means I'll still get a decent amount, and it's better than waiting another round and risking losing even more."
