  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the $10,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game here."

Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it down the middle, huh? That's a reasonable proposal. I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. I'll take the $1000 and call it a day. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
