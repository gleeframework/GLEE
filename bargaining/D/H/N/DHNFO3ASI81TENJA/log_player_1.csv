"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Take the smaller share and we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer. Let's start with this, and we can adjust further if needed. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the numbers are:

My gain: 4000 * 0.95 = 3800
Bob's gain: 6000 * 0.8 = 4800

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
