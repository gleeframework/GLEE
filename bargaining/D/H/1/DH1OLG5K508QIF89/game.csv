600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to start.  It's a significant portion for both of us, and we can avoid losses from inflation by settling now.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, your offer was tempting, but I think we can find a fairer split. I propose 55/45 in my favor. It's still a win-win considering the decreasing value.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the offer, Bob, I believe a more equitable split is possible.  Let's see what the next round brings.",Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, let's meet in the middle. I'll agree to the 55/45 split, but in my favor this time.  The clock is ticking on the value of this money.",Alice,3,

475000.0,525000.0,"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor.  This reflects a slight advantage to me for initiating negotiations, but is fair given the time pressure.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I understand your point, but that difference is still too significant for me. Let's not be hasty, we still have time to reach a more agreeable outcome.",Alice,4,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, this is a serious offer. 51/49 in my favor. It's a small edge, but we're running out of time and losing money with every passing round.",Alice,5,
