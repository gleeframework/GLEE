"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a generous offer given the initial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In the third round, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll aim for a more aggressive split to account for the reduced value.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is accelerating!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll need to be cautious.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
