While a 50/50 split is fair, I want to try and negotiate a better deal for myself, considering the inflation risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than an even split.  Let's try 60/40, recognizing the inflation risk.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I propose a slightly higher allocation for you, aiming for a more equitable distribution. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I prefer more, accepting this offer gives me a better deal than the previous round and avoids risking further inflation."
