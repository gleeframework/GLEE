"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can't do better than this.""
}
```

This is a relatively fair offer, but I'm trying to keep a bit more for myself to have some bargaining power for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said I couldn't do better, let's see about that! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to come back so strongly! Given that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, this offer is actually quite aggressive.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will come back with something more reasonable.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to take a firmer stance and propose a slightly more uneven split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You wanted to test me, now it's my turn to test you. This is my best offer.""
}
```

This offer is still relatively close to the initial 60-40 split, but I'm trying to assert my dominance by taking a slightly larger share. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think this is your best offer? I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really pushing his luck! Given that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth a whopping 48.8% less, this offer is actually quite generous from his perspective.

However, I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more of the pie. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will come back with something more reasonable.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It seems like Bob is trying to wear me down with his aggressive offers. I'll try to take a more moderate stance and propose a slightly more even split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. This is a fair offer, don't you think?""
}
```

This offer is a bit more even than my previous ones, but I'm still trying to keep a slight edge. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about finding a middle ground. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is really trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of the deal. Given that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is now worth a staggering 67.23% less, this offer is actually quite lopsided in his favor.

I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more of the pie, especially since Bob's gain is now worth so much less. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will come back with something more reasonable.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive, but I'm not going to back down. I'll make one last attempt to propose a fair deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Let's split it 50-50 and be done with it.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is the most even split possible. I'm hoping Bob will see reason and accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to walk away if he rejects it."
