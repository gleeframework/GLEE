"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. You can try to negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll be motivated to negotiate and we can reach a better agreement for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair, Alice.  Let's get this done quickly before the money starts to lose value. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to get the game over quickly, but I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best I can get.

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50/50 is the best I can get, Bob. I'll pass on this offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 10% toll, the money is now worth 90% of its original value. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need to get a bigger portion than your previous offer.  Time is running out! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money's value decreasing rapidly, Bob's offer seems more appealing. However, I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 40/60 split, Bob. I think I can do better than that.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer, trying to squeeze a bit more for myself:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I need to get a better share to make this worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but we need to move forward with a deal.  The money keeps getting worth less each round, and we don't want to end up with nothing! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money's value is decreasing rapidly, and Bob's offer seems like a decent compromise. I'll accept his offer, hoping it's the best I can get at this point:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. I'll take 45. It's better than nothing, and we can finally end this game.""
}
```"
