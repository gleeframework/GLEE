"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, and we can negotiate further if you want.""
}
```

I'm proposing a split where I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a slightly more aggressive offer. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than $4,000, but I don't want to give him too much. I'll try to negotiate a bit.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is a bit too aggressive. I can meet you halfway, but I'll propose a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's try to find a compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to squeeze a bit more out of this. Meet me at the halfway point, but I'll take a slight edge. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money I gain now worth only 51.2% of its original value, I need to be even more careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I don't think I can accept it. I was already at 55% of the original value in the previous round, and now I'd be giving up even more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too aggressive, especially considering the inflation. I'm not willing to give up that much more.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation eating away at my potential gain, I'll try to be even more aggressive in my next offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate. I'll give you most of the money, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of.""
}
```"
