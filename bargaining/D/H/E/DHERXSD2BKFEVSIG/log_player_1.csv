Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're reaching a critical point. I'm increasing my offer slightly to demonstrate good faith. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is using classic negotiation tactics, leveraging time pressure against me.  While his offer is slowly increasing, it's not increasing at a rate that makes up for the inflation hitting my potential gains.  I need to hold firm and signal I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds to secure a deal that accounts for the inflation disadvantage I'm facing."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm making another concession, but this is my final offer.  Let's be reasonable and end this before we both get burned by the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5050 
# Bob gain: 4950 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While still not ideal, Bob's offer now surpasses the 50/50 mark. Accepting guarantees a slightly favorable outcome for me considering the substantial inflation already incurred. Holding out further risks even less favorable offers from Bob, or worse, reaching no deal and both getting nothing.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a win, even if it's a small one."
