Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. Let's split it a little closer to even, 55 for me and 45 for you. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out and the money is losing value. I'm sticking with my previous offer of 60/40.  It's a fair deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly this time.  We both lose more money if we keep rejecting offers. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
Even though it's not the ideal split, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is better than risking getting a worse offer or running out of rounds.  The longer the game goes on the less money we both get."
