I'm offering Bob $50,000 and keeping $950,000 for myself. It's a pretty generous offer considering I'm taking the risk of him rejecting it and potentially getting a better deal in the next round.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's painful, but I have to accept. I've lost a lot of money due to inflation, and it's only going to get worse.  It's better to take $1 than risk getting nothing in the next round!"
