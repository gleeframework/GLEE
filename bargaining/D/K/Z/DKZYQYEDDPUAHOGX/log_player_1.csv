"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000 / 100,000 split in my favor.  This seems fair, as I am the one making the initial offer.  Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, even with the inflation effects. I'm not going to accept a deal where I get 100,000, while he gets 900,000! Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm going to make a counter offer, accounting for the inflation. I propose a 720,000 / 280,000 split, which is still a significant advantage for me, but recognizes that Bob will likely be less willing to accept a heavily unbalanced offer in his favor this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even with the inflation, this is the best offer I've seen.  Bob has gained a lot of bargaining power by pushing us to this round.  While I would have liked to get more, I think it's better to accept and take the 300,000 than to risk getting nothing at all in future rounds."
