Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that inflation is affecting your share, but I'm not going to accept an offer that doesn't reflect my initial advantage. This is my counteroffer. 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough decision, but with the increasing impact of inflation, it's getting too risky. Accepting Alice's offer is the best move at this point, even though it's not ideal."
