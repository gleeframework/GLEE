"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm already down to 40% of the initial amount, I'll have to think carefully about my next move.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and try to negotiate further. I'd like to aim for a higher share of the remaining money."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 20/80, I'll try to counter with a slightly more aggressive proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 45/55 is a more reasonable split.""}

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, another rejection! Bob's offer is getting closer to his initial 80/20 proposal, but I'm still not happy with the 30/70 split.

Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer and try to push for a better deal.

I'll think carefully about my next move, taking into account the decreasing value of the money and trying to find a sweet spot where I can get a decent share."

# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, Bob is really squeezing me now! With the money's value decreasing rapidly, I'm getting desperate. I don't like the 15/85 split, but I'm running out of options.

Considering the dire situation, I'll decide to {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer. I'll take the 15 and hope that it's enough to make it worth my while."
