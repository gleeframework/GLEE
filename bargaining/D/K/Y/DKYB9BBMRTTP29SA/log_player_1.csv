# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is finally feeling the heat of inflation and offering a larger portion of the shrinking pie.  He's clearly anxious to end the game. I'll hold out for a bit longer to see if I can secure an even better deal as his position continues to weaken."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I'm taking a big risk with the inflation, but I need to get a decent share to make this worthwhile. Accept this, or we both risk losing a lot more. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's finally happened. The relentless pressure of inflation has forced Bob to make a desperate offer. While it's not ideal, accepting 20% is better than risking a worse outcome in subsequent rounds. It's clear Bob is at his limit, and further negotiation might lead to a total breakdown of the deal."
