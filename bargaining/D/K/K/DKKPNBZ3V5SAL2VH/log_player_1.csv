"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with. It's a fair and simple proposal.""}

I'm proposing to split the $100 equally between us, with each of us getting $50. This is a straightforward and fair proposal, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small lead, but I'm still looking for a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the current value of the money. Considering the 5% decrease in value for Bob's gain, I think I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I think this is a fair compromise.""}

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than my initial proposal, but still a decent chunk of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, but I'm willing to make a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more aggressive!

Considering the significant decrease in value of the money Bob gains, I'm not thrilled with his offer. However, I'm running out of time, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'm not happy about it.
