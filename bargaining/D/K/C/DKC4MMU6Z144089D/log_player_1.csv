I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a tough one.  While I'd be happy to get anything at this point, it's clear Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll reject and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm lowering my demands, but still trying to get a decent share. Hopefully, Bob sees the value of a deal sooner rather than later."
