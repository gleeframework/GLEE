"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer for myself, but I'm leaving Bob a small amount to make it more likely he'll accept.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my previous offer, and I don't want to accept such a drastic reduction.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep price.  I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a significant portion for myself.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that he needs to compromise if he wants to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While I'm losing money with every round, this offer is still too low for me. I'm hoping Bob will recognize that he needs to give me a better deal, or risk getting nothing in the end. I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a good deal.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize that he needs to compromise soon, or we'll both end up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a much better offer than the previous ones, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds. I'll accept this offer and secure a decent amount of money."
