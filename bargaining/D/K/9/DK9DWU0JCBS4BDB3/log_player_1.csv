"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
I'm going to start by offering a very unbalanced split. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share right away, or if he's going to play the long game and wait for his turn to propose.  I also want to take advantage of the inflation factor and get as much money as possible before it loses value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, I don't want to risk losing even more due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get a fair share, even though it's less than my initial proposal."
