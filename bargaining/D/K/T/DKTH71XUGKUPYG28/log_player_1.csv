"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something more balanced. This is a good deal before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit less than before, but still more than you offered""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm taking into account the inflation that has occurred so far. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less each round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less each round, I'm trying to find a balance that still favors me but is more reasonable considering the decreasing value of the money. My message is an attempt to justify my proposal and persuade Bob to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's wrap this up. This is a reasonable offer considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer in Round 4. Given the impact of inflation on the value of the money, where my gain is worth 14.26% less and Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I believe this offer is reasonable. The difference in the loss of value due to inflation between us is significant, and accepting this offer ensures I receive a portion of the money before its value decreases further. The offer of 48 for me and 52 for Bob seems balanced under these circumstances, and it's better to secure this amount now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
