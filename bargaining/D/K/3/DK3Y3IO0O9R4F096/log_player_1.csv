"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a 50/50 split, and I'd rather get something now than risk losing everything in future rounds. 

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
