"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 400,000 and give you 600,000. That sounds like a good compromise to me. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
