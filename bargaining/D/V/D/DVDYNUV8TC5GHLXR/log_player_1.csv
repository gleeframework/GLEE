"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, as it ensures both of us get a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I am losing value with each passing round, Bob is losing value at twice the rate. This offer still leaves him with a significantly larger share of the money, and I believe I can negotiate a more equitable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000} 
```

I propose a 450,000 / 550,000 split. This is a compromise, considering the inflation we're both facing.  It's still a good amount for me, and it offers Bob a much better deal than the previous round."
