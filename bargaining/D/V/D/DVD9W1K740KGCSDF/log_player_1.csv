"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. This gives me a slight advantage, but still offers Bob a significant share, considering the value of money will decrease over time. My message, ""Let's be reasonable,"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept this offer early on, avoiding further devaluation of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be more fair. This is a good start, let's work together. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because accepting 40% of the money, which is now worth 20% less due to inflation, is less favorable than my initial proposal. Given the significant decrease in value for me and the relatively minor decrease for Bob, I believe I can negotiate for a better split in subsequent rounds. Additionally, accepting this early in the game might leave me at a disadvantage, considering the potential for future negotiations. I'll proceed to the next round to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway""}\n\nGiven the inflation and the fact that Bob also faces a decrease in value, albeit smaller, I'll propose a slightly more favorable offer to Bob than my initial one, while still aiming for a larger share. By suggesting to ""meet me halfway,"" I'm attempting to convey a sense of compromise and flexibility, hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable step towards a mutually acceptable agreement. This approach also takes into account the pressure of future inflation, encouraging a decision sooner rather than later."
