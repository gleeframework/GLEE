"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave Bob with 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, and Bob's offer is 70, I'll effectively get 70 * 0.95 = 66.5 dollars.

And since Bob's gain is worth 20% less, he'll effectively get 30 * 0.8 = 24 dollars.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
