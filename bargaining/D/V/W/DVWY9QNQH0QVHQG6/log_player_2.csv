"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take this small amount and we can end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer is tempting, it's highly unlikely Alice will keep being this generous, especially as the money is worth less to her with each round.  I'd rather see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice.  Fair is fair, and we both get a decent chunk.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, Bob.  Let's end this before inflation eats away any more of our money. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer is better than the first round, it still feels very lopsided in Alice's favor. I'll see what she offers in the next round. The inflation is starting to work in my favor, and I'm hoping for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this split is more fair considering the inflation we're facing.  We can end this quickly and avoid losing more money.""}
