Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's time to turn the tables! This offer is fair and keeps inflation at bay for both of us. Let's end this game now.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we've both been playing this game for a while now. Let's be realistic. This is the best we can both do with inflation in mind. Accept and we can both move on. 
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer seems better due to the rapid decrease in his potential gain from inflation, it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  I believe I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round. Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation and is more likely to accept a less favorable offer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it before inflation eats away even more of your potential winnings. It's a fair deal that benefits us both.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Bob. This offer is still beneficial to me but gives Bob a larger share than his previous offer, which was already heavily impacted by inflation. He'll likely be more open to accepting a less favorable deal now than he will be in subsequent rounds when inflation further erodes his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we've been through this. Inflation is eating away at my share, and this is the best I can offer while still being fair. Let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but I have to acknowledge the reality of the situation. While Bob's offer is far from ideal, it's better than what I could likely secure in the next round. Inflation is severely impacting his potential gains, making my negotiating position weaker. Accepting this offer cuts my losses and ensures I receive something rather than risking a worse outcome if the game continues."
