Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor.  It's unlikely Bob will accept, but I'm hoping to get the negotiation started. I'll be watching closely for any signs of inflation affecting him.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  I'm getting half the money, and while Bob's share is less valuable due to inflation, it's still a significant amount.  It's better to take this offer than to risk further rounds and potential losses."
