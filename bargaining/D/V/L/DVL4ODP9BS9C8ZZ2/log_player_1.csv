I propose a split of 9000 for myself and 1000 for Bob. I'm hoping this will be seen as a fair starting point, giving me the majority while still offering Bob something. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer. Bob's offer is far too one-sided. It seems he is attempting to be greedy and will need to negotiate more reasonably for us to reach an agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time. I'm willing to give up a significant portion of my previous gain to demonstrate my willingness to compromise. I hope Bob will see this as a fair deal and accept it."
