Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a big share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it would be nice to get a bigger share, it's not worth risking it further with inflation.  Taking the $1000 is better than potentially getting nothing in later rounds."
