Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer in my favor.  Since we have so many rounds, I want to establish a pattern of me getting the lion's share.  This will hopefully make Bob more likely to accept my offers in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While it would be nice to get more than 500,000, it's a good deal considering the uncertainty of inflation on Bob's side. Accepting now guarantees half the money, which is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
