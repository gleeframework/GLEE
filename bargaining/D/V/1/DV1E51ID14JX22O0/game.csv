6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer. I propose we take $6,000 and you take $4,000.  This way we both benefit from dividing the money early.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Let's try to find a middle ground. Since the money loses value over time, let's split it in a way that considers this.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5800.0,4200.0,"Time is running out, and the money is losing value.  I propose $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you. It's a bit closer to my initial offer, but still accounts for the time pressure.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Considering the time pressure and inflation, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly in my favor this time. Let's settle on this before the money loses even more value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, we're running out of time. This offer is a compromise, taking into account the shrinking pot.  Let's agree now so we both walk away with something substantial.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"We're halfway through the rounds, and the money is losing value fast. I'm willing to take a bit more risk to get a better deal. This might be the last chance for a reasonable split.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
5400.0,4600.0,"Bob, it's getting critical. We both lose if this goes on. This offer is still tilted in your favor compared to a fair split considering inflation, but it's the best I can do at this point.  Let's be rational and end this.",Alice,7,
