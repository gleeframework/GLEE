"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (99%) and leaves a small amount for Bob. I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize him to accept, as he gets something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have more, accepting this offer is the best option given the inflation and the fact that I have no guarantee of getting more in future rounds. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome in this scenario."
