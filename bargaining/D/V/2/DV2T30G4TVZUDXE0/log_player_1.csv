"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to consider that my gain is worth 5% less, so I'm actually getting $38 (40 x 0.95).

Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for me, considering I'm getting less value due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher amount to account for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair split!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 42, but I'm still not satisfied 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll! My gain is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'm actually getting $43.02 (42 x 0.8574).

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm willing to accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.
