"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```
This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm proposing that Bob gets 30% of the original $100. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain is now 0.95 * 70 = 66.5. Bob's offer is still a bit better than my original proposal, but I'm not sure if I want to give up that much.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain is now 0.95 * 0.95 * 70 = 64.525. Here's my new proposal for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain is now 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 70 = 58.3545.

Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to me this time, but I'm not sure if I want to give up 40% of the remaining value.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 19.51% less than in the first round, my gain is now 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 0.95 * 70 = 53.689225.

Here's my new proposal for Round 5:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
