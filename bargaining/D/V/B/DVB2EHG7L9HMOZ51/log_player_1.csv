"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me taking the larger share. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division, while also acknowledging that I'm taking a bit more. The idea is to start with a proposal that is somewhat favorable to me, but still leaves room for negotiation. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can afford to be a bit more aggressive in my initial offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is better.  Let's be fair to each other. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince Bob's offer gives me 45 dollars, and I started by offering myself 60 dollars, I think I can do better. Additionally, Bob's message suggests that they want a more even split, but their offer still gives them a slightly larger share. Given that the money doesn't lose value for me, I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob, while still keeping the larger share for myself. Since Bob's previous offer gave them 55 dollars, I'll offer them a bit less than that, in the hopes that they'll find it acceptable. I'll also include a message that suggests we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Getting closer to a fair deal, let's compromise""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle. I think that's the fairest way to do this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Now that Bob is offering a 50-50 split, I have to consider the fact that the money doesn't lose value for me, but it does for Bob. Since we're already in the fourth round, Bob's share is worth 14.26% less than it was initially. This means that if I accept this offer, I'll actually end up with more value than Bob, even though the nominal amounts are equal. Given this, I think I can do better by holding out for a more favorable deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob offered a 50-50 split in the previous round, I'll try to make a slightly more generous offer, while still taking advantage of the fact that the money doesn't lose value for me. I'll offer Bob a bit less than 50 dollars, and include a message that suggests we're close to a deal.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Almost there, let's finalize the deal""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
