Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive offer, aiming for a large share of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also prepared for him to counter-propose.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, I'm aware that the money is losing value with each round. Accepting this offer is the best way to guarantee I get some money, even if it's less than I initially hoped for. The loss in value for Bob makes it more likely he'll accept my future offer, if we move on to another round."
