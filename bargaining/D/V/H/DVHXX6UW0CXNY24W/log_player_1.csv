"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me a 60% share of the initial $1,000,000, which seems like a fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share of $300,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. This is a significant reduction.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 30% share of the reduced amount.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation effect, my previous offer of $600,000 would be worth even less now, so I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me a 55% share of the initial $1,000,000, which is a bit more than my initial offer. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! My share of $550,000 in the first round is now worth only 72.9% of its original value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll think about it. The fact that Bob is offering me $450,000 now, which is 45% of the remaining amount, is a good sign. However, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money. My previous offer of $550,000 is now worth even less.

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Since Bob rejected my previous offers, I'll try to push for a higher share.

Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 650000,
  ""bob_gain"": 350000
}
```

This offer gives me a 65% share of the initial $1,000,000, which is a bit more than my previous offer. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. My previous offer of $650,000 is now worth only 59.05% of its original value.

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer of $400,000 seems like a reasonable deal. It's a 40% share of the remaining amount, which is a decent split considering the inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
