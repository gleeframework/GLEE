"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this offer seems generous, it's important to consider the potential of future rounds and the inflation factor. Rejecting allows me to potentially get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a good starting point to move forward.  Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle and move forward. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation factor is starting to bite.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's better than risking another round and possibly getting a worse deal."
