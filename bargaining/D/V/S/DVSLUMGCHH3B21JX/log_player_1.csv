Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 60/40 split is fairer, considering we both have a chance to propose.  Let's move forward with this, and avoid the risk of further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
