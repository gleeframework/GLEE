"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This is a generous offer considering the potential for inflation.  I believe it's in Bob's best interest to accept this offer and avoid the risk of getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm proposing an 8000/2000 split. While Bob's offer was tempting, I believe I can still get a better deal. This offer is still fair considering the inflation and the possibility of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I could have gotten in earlier rounds.  I'm willing to risk a bit more to try and secure a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a 7000/3000 split. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, reflecting the increasing inflation. However, I believe it's still a fair deal considering the risks of getting nothing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is still less than I was hoping for, but I'm not ready to settle for such a low amount just yet. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm proposing a 6000/4000 split.  Inflation is hitting hard, but I believe I can still get a decent share of the money.  This offer is still relatively generous considering the potential for getting nothing in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a significant reduction from my initial goal, the inflation is taking a heavy toll.  I'm not confident I can get a better deal in the remaining rounds, so I'll accept this offer to ensure I get something."
