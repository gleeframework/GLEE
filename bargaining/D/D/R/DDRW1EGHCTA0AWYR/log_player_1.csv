"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I'm still trying to get a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth even less, so I need to be careful.

I'll reject this offer. I'm not getting enough from this deal, and I'd rather wait for a better proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation still eating away at the value of the money, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. This is my best offer. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80-20 split, which is a bit more skewed towards me, but I think it's still a reasonable offer given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger either! I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to get a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With my gain being worth only 51.2% of what it was in the first round, I need to be careful not to get too greedy.

I'll reject this offer as well. While it's a slightly better split than my previous offer, I'm not sure if it's enough to make it worth accepting, especially considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I need to be even more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, and I'm not getting any more generous. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing an 85-15 split, which is a very favorable split for me, but I think it's necessary given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get worried about the inflation, but I'll give you a bit more. Let's try to make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 78 
# Bob gain: 22 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With my gain being worth only 32.77% of what it was in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

However, I think this offer is the best one I've seen so far, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better one. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
