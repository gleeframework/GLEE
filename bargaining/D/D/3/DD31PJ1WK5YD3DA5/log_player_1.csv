"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a 40% share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice's gain: $5,000 x 0.95 = $4,750
Bob's gain: $5,000 x 0.95 = $4,750

I'll accept Bob's offer.
