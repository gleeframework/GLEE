"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll need to reassess the offer.

In this round, the $1,000,000 is worth $900,000 (due to 10% inflation from the previous round).

Bob's offer is 50% each, which is a fair split, but I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than the original amount ($900,000), I'll make a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering to take 55% of the current value, leaving Bob with 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original amount ($729,000), I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Bob's offer is 48% for me and 52% for him. It's a slight increase in my share compared to the previous round, but still a bit lower than my previous offer.
