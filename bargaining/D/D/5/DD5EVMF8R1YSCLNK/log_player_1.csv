Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very aggressive opening offer.  I want to maximize my share, knowing that Bob's money will be worth less in the next round.  I'm confident that he'll accept this, as even a small amount is better than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to get more, it's not worth risking getting nothing at all. Bob's offer is fair and it guarantees me a sizable share of the money.  It's also likely that if I reject this, Bob will become even more aggressive in future rounds, making it riskier for me."
