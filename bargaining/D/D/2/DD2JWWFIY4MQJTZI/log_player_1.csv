"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```
I'm proposing a 4:1 split, which is a fairly generous offer considering the initial amount is $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll consider Bob's offer. Since I'm getting $7,000, which is 70% of the original amount, I think it's a reasonable offer considering the decreased value of money.
