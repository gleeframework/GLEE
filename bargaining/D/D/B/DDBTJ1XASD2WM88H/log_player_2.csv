Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed hitting you hard, but I'm not going 50/50. This is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning: 

At this point, the effects of inflation are significantly impacting Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer results in a better outcome than continuing to play and risking even greater losses to inflation.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Each round sees a significant decrease in the actual value of Bob's potential winnings due to inflation.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has been consistently unwilling to move to a truly 50/50 split. It's unlikely she'll make a significantly better offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk of getting an even worse deal in the future, making the current offer relatively more attractive."
