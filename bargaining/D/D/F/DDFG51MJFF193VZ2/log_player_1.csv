I propose to keep $90 and give Bob $10.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate in the next round if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 81, ""bob_gain"": 19}
``` 

I'm reducing my offer slightly to account for the inflation.  However, I still believe it's a fair deal."
