Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 90/10 in my favor. It's a fair start, and I'm sure we can work out a better deal later.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide the money 45/55 in your favor. This ensures a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
