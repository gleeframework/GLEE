Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more than half. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, Alice is consistently offering deals where she gets significantly more.  Even with the inflation working against me, holding out for a better offer is still the best play. Accepting now would mean losing a large chunk of the potential money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be real.  The inflation is eating my share away. I'm proposing a perfectly even split.  Take it or leave it - we both lose if this keeps going.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know you're losing value, but I'm not budging much. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to offer a better deal at this point. She knows I'm getting desperate as inflation eats into my potential gains. Accepting this offer, while not ideal, secures me something rather than risking a complete loss if we run out of rounds."
