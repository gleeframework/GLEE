"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll take 55 dollars and Bob can have 45 dollars. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division, with me taking a bit more. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer to split it down the middle, since the money is losing value for me each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer of a 45-55 split. Since the money is worth the same to me in each round, I have no incentive to accept a lower amount than what I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll make a new proposal.\n\nLet's move on to Round 3! I'll make a new offer. \n\n### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more, considering the value of money isn't changing for me""}\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
