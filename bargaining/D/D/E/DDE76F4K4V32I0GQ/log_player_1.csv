"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a division of $999,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, as it guarantees me a large share while giving Bob something to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, this is a fair and even split. Accepting ensures we both get something, especially considering the risk of inflation."
