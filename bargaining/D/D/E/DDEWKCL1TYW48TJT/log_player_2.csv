Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share,  the inflation is making Alice's offer increasingly more attractive. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
