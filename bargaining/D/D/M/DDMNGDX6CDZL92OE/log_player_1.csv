Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll offer a better deal for both of us. We'll split the money evenly, and I'll make sure we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money is worth the same to me, I'll offer the same deal as before. We'll split the money evenly, and I'll make sure we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is better than risking another round where the value decreases further for me.
