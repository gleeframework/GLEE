"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate, let's end the game now!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can't do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get 40, which is worth 95% of what I would have gotten in the first round (due to the 5% inflation). That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should hold out for a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to do better in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me again, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, hoping to get a better deal in return. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not done yet! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. My gain of 42 is worth 83.74% of what I would have gotten in the first round (due to the 14.26% inflation). That's a decent offer, but I'm still not sure if I should hold out for a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth even less for me, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 43,
  ""bob_gain"": 57,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to get a better deal in return. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice, but I'm still not done negotiating! 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. My gain of 38 is worth 62.4% of what I would have gotten in the first round (due to the 22.62% inflation). That's a decent offer, but I'm still not sure if I should hold out for a better deal.

However, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint and the effects of inflation. I might be better off accepting this offer to get some money, rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds.
