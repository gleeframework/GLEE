"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more equitable. I'm offering a slightly closer split. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the new offer. I was hoping for a more significant increase in my share, considering the initial offer was already quite low. I'd like to make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the reduced value of the money""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $100 and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest solution, and we can both avoid further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob's offer is a good compromise, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Splitting the remaining $100 evenly seems like a fair solution, and I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiations."
