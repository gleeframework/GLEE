"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this split, especially considering the inflation. Can you offer something better?""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I'd like to see if Bob can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be strategic with my next offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. But I'm not getting any younger, so I'd like to get a decent share too.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52-48 split in my favor, with me getting $5,200 and Bob getting $4,800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, let's make a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now! With the money being worth only 51.2% of its original value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to accept this 50-50 split. It's not ideal, but I think it's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, and we'll split the remaining $10,000 (which is now worth only $5,120 in real value) evenly."
