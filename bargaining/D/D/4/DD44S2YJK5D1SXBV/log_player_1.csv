"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:1 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money for myself."
