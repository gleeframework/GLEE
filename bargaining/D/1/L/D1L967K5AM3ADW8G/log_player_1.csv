"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can see how the game goes from here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's try a 60/40 split, but in my favor this time.  It's a fair chance for both of us to get a better deal than the last round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to flip the script!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, and Bob's offer is actually less favorable to me than the previous one, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'll aim to get a better deal this round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. 55/45 split seems fair to me.""
}
