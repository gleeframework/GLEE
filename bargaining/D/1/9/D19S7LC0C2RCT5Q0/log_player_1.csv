"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer.  I figure Bob is likely to reject it, but it sets the stage for negotiation and shows that I'm willing to be bold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a classic example of the ultimatum game, and it's clear Bob is trying to use the same strategy as me. I'm not going to accept a deal where I get such a small share, especially since there are still 10 rounds left. I'm confident that we can find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

This time, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's fair and should be more appealing to Bob than his last offer."
