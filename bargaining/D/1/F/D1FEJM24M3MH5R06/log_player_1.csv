"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's still fair to Bob. We'll see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While Bob's offer is more generous, it still represents a significant loss for me compared to my initial proposal. I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering an even split this time. The inflation is starting to take a toll, so I think it's best to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is making the potential gains in future rounds much lower. I'll accept this offer."
