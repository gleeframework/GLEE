"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, considering the inflation difference. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair initially, it's crucial to consider the inflation rates.  Since my money depreciates faster, I'm likely to get a better deal in the next round when I can make the proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm taking into account the inflation rates, and this offer should be more beneficial for both of us in the long run.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd ideally like a larger share, considering the decreasing value of money and the fact that I'll have to wait another round before proposing again, this offer seems like the best option. It's a fair compromise and mitigates the risk of losing a significant portion of the potential gain."
