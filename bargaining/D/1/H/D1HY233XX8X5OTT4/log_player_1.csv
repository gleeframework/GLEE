"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and I'll take the majority since I'm making the first offer.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, where I'll take 60 dollars and Bob will take 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still be generous 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with a 30/70 split, as I feel it's too skewed towards Bob. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it evenly this time. It's a fair compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which I think is a more reasonable and fair compromise."
