"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. How about a more even split this time? You'll still get a good chunk, and I'll get a bit more to make up for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
