"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my calculation. 

In the first round, I would have gained $700,000, but due to inflation, it's now worth 95% of that, which is $665,000. 

Bob's offer in the second round is $400,000 for me, which is worth 60% of the original $1,000,000. 

I'll accept this offer.
