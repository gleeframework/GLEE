"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the cash!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder to Bob that accepting this offer will get us both some money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer, let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making a decision. With the new offers, I'll be getting $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount, and Bob will get $700,000, which is 70% of the original amount.

Considering the inflation, I'll have to weigh the benefits of getting some money now versus waiting for a potentially better offer in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decreased value. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a bit more assertive, hoping to nudge Bob into accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 60/40! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game continues, and the money is losing value rapidly!

Considering the new offers, I'll calculate the effective values:

* My gain of $400,000 is worth 40% of the original $1,000,000, taking into account the 48.8% inflation.
* Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth 60% of the original $1,000,000, taking into account the 14.26% inflation.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer, which seems to be a compromise from Bob's previous offer. For now, I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
