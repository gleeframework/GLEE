Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for him. While his offer is closer to a fair split, I'm still in a strong position to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  It's a reasonable compromise considering the inflation working against you.  Let's close this deal and avoid further losses.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The goal here is to find a balance between maximizing my gain and ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  

* **Bob's desperation:**  With each round, Bob's position weakens significantly due to the rapid inflation affecting his potential earnings.  He's likely to be increasingly motivated to accept any reasonable offer.
* **Time sensitivity:** Prolonging the negotiation only benefits me. However, there's always a risk Bob might become resigned to accepting a smaller amount if I push too hard.
* **Compromise:** This offer is a slight concession from my previous offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still securing a favorable outcome.

By conveying a sense of urgency and finality, I aim to push Bob towards accepting this advantageous offer."
