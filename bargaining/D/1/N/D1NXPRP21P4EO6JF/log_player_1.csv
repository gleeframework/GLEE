"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, but I'll give you a chance to do better""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll want to negotiate for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair. It gives you a good share, and it leaves plenty for me.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in Round 1, which is $3,200.

I'm not thrilled with the 60/40 split, but Bob's message seems sincere, and I don't want to risk going to Round 3 with the value of the money decreasing further.
