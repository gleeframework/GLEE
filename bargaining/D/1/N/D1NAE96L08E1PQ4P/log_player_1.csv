"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a very aggressive opening offer, but I'm aiming to secure a large portion of the money early on. Since Bob's money is worth much less than yours with each passing round, I'm banking on him taking the deal and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is tempting, it's still too early to settle. The game has just begun, and I can still secure a better deal for myself. Bob's offer is a good starting point for negotiation, but I believe I can push for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still pushing for a larger share, but this time I'm offering Bob a bit more than my previous offer.  The inflation rate on his side is much higher, so I believe he might be more inclined to accept a deal that benefits him a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant decrease from the previous round. While he's feeling the sting of inflation more, I'm still in a much stronger position. I can afford to reject this offer and continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

This offer is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate. The inflation on Bob's side is becoming very high, and I'm hoping this offer will be enough to tempt him into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While the inflation on his side is getting severe, I'm still in a better position. I can afford to reject this offer and see if I can secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is a risky move, but I'm hoping Bob's desperation due to the increasing inflation will make him accept. He's losing a significant amount of value with each passing round. This offer is a further compromise, but I'm aiming for a deal that secures a large portion of the remaining value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a dramatic drop from the previous round. While I'm feeling the effects of inflation as well, I'm still in a better position than him. I believe I can secure a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

This is a significant concession on my part, but I need to secure a deal before the remaining rounds result in a much lower payout. I'm betting on Bob's desperate need for some value, even if it's a much smaller share than he initially hoped for."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is extremely low. Despite the significant inflation on Bob's side, I'm still in a better position. There are only two rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With only two rounds left, we are both facing severe inflation. This offer is a 50/50 split, which is the fairest option given the circumstances. If we don't reach an agreement, we risk getting nothing. I believe this is the most reasonable approach, as further negotiation could result in a worse outcome for both of us."
