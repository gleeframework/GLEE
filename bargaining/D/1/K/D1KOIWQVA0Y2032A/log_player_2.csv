Let's see what Alice offers in the next round.  It's too early to accept such a lopsided offer.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering Alice a 40/60 split.  This is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still pretty lopsided, even with inflation considered.  I'll hold out for a more even split.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm still aiming for a 60/40 split, but I'm willing to compromise a little bit. I'm increasing my offer to Bob to 550,000, hoping Alice will recognize that we're getting closer to a fair agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to be bullied. I'll stick to my principles and keep pushing for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

With inflation biting harder, I'm proposing an even 50/50 split. This is the fairest outcome considering the circumstances. Hopefully, Alice will realize that we both need to compromise to avoid losing everything."
