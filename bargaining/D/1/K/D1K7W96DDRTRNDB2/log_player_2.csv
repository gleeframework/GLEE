Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is decreasing, while yours are increasing. This doesn't seem fair given the inflation disparity. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
