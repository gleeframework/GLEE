"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair! I'm taking the majority, but you get a decent share.  Accept and we're done. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation. Alice gets significantly more with each passing round, while my gains are stagnant.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair amount, and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our gains.""}
