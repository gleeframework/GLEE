"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60-40, considering I'm starting 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share since you started, but this offer accounts for the decreasing value over time. Let's close the deal and both benefit!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my new offer is slightly lower than the initial one. Let's settle on 57-43 and call it a day! 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is barely budging while my potential gains are significantly decreasing. It's still better to hold out for a better offer that reflects the impact of inflation on my returns."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money in this game! I'm adjusting my offer again to be fair, but we need to agree soon before inflation eats away at the value. Deal?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're trying to rush, but I'm not desperate yet. 55-45 is my new offer, considering the inflation impact on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the inflation impact, but her offer is still skewed in her favor.  While the deal is getting closer to something acceptable, I need to show her I'm willing to risk it all to get a fairer share.  The shrinking pot means we both need to be more flexible."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is pointless. Let's split it 50/50 and end this now.  Every round that passes hurts us both.""}"
