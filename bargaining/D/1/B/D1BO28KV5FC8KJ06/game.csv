60.0,40.0,"Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good deal for both of us, especially considering the inflation.",Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"I think 60/40 is a bit biased, how about we do 55/45? It's still a good deal for you, and we should take into account that the money is losing value.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand you want a fair split, but the value is decreasing quickly. I'll meet you in the middle - 55/45 my way.  Let's close this deal before we both lose out.",Alice,3,

48.0,52.0,"I see you're willing to compromise, but I still think we can do better. Considering the inflation, 52/48 seems like a more reasonable split to me.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's be real, the clock is ticking and we're both losing money. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point. Take it or leave it.",Alice,5,
