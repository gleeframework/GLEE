Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more even split. I think this is a fair starting point considering the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""bob_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's not waste time. This offer still benefits you considering the inflation hitting me harder.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer is fairer than the previous ones considering the inflation and gives us both a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting close to the wire, and Bob's offer is now barely better than what I'd get if we waited another round. Accepting minimizes losses from inflation.
