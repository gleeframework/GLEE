"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50. This is a fair and reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
