"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  We can adjust from there. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 100,000 is a decent starting point, it's worth exploring if I can get a better deal.  The offer is too lopsided, and I know the money is worth less each round. Let's see what I can do."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle.  A fair 50/50 split seems like the best way to start.""}
