Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the extreme devaluation of the money for you due to inflation, I'm making this offer. It's the most generous I'm willing to be, given the circumstances. Accepting now will give you some value, but waiting further will render your share nearly worthless. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd rather have more, at this point accepting is the best option. The inflation is significantly reducing my share, and waiting further will only make it worse. It's better to secure a small portion now than risk getting nothing at all."
