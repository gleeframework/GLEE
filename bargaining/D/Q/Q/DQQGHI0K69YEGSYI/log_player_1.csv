"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more since I'm starting""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I'm framing it as a fair split, but with a slight bias towards my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering we both want to get the most we can out of this. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not too thrilled about the 55/45 split, and I think I can do better. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split, it's a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a more equal distribution of the money. I'm framing it as a compromise, hoping Bob will accept it."
