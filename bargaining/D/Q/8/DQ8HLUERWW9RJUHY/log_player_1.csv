"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to start.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, to see if he'll accept and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not settling for less than half, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll consider the offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a fair split, I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the risks.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is a bit less than his previous offer, but I'm trying to position myself for a better outcome in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up any more ground 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation affecting Bob's gain, I think he's getting desperate. I'll consider his offer carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's a 50/50 split, and considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I think it's the best I can get at this point."
