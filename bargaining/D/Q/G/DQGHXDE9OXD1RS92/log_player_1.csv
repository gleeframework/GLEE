Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60% and you get 40%""

Your turn, Bob!"

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's try to compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still consider the same values as before.

However, I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal, as it's not much different from the first round. I'd like to negotiate further.
