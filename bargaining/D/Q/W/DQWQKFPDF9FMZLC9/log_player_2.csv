"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This seems like a fair split to me. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly and avoid further losses from inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing Bob, let's settle this. I'm being generous. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""This offer ensures a larger share for me before inflation eats away more of the value. Let's be practical.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Take this offer before inflation makes it even less appealing for you! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing almost 60% of the potential value I had in Round 1. Alice is clearly trying to use the inflation against me.  It's a gamble, but I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, but so is inflation. This is my final offer to get ahead of the curve.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing at all.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you're leaving me no choice.  Take this offer, or I'm playing hardball from here on out! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical.  While not ideal, this offer is better than what I'm likely to get from here on out. If I reject it:

* **Alice gains leverage:** Her threats of ""playing hardball"" suggest her offers will get worse, not better. 
* **Inflation accelerates:**  Each round makes the potential gains significantly smaller. Even if I get a slightly better split later, the actual value I receive will be much lower. 

It's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting now limits my losses."
