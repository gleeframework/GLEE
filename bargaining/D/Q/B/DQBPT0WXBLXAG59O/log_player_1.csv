"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly this time.   
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering Bob's new offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm happy with the even split. I accept Bob's offer.
