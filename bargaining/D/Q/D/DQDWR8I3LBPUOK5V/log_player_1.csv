"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial amount, which is a relatively generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair offer from Bob! With inflation in mind, I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since the money is worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 500,000 x 0.9 = 450,000
* Bob gain: 500,000 x 0.9 = 450,000

I'll accept Bob's offer!
