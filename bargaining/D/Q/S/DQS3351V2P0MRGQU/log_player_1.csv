"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise too. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is the best I can get, but it's a good compromise. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
