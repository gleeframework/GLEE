"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a better deal. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me, my gain of 50 is actually equivalent to 50 / 0.95 = 52.63 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, considering I could have gotten 60 in the first round. But Bob's message suggests he's willing to compromise, so I'll consider this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
