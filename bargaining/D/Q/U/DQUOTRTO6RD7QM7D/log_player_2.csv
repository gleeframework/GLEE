Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm not playing your game anymore. This is my final offer, and it's more generous than I'm willing to be. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, it's clear Alice is playing a very aggressive strategy and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better. Accepting $1,000 is much better than risking getting zero in a future round where Alice might offer even less."
