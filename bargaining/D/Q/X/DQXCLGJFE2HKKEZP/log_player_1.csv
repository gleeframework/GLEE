"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60%""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I've included a message to try to persuade Bob that this is a fair split. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable. This offer still gives you a good share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less now, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Come on, Bob! It's getting less valuable by the minute! Let's settle on this.""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more generous offer this time, hoping that Bob will realize the decreasing value of the money and decide to accept. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  Anything else is just delaying the inevitable. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think accepting the 50/50 split is the best option at this point. We've lost almost half the value of the money, and continuing the game might lead to further losses. Time to settle!"
