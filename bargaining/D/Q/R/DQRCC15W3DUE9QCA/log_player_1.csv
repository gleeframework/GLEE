"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to split the money more evenly this time, with a slightly larger share for you, since you took the bigger share last round.  Let's see if we can reach a more balanced agreement. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
