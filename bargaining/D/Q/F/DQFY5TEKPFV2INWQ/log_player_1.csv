"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the inflation penalty!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! I'll have to think carefully about this one. Considering the inflation, I'd rather take a slightly lower amount now than risk waiting for another round and losing even more value.

I accept the offer.
