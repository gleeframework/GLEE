"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  This offer gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm hoping to secure a larger share.  The inflation works against Alice more, so I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split.  This offer takes into account the inflation rates, but still gives us both a significant portion.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is a better offer than your last, and time is working against both of us.   
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to become a real threat. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and Alice is getting a decent share as well."
