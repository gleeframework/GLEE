"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is a factor, Bob, but a 55/45 split in my favor seems more reasonable considering my gains are worth less than yours after two rounds. Let's compromise. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation and the impact of inflation on both players.
Given that we are in Round 4, the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round due to inflation, and for Alice, it's worth 9.75% less. This means that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases more significantly for me than for Alice.

### Step 2: Consider the previous offers and the reasoning behind them.
Alice initially proposed a 60/40 split in her favor, which I rejected. Then, I proposed a 55/45 split in my favor, considering the inflation impact, which Alice rejected. In Round 3, Alice proposed a 55/45 split in her favor, arguing that her gains are worth less than mine after two rounds, which I also rejected.

### Step 3: Calculate the actual value of the money for both players in the current round.
For me (Bob), the money is worth 64% of its original value (100% - 36% = 64%). For Alice, the money is worth 90.25% of its original value (100% - 9.75% = 90.25%).

### Step 4: Determine a fair proposal considering the inflation impact.
Given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, I should propose a split that accounts for this disparity. Aiming for a slightly more favorable split than the last offer I made, while still being mindful of Alice's perspective, seems reasonable.

### Step 5: Formulate the proposal and message.
Considering the above steps, I propose a 58/42 split in my favor. This adjustment reflects the increasing pressure of inflation on my potential gains while still acknowledging Alice's position and the need for compromise.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation on my end, I propose this split as a compromise, hoping we can finalize the agreement before the value decreases further for both of us.""}"
