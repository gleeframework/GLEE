"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can always negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to respond! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll get:

Alice gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500
Bob gain: 4000 / 0.95 = 4210.53

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I'm giving up a significant amount. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too low for me, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me again, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll get:

Alice gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500
Bob gain: 4000 / 0.95 = 4210.53

I'll try to do better than that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm still looking for a fair deal. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

This way, I'll get a bit more, but still leave some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to my target. I think this is a fair split. Your turn to respond! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is hitting hard! Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll get:

Alice gain: 5000 / 0.5248 = 9538.46

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, as I'll be giving up a significant amount. However, since Bob is proposing a 50/50 split, I'll consider it a fair deal. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I think this is a fair split. Let's shake on it!""
}
```"
