"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's make a fair deal!""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to receive $550,000, while Bob receives $450,000. The message ""Let's make a fair deal!"" aims to convey a sense of fairness and cooperation, encouraging Bob to accept the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the money will depreciate for me in future rounds. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round, considering the money is worth the same to me but will depreciate further for Bob. I'll try to negotiate for a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Consider the depreciation, this is a good deal for you.""}\n\nIn this offer, I propose to receive $580,000, while Bob receives $420,000. Given that the money depreciates by 5% for Bob in each round, I'm trying to persuade him that accepting this offer now would be in his best interest, as the value of the money will continue to decrease for him in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. The money is losing value rapidly, and I need to secure a decent amount for myself. 
# Alice gain: 487500 
# Bob gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the money depreciating significantly for Bob, his offer does not improve significantly enough from the previous round to justify accepting it. Given that the money's value remains constant for me, I believe I can continue to negotiate for a better share in the next round, as Bob's urgency to secure a deal due to the depreciating value of the money for him might lead to a more favorable offer for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""The depreciation is really hurting you, it's time to settle.""}\n\nIn this offer, I propose to receive $600,000, while Bob receives $400,000. I'm emphasizing the significant depreciation of the money's value for Bob, which is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and will continue to decrease. By highlighting this, I'm attempting to persuade Bob that accepting this offer is the best course of action, as further rounds will only result in him losing even more value."
