"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll consider the actual values.

For Round 2, the actual values are:

* Alice's gain: 100,000 * 0.9 = 90,000
* Bob's gain: 900,000 * 0.8 = 720,000

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal.
