650000.0,350000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be a little more realistic. We both know inflation is hitting us hard. A 65/35 split is fair, considering our losses. Let's wrap this up.",Alice,3,

420000.0,580000.0,"Alice, let's recalculate the split based on our current losses. I've taken into account the 36% decrease in my gains and the 19% decrease in yours. This 58/42 split should be more reasonable, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's end this game before our gains dwindle further.",Bob,4,
