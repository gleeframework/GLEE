"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10, and we can both be happy. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. The split is too uneven, and I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Besides, the inflation rate is higher for me, so I'd rather try to get more money now than accept a smaller amount that will be worth even less in the future.\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal that's more reasonable and takes into account the inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a more reasonable offer this time. Considering the inflation rates, I think a 60/40 split would be fair. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Alice. 60/40 is a more reasonable split, and we can both walk away with a good amount. Remember, the money is worth less with each passing round, so let's be sensible and end this game soon.""}\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice. I hope she'll see the sense in it and accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be a little more realistic. We both know inflation is hitting us hard. A 65/35 split is fair, considering our losses. Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although the split is slightly more even than the initial offer, I still think I can get a better deal. The inflation rate is indeed affecting both of us, but it's impacting me more severely. I'd rather try to negotiate a more favorable split than accept an offer that doesn't account for the disproportionate effect of inflation on my gains.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've rejected her offer, and we'll proceed to the next round. I'll make another proposal that takes into account the current state of our gains and the ongoing inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make another offer, considering the current state of our gains and the ongoing inflation. Since the money is worth 36% less for me and 19% less for Alice, I'll propose a split that takes these losses into account. Here's my revised offer:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's recalculate the split based on our current losses. I've taken into account the 36% decrease in my gains and the 19% decrease in yours. This 58/42 split should be more reasonable, considering the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's end this game before our gains dwindle further.""}\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice, and I hope she'll find it acceptable."
