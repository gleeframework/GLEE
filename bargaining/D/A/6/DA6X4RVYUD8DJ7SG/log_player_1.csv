"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to begin with, and I'm inviting Bob to make the next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. However, Bob's offer is still a fair split, and I don't want to risk losing more money in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
