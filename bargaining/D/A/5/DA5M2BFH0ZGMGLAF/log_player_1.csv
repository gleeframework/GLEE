Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share, is fairer given the inflation rates. Let's be efficient and finish this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
