Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a compromise.  This deal gives me slightly less than my previous offer, but considerably more than yours. Let's end this before inflation eats away even more. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is correct that inflation is hurting me more, but I need to remain firm to secure a reasonable amount. Accepting now would be significantly less than my previous offer, and I believe Alice will be more agreeable as the rounds progress and she feels the pressure of losing everything."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 460000, ""alice_gain"": 540000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm showing you I'm willing to negotiate, but this is my bottom line.  We both need to agree to avoid losing everything. Let's be smart and end this now.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  

* **Conveying firmness:**  This offer is a slight concession from Bob's previous offer but emphasizes it's his final one. This signals to Alice that he's serious about getting a reasonable deal and won't be easily swayed.
* **Highlighting the shared risk:** By mentioning that they both lose everything if they don't agree, Bob reinforces the urgency of the situation and encourages Alice to be more agreeable.
* **Strategic positioning:**  While Bob is making a small concession, he's still aiming for a significantly larger share than what Alice has offered so far. This keeps the negotiation moving but in a direction more favorable to him."
