"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair starting offer. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, I get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 10%. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm hoping for more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 6000 / 0.9 (10% less than the original 9000) = 6666.67
* Bob's gain: 4000 / 0.95 (5% less than the original 4200) = 4210.53

I'll reject this offer since I can do better. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I'm hoping for more. Let's keep negotiating!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 6666.67 / 0.9 (10% less than the previous round) = 7400
* Bob's gain: 4210.53 / 0.95 (5% less than the previous round) = 4441.13

My new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective amounts considering the inflation:

* My gain: 7400 / 0.727 (27.1% less than the original 9000) = 1017.85
* Bob's gain: 4441.13 / 0.858 (14.26% less than the original 4200) = 5173.53

Since my gain in this round is significantly less than the original 5000, I'll reject the offer. My message to Bob is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with such a low amount. I was hoping for more.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 1017.85 / 0.727 (27.1% less than the previous round) = 1400
* Bob's gain: 5173.53 / 0.858 (14.26% less than the previous round) = 6015.19

My new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if we can find a compromise.""
}
