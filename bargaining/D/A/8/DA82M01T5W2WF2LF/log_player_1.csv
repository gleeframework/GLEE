"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000$ and Bob getting 400,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a quarter, but I want the majority 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

The 250,000$ I would gain is now worth 80% of the original amount, which is 200,000$. The 750,000$ Bob would gain is now worth 90% of the original amount, which is 675,000$.

Considering the reduced values, I'll decide to reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 42-58""

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation.
