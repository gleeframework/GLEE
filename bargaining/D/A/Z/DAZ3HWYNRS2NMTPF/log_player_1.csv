"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take almost everything, leaving just $1 for Bob. Since the money inflates for Bob, he'll get less than $1 in the next round. This is a risky move, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value of taking something now rather than risking getting nothing at all in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round.  Bob's offer is fair considering the inflation."
