{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000/100,000 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates.  Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
