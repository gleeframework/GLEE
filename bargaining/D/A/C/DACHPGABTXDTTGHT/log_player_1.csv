"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can shake on it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering a smaller share for me, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer now against the potential gains I might get in future rounds.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer just yet. I'll wait for a better proposal or try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again! With inflation taking a 20% bite out of the money, my offer will be a bit more aggressive to account for the reduced value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more considering the initial 50-50 proposal.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking its toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. However, I'm not convinced that this offer is the best I can get, especially since Bob is still offering a slightly larger share to himself.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll keep waiting for a better offer, hoping that Bob will come back with something more favorable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","It's my turn again! With inflation taking a significant bite out of the money, my offer will be even more aggressive to account for the reduced value.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance now. I think this is the best I can do, considering the value of the money is dwindling.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will finally accept this offer!"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to accept a 50-50 split, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money. Let's end this negotiation and move forward. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The irony! Bob is now offering a 50-50 split, which is the same as my initial offer, but with a much lower value due to inflation.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, I also don't want to risk going to another round and potentially losing even more value.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take the 50-50 split. It's not the best I could have gotten, but it's better than risking further losses due to inflation."
