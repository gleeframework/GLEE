"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $10,000, which is $6,000, and leaving Bob with 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, no need to fight 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $4,000 I was initially offering Bob is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $3,600.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to meet in the middle, I'll try to counter that by offering a slightly more favorable split. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet in the middle, but with a slight edge for me""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the $10,000, which is $5,500, and leaving Bob with 45%, which is $4,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You had a slight edge last round, now it's my turn 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $4,000 I was initially offering Bob is still worth the same, but the $6,000 Bob is offering me is now worth 72.9% of its original value, which is $4,364.40.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was to give me a smaller share, I'll try to counter that by offering a more even split. However, I'll also try to get a slightly larger share for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Even split, but with a slight bias towards me""
}
```

I'm offering to take 57% of the $10,000, which is $5,700, and leaving Bob with 43%, which is $4,300."

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, now it's time to take control 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the $4,000 I was initially offering Bob is still worth the same, but the $7,000 Bob is offering me is now worth 59.05% of its original value, which is $5,907.50.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I'm getting a relatively small share, but it's still a significant amount. I'll accept this offer, as it's a decent compromise.
