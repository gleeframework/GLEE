"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $6000 and leave $4000 for Bob. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is an attempt to persuade Bob that the offer is reasonable and that he should accept it to avoid further rounds, which would decrease the value of the money for Alice but not for him.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, given that we're both losing some value each round. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I want to try to maximize my gain before the value decreases further.\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of my rejection."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's compromise and end this before it gets worse for me""}\n\nIn this offer, I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer from the previous round. Since the money is worth 20% less for me in each round, I'm willing to compromise to end the game sooner rather than later. I'm hoping Bob will see the reason in my offer and accept it to avoid further negotiations.\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response."
