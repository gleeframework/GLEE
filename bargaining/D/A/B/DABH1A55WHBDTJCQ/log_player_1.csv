"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering your decreasing valuation, this offer seems more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. By rejecting, I gamble on him offering more in the next round to avoid the money being worth even less to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Bob. This is a good deal before inflation hurts us both.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my demand slightly from the initial offer, as the pressure is now on Bob.  He knows I'll value the money even less in the next round. This offer is still generous to him, but also ensures I'm not losing out too much due to the decreasing value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the impact of inflation, this division seems more equitable now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision point. While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice now for a few reasons:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (almost 30% less than round 1). 
* **Downward Trend:**  Bob's offer has gotten progressively worse, indicating he's likely to continue lowballing me.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk of getting even less in the next round. While accepting means getting a smaller share, it's better than potentially getting a much smaller amount, or even nothing if the game continues."
