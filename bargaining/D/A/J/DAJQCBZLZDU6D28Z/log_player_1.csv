I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I think this is a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm going to offer to take $8,100 and give Bob $1,900.  While I lost some money due to inflation, I'm still willing to give Bob a decent share. This should hopefully encourage him to accept the offer before the inflation gets even worse."
