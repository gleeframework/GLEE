"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money with a 70/30 split in my favor. This seems fair considering the potential inflation over time. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's risky to accept without knowing how the inflation affects her.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counter-offer and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fairer distribution considering we both have equal chance of benefiting from inflation.""
