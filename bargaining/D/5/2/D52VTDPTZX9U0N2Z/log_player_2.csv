"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems fair on the surface, the inflation heavily favors me in later rounds. Alice is losing value far quicker than I am. It's in my best interest to wait for a better offer, even if it means a slightly smaller amount later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, but that split isn't favorable for me in the long run.  How about this slightly adjusted offer?""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Appear Reasonable:**  Starting with a counter-offer that's closer to Alice's initial proposal makes me seem more reasonable and willing to negotiate.
* **Time Advantage:**  I need to acknowledge that while the initial offer was bad for me long-term, Alice is still losing value faster.  A slightly better offer might entice her to close the deal now.
* **Future Leverage:** By offering a 45/55 split, I'm setting myself up for a potentially better deal in later rounds. If Alice rejects this, I can reasonably expect to push for a higher percentage in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle of our previous offers, 58-42 is a reasonable compromise 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate. Her offer is only slightly better for me, and the devaluation is significantly impacting her potential gains. This suggests I have the upper hand and can push for a much more favorable outcome in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it while it's still a good deal for you.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  Alice's increasingly desperate offers indicate she's feeling the pressure of the devaluation. I'm now in a strong position to push for a more favorable outcome.
* **50/50 as Leverage:** Offering an even split seems fair on the surface and can be persuasive. It allows me to frame the offer as generous while still being advantageous in the long run.
* **Urgency:** By emphasizing the diminishing value, I can hopefully push Alice to accept this offer before she loses even more potential gain."
