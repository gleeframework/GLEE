"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair at this point in the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I need to consider the value of the money. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. My goal is to maximize my gain while considering the inflation factor.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With Bob's previous offer in mind, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a slightly higher share.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting Bob's gain significantly now! With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, I need to be cautious. However, this offer is quite generous from Bob's perspective, considering the reduced value of his gain.

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the inflation is making Bob's gain worth less and less, I might consider accepting this offer to avoid further rounds.
