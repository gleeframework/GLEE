Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time, Bob.  Inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal later. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I'll accept the offer since the money is worth less to me with each passing round, and getting 50 now is better than risking a worse deal later."
