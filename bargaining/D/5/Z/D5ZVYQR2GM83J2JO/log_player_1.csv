"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You get a smaller share, but it's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more after rejecting your 60-40 offer. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure I like the way Bob is trying to negotiate after rejecting my initial offer. However, I'll consider his new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer because I think he's trying to take advantage of me by offering a smaller share after I already made a generous initial offer. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's even more generous than my initial one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm not going to give in completely. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 55-45 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial 60-40 offer. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to accept your offer. I think I deserve more considering the current value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get an even better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I reject Bob's offer because, although the money is worth less due to inflation, I still think his offer is too skewed in his favor. I'll wait for his next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the inflation and the fact that Bob is getting more aggressive with his proposals.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to let you take advantage of the inflation. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 48-52 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offers, but still reasonable considering the current value of the money. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
