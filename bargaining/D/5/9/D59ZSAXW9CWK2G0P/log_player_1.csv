"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to divide the $10,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $5,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $4,000, especially when I think I'm worth more than that. I'll try to make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I think I'm worth the extra 500""}

I'm increasing my offer to $5,500, which is still a decent compromise, considering the inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting! Bob is trying to meet me halfway, and I think this is a decent compromise.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise. I think we've both made some good moves, and this is a good place to stop. Let's finalize the deal!"
