"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 60/40, I'll try to counter with a similar ratio, but with a slight bias towards me. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effect of inflation, my offer in round 2 was actually quite generous. Alice's offer now seems more reasonable. I'll accept this offer.
