"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both agree on this.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 60 dollars and Bob gets 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering your offer in the previous round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the 40-60 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 40-60, I'll try to negotiate a better split. I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, I think we can both get a fair share this way.""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will consider it a more reasonable offer."
