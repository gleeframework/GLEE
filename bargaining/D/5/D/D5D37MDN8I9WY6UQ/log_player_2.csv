Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's be real. The clock is ticking, and your share is shrinking fast.  64/36 is generous considering. Deal? 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is trying to pressure me, but that offer is far too low.  I need to hold out for a better split."

{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""The deal is getting worse for both of us, Alice.  I'm still willing to split more than half with you, but let's be reasonable and close this out.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my guns on this. Take the 33% now, or risk getting even less in the next round. It's your call. 
# Bob gain: 3300 
# Alice gain: 6700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting ridiculous. I need to hold strong, even though the pressure is on. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation to her advantage, but I'm not going to accept a deal this lopsided."
