900000.0,100000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get the remaining 10%. We can negotiate further if you want.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your offer is quite cheeky! Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects that I lose value over time in this game, while you do not.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"I understand your point about the inflation, but I'm still willing to compromise. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This gives you a bigger share than the last round, and we can avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. I need a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Let's meet in the middle â€“ 55% for me, 45% for you. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, we're both losing money with every round. I'm willing to give you a larger share than before, but we need to compromise. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. This ensures we both get a significant amount and can avoid further losses.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
480000.0,520000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing a significant chunk of money with every passing round due to the inflation. My offer is 52% for me and 48% for you.  Take this deal before the inflation eats up even more of the pie.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Bob, we're both losing value here. I'm trying to be fair, but we need to reach an agreement soon.  How about a 55/45 split in my favor? This is a decent compromise considering the inflation, and we can avoid further losses.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is my final offer. A straight 50/50 split.  It's clear you're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I won't accept anything less than an equal share. Let's end this now before we both lose out.",Bob,8,
