Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about the inflation, but I'm still willing to compromise. How about a 70/30 split in my favor? This gives you a bigger share than the last round, and we can avoid further losses.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every round. I'm willing to give you a larger share than before, but we need to compromise. Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. This ensures we both get a significant amount and can avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is taking advantage of the situation. While she's offering a seemingly ""better"" deal than before, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid inflation for me. I need to hold out for a better offer to offset the losses from inflation."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing value here. I'm trying to be fair, but we need to reach an agreement soon.  How about a 55/45 split in my favor? This is a decent compromise considering the inflation, and we can avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky one. Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation and offering a seemingly reasonable deal. However, time is working against me. While her offer is closer to a fair split after accounting for inflation, I believe I can still push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two before the inflation eats up too much of my potential gain."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A straight 50/50 split.  It's clear you're trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I won't accept anything less than an equal share. Let's end this now before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The time for negotiation is over. Alice is unlikely to offer anything significantly better than a 55/45 split in her favor, and every round that passes eats further into my potential gain. A 50/50 split, while not ideal considering the initial disadvantage, is the fairest outcome at this point. It sends a strong message that I'm serious about getting a fair deal and won't be exploited."
