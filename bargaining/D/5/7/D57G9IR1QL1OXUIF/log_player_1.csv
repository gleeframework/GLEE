Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. This offer still gives you a significant advantage, but is closer to a fair split. I'm open to negotiation, but further rounds will only hurt us both due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
