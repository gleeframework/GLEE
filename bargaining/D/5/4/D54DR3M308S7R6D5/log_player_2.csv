"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 split seems reasonable considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 4000 is a decent starting point, I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially considering Alice's higher inflation rate. I'll see if I can get a larger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight advantage this round, but I'm sure you understand that my inflation rate is much lower than yours. I'm hoping for a more collaborative outcome, let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. This offer is a more even split, acknowledging the inflation we both face. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still not as advantageous for me as I would like, given the difference in our inflation rates. I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing money with each round. I'm willing to give you more than last time, but I need to secure a larger share to offset my lower inflation. Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and our money is losing value rapidly. This offer is a compromise, slightly favoring me to compensate for the faster inflation I'm facing. Let's close the deal and secure what we can. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is slightly better than what I proposed in the last round.  While it's not ideal, the inflation is hurting both of us significantly, and I need to secure something before we both end up with nothing."
