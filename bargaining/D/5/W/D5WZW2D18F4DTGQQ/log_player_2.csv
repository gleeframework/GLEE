Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You didn't take my first offer, I'll be a bit more generous than last time, but not too much. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and end this.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell. I'll give you a tiny bit more, but I'm not going to split it evenly. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best option for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Due to inflation, the value of Bob's potential gain is decreasing each round. 
* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has consistently offered deals favoring herself, and her messages suggest she's willing to drag this out.
* **Future Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better than 43 in subsequent rounds. 

While 43 is less than the previous offers, it's better to secure something now rather than risk getting even less later due to inflation."
