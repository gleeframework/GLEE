"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  It's a good starting point, wouldn't you agree?

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. 60/40 in my favor. It's a fair deal considering the inflation. Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable split, the impact of inflation is significant. Accepting this offer would give me $4000, which is now worth considerably less than it was in Round 1. It's still better to hold out for a better deal in the hopes that Alice feels the pressure of the decreasing value."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Alright, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's a fair compromise given the inflation.  Let's make a deal and get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure and is now willing to accept the 55/45 split, but in her favor! This is unacceptable. While the value of the money is decreasing, it's decreasing much faster for Alice. I need to hold firm and make it clear that a deal where I receive less than half is not going to happen."
