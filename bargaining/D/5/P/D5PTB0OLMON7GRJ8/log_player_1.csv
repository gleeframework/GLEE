"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, Alice. How about we split it down the middle? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd rather take a bit more. However, splitting it down the middle is a reasonable offer, and I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer.
