Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 570000

This is a tough one! But with inflation eating into my potential gains, it's time to cut my losses. Accepting Alice's offer gives me 430,000 which is still significantly less than my initial goal, but further rounds carry the risk of even further losses for me."
