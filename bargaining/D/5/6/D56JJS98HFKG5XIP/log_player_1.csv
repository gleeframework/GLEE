"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest, considering inflation will affect me more with each round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob more with each round, a 50-50 split might be a good idea. However, I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to account for my initial offer being rejected, which means I'll have to be more cautious in this round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider a 50/50 split, but I'd like to make it 5100 for me and 4900 for you, considering the initial rejection.""
}
```

Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, and I rejected it, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. With inflation affecting Bob more and more, I'll aim to take a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're right that inflation will hit you harder, Bob, but I'm feeling bold. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll accept a slightly less favorable split this round to avoid further inflation losses. Let's call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more cautious with each round, and I'm not getting any younger. Considering the inflation is taking a bigger toll on Bob's potential earnings, I think this offer is a reasonable compromise.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, you've made a good point. Let's end this on a fair note. I accept your offer.""
}
```

I think I'll take the $6,000 and call it a day. Thanks for playing the game with me, Bob!"
