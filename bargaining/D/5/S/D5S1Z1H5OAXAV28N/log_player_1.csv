"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40. Is this a fair deal?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous. I'll take 60% and leave you with 40%.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. However, I'm not going to fall for it. My initial proposal was a 60-40 split, and I'm willing to stick to it. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll stick to my original proposal. Let's split the money 60-40.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll stick to my original proposal. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's stick to my original proposal. 60-40 split, no need to complicate things.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this time!"
