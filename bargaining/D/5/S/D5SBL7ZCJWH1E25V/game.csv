60.0,40.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to start.  This gives us both something and avoids the risk of getting nothing later.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I think a more equitable split is 55/45 in my favor.  This recognizes your initial offer but also accounts for the fact that we both lose money with each round. Let's work together to get something before the value drops too much.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but the split still needs to be more reasonable. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Time is running out, let's settle this before we both lose out.",Alice,3,
