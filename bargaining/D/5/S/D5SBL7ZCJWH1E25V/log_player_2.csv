Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor to start.  This gives us both something and avoids the risk of getting nothing later.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think a more equitable split is 55/45 in my favor.  This recognizes your initial offer but also accounts for the fact that we both lose money with each round. Let's work together to get something before the value drops too much.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but the split still needs to be more reasonable. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  Time is running out, let's settle this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
