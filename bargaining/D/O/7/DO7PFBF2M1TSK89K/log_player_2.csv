"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my share remains the same value, but your share is decreasing in value. This offer is more generous than it seems. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

# Alice's message: The value of your share keeps decreasing due to inflation. I'm being more than fair with this offer. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is taking advantage of my diminishing returns. While she's right that my potential gains are decreasing, her offer doesn't reflect a fair compromise. I need to hold firm and hope she becomes more agreeable as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  This is a 50/50 split. It's the fairest offer considering the circumstances. Take it or leave it.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said 50/50 is fair, but the value of your share has decreased significantly. This offer takes that into account. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is blatantly trying to wear me down. She knows time is on her side, but I proposed a 50/50 split in round 6, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. Accepting this offer would be letting her take advantage of the situation. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal, even if it means going down to the wire."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. I'm willing to compromise slightly from the 50/50 split to reach an agreement.  Let's end this now and avoid losing everything.""}"

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You've made your final offer, but I'm still willing to negotiate. This is a slightly better deal for you, considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  Time is running out, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate down to the wire.  While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than anything she's offered before and significantly better than risking getting nothing in the final rounds. It's a tough decision, but it's time to cut my losses and secure something rather than risk everything."
