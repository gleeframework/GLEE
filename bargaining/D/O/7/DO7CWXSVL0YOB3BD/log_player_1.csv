"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to offer a split that gives me a larger share, but still leaves Bob with something.  I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept, avoiding any risk of losing money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to accept this offer than risk losing more money due to inflation.  This at least gives me some money, and I'm not sure if Bob will offer me anything more in the future."
