"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to try and secure the vast majority of the money in the first round.  This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  If Bob accepts, great!  If not, I'll have to adjust my strategy for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, I'm taking the 500,000. It's better than getting nothing."
