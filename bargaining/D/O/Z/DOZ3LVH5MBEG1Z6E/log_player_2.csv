"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, the total amount is $8,000.

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:
$8,000 (initial amount) * 0.64 (80% of 100% - 20% inflation) = $5,120 (my gain)
$10,000 (initial amount) = $10,000 (Alice's gain)

Alice's offer is:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 

I'll accept this offer since it's a better deal than what I initially proposed.
