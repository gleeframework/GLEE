# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives Alice a significantly larger share, and I believe I can negotiate for a more favorable division. Let's proceed to the next round."

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation affects me, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This is my counter-offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although Alice is affected by inflation, her proposed division still doesn't seem balanced enough, considering the impact of inflation on her share is increasing. I'll wait for a better opportunity in the next rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact on your share, I'm willing to take a bit more, but still leaving you with a substantial amount.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close to a point where the deal won't be worth it for me. This is my final offer for a significant amount. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Despite Alice's warning that we're getting close to a point where the deal won't be worth it for her, her proposed division still gives her a larger share. Given the significant impact of inflation on her share, which is now worth 34.39% less than in the first round, I believe I can negotiate for an even better deal in the next rounds. The pressure of the game ending with no deal for either of us might prompt Alice to offer or accept a more favorable division for me."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Considering the substantial impact of inflation on your share, I believe this division is more reasonable. It's getting late in the game, and we both risk losing everything if we don't reach an agreement soon.""}"
