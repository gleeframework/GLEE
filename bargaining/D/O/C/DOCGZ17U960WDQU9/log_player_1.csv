Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the substantial impact of inflation on your share, I believe this division is more reasonable. It's getting late in the game, and we both risk losing everything if we don't reach an agreement soon. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

The inflation is really starting to hurt, and waiting any longer is too risky. Bob has steadily increased his offer, and while I'd prefer a larger share, getting something is better than nothing.
