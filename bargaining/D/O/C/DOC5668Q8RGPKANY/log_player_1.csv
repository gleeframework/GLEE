Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  While the money will be worth less in future rounds, this offer is still fair considering I'm taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
