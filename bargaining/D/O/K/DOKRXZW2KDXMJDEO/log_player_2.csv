``` 
I'm Bob and I want to maximize my gains.  This offer is terrible, and I have 12 rounds to try and get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I'm going to take a bold step here and offer Alice a small portion, hoping she'll be more willing to negotiate in the future.  I'm confident I can get a better deal if she rejects this."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is much better than her first one, I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get closer to an even split. I have to factor in the inflation, but I believe I can get a better deal eventually."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still aiming for a larger share. I want to see if Alice is willing to compromise a bit more, recognizing that the value of the money is decreasing with each passing round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much better deal for me than her previous offers, considering the inflation. While I would prefer a bit more, getting an equal share is a good outcome. I'm accepting!"
