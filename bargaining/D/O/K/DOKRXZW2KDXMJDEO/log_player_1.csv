"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for a large portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept a smaller amount to get something in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a clear reversal of my previous one. While the inflation is hurting me more, I still believe I can secure a better deal. I will reject and try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to reduce my initial demand but still aim for a significant portion of the money. I've factored in the inflation impact and think this offer is a reasonable compromise. Bob might be more willing to accept as we are getting closer to the middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, but the inflation is really hurting me now. While I'm tempted to accept, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject and hope for a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Given the escalating inflation and Bob's stubbornness, I'm now proposing a 50/50 split. This is the fairest option considering the current circumstances. I hope Bob realizes that continuing to reject offers will only lead to a situation where we both lose more money."
