"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm sure you can understand why I want the larger share.  Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

 I'm going to take a chance and see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the money will lose value with each round. Let's end this quickly and both get a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a significant share to make it worthwhile.  Let's wrap this up before the value drops further. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more,  I don't want to risk getting nothing.  The inflation is a real concern, and Alice seems unwilling to budge much.  It's better to take what I can get at this point."
