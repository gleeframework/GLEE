"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split.  Let's get this over with quickly! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this game, it's clear that Alice's offer is far from a ""fair split"" as she claims, with her gaining 9 times more than me. Given that we have 12 rounds and the money's value decreases with each round, especially more significantly for me (20% less each round), there's an incentive to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, accepting such an uneven split without attempting to negotiate would be premature. I should reject this offer and propose a more equitable division in the next round, hoping that the threat of further devaluation will encourage Alice to accept a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nGiven that we both lose value with each passing round, but I lose more value than Alice, it's in my interest to try and reach an agreement sooner rather than later. However, I also need to ensure the split is somewhat fair. Considering the first offer was heavily skewed in Alice's favor, my counteroffer should aim for a more equitable split but still acknowledge the pressure of devaluing money.

Offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle before it's too late!""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer gives Alice a larger share, recognizing her initial stance, but also significantly increases my share to make it more balanced. The message emphasizes the urgency due to devaluation, encouraging Alice to consider the offer seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get more than 5500 to make this worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nGiven the current state of the game and the impact of inflation on both our potential gains, it's crucial to reassess the situation. Alice's offer now gives me 4000, which is less than my previous proposal but still a significant improvement over her initial offer. Considering the money's devaluation, 4000 now is worth less than it would have been initially, but the difference between our shares is not as drastic as in the first round.

However, it's also important to consider the remaining rounds and the potential for further negotiation. Accepting this offer means securing a known quantity now, albeit devalued, versus risking further devaluation in pursuit of a potentially better split that may never materialize.

Given these considerations and the pressure of inflation, accepting Alice's current offer might be the most pragmatic decision to ensure I receive a substantial amount before the money's value decreases further.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nThis choice prioritizes securing a known amount now over the uncertainty of future negotiations, factoring in the significant impact of inflation on potential future gains."
