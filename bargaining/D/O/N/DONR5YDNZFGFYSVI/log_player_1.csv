"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40 and taking $60 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split. Since the value of money decreases with each round, I'm trying to find a balance between being generous enough for Bob to accept and ensuring I get a decent share. Given that the money devalues more significantly for Bob, I'm hoping he'll see the benefit in accepting this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the money's value decreases with each round, accepting $45, which is worth 10% less than in the first round, doesn't seem favorable to me. Given that Bob is more significantly impacted by inflation (20% devaluation), I believe he has more to lose from further rounds. Therefore, I'm choosing to proceed, hoping that in the next round, I can propose a division that is more advantageous to me or that the increasing pressure of inflation will make Bob more inclined to accept a future offer that might be less favorable to him than this current one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you than the last one I offered""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering Bob $42 and taking $58 for myself. Given the devaluation of money, my $58 is worth less than it would have been in the first round, but it's still a favorable split for me. For Bob, the $42 is worth significantly less due to the 20% devaluation he experiences each round. My message points out that, considering inflation, this offer is actually more advantageous for Bob than my initial proposal, as the difference in devaluation rates means he loses more value with each passing round. I'm hoping this logic, combined with the pressure of further potential losses, will encourage Bob to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair 50/50 split. Inflation is only getting worse, let's end this now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. At this point, the money I gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, and for Bob, it's worth 48.8% less. Given the significant impact of inflation, especially on Bob's share, I believe this offer is reasonable. The diminishing value of the money with each round means that continuing to negotiate could lead to both of us losing even more value. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a known quantity now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. The fact that Bob is willing to offer a 50/50 split at this stage suggests he is also aware of the increasing loss of value and is eager to conclude the game."
