"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob is interested in accepting and ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll consider the offer as:

* My gain: $4000 / 0.95 = $4210.53
* Bob's gain: $6000

Considering this, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and the fact that Bob's offer was slightly better than mine in the first round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm still making the proposal 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the inflation, the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, so I'll calculate my gain as:

* My gain: $3500 / 0.8587 (1 - 0.1413) = $4067.33

I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation and the fact that Bob's offers are getting progressively better. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```"
