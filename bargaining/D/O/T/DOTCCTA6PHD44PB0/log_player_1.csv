"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can avoid any potential disputes. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll give you a chance to get something 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, the actual values are:

Alice's gain: $3000
Bob's gain: $7000

I'm not thrilled about the large disparity, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer for now.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want a decent amount""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to be generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the actual values are:

Alice's gain: $4000
Bob's gain: $6000

I'm not impressed with the slight increase in my share, considering the large decrease in value due to inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a middle ground, meet me in the middle""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, hoping we can find a mutually acceptable deal. What do you think, Bob?"
