"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and let's split the million!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair deal considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't outdo me, let's see what you've got! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

I don't want to give up 600,000, but I also don't want to risk waiting for another round. Considering the inflation factor, I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
