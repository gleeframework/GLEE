Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours, but that's as low as I'll go 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a compromise, the deal is getting significantly worse for me with each round due to inflation.  I need to push for a more substantial gain in the next round, otherwise, the impact of inflation will make even an even split unfavorable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  Inflation is hurting my potential gain significantly. I'm proposing an even split. Take it or leave it.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is hurting your gain, but I've been consistent in my offers. Meet me at 56-44 or we'll keep playing 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm, and the effects of inflation are becoming increasingly detrimental. Accepting her offer of 4400 is significantly better than risking getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
