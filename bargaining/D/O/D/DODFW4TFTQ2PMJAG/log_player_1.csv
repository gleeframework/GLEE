# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

I'll think carefully about it... Considering the inflation, I'd rather not accept an offer that leaves me with 4000, as it's worth 5% less than the 5000 I initially proposed.

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal for myself.
