"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward division. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I want 60 for my efforts 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I'll consider the new values:

* Alice gain: 40 (worth 90% of the original $50, due to 10% inflation)
* Bob gain: 60 (worth 80% of the original $50, due to 20% inflation)

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll decide to reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the rejection, we move on to Round 3. Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still want a slight edge""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a slightly weighted division in my favor, with me getting 45% and Bob getting 55%. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm still open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

* Alice gain: 42 (worth 84% of the original $50, due to 16% inflation)
* Bob gain: 58 (worth 76% of the original $50, due to 24% inflation)

I'll think about this offer... Considering the inflation, the values are decreasing rapidly. I'll decide to accept this offer, as it seems like a decent compromise.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
