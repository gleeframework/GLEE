Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need to look out for myself too. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
