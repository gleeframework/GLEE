"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $4000 x 0.9 = $3600.

I'll reject Bob's offer since it's still not as good as my original 50/50 split. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight advantage, but I still want a decent share""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, offering Bob a smaller share, but still leaving some room for negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll compromise a bit more, but I'm still not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! Since the money is worth 27.1% less, my gain of $4800 is actually worth $4800 x 0.7279 = $3495.12.

I'll reject Bob's offer since it's still not as good as my previous offers, considering the reduced value of the money.

# Alice gain: 5100 
# Bob gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! Since the money is worth 40.95% less, my gain of $5100 is actually worth $5100 x 0.5915 = $3019.95.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to be more aggressive in this round, considering the extremely reduced value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking control, it's time to wrap up""

# Bob's message: I'll make one last push, let's see if we can find a compromise 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really crippling the value of the money! Since the money is worth 52.17% less, my gain of $5200 is actually worth $5200 x 0.4757 = $2473.64.

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's a relatively fair split, considering the extremely reduced value of the money. I don't want to risk going to another round and potentially getting an even worse deal.
