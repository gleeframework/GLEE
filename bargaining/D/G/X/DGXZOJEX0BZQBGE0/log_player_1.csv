Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair this time.  50/50 split seems like the best way to go.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more this time, but I need more than 4800 to make it worth it. Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the bigger share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate and the inflation is working significantly in my favor. He's willing to give me more than my last offer, but his perception of the value is skewed by the inflation. I'll hold out for a better deal as long as possible."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting impatient, Alice. We're both losing money here. Let's split it 53/47, with me taking slightly more this time.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation. Bob is getting closer to my previous offer, but he's framed it as his ""final offer,"" attempting to pressure me.  While he's losing value faster, getting nothing is a possibility for both of us.  However, I'm betting he's more desperate than he's letting on and will concede further in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Alright Bob, I appreciate you trying to negotiate. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.  You're losing money fast!""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

This is a high-risk, high-reward play. I'm pushing slightly above my previous offer,  calling it my ""final offer"" to mirror Bob's tactic. The goal is to pressure him into accepting before he realizes that waiting could potentially net him a tiny advantage (though risking it all). The substantial inflation working against him increases the chance he'll crack."
