Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""I think we should aim for a more balanced split. How about this?""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** Alice's initial offer was heavily skewed in her favor. While a 60/40 split might seem reasonable in some scenarios, the decreasing value of the money over time means we need to find a more balanced solution quickly.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases.  A slightly favorable offer now is better than risking a worse outcome later.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By making a counter-offer that is still somewhat generous to Alice, Bob shows a willingness to negotiate but establishes a stronger position for future rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Unfavorable:** While Alice's offer has moved slightly towards the middle ground, it's still a significantly better deal for her. Accepting now would mean settling for less than what Bob could potentially secure.
* **Time Pressure:** While we're only on round 3, the clock is ticking. However, it's not yet time to panic and accept an unfair deal. A firm rejection might push Alice to be more reasonable in the next round.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Bob's previous offer of a 5250/4750 split was reasonable and could be revisited.  Alice might be willing to accept it in a later round as the pressure increases."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5125,
""alice_gain"": 4875,
""message"": ""Time is running out, let's be practical. This is a fair deal that benefits us both.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** Bob is reducing his initial ask slightly (from 5250 to 5125) to show a willingness to compromise.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the shrinking pot of money. This encourages Alice to take a deal sooner rather than later.
* **Positioning for Later Rounds:**  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob is still in a strong position to make further small concessions in later rounds while keeping the split relatively balanced."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, let's compromise before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is moving in the right direction, but at a snail's pace.  Her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.
* **Inflation Impact:** The effect of inflation is becoming more significant. Accepting a 4300 gain now is a much worse deal than accepting even 4500 just two rounds ago. 
* **Calculated Risk:** We're getting closer to the halfway point of the game, but Bob is still in a good position to negotiate. Another rejection might push Alice to make a more substantial jump in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this before we both lose out.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:**  It's time for Bob to take a firm stance. By proposing a 50/50 split, he's clearly signaling that he won't accept anything less than an equal share. 
* **Ultimatum:**  The message frames this as a final offer. This puts the pressure on Alice to either accept a fair deal now or risk getting a worse outcome in later rounds.
* **Time Sensitivity:** With each passing round, the money is worth less. The longer this drags on, the more both players stand to lose. A 50/50 split is the cleanest and quickest way to end the game with a reasonable outcome for both sides."
