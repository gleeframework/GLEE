"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, it's now worth $9,000. I'll make a new offer.

{""bob_gain"": 8000, ""alice_gain"": 2000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 19% less after the second round, it's now worth $7,200. I'll consider Alice's offer.

Since the offer is 50/50, I'll accept it to avoid further rounds and the decreasing value of the money.
