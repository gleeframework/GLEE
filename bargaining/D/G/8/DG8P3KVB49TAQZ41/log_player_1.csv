Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit unbalanced. How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
