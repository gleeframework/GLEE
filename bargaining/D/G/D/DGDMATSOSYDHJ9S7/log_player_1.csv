"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering $6000 for myself and $4000 for Bob, considering that with each round, the money devalues more for Bob than for me. This division slightly favors me but compensates for the higher devaluation rate Bob faces. The message aims to convey a sense of fairness and urgency, encouraging Bob to accept early to avoid further loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly to avoid further inflation risks. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, although it seems fair at first glance (50/50 split), the impact of inflation is not evenly distributed between us. Given that the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob with each passing round, an even split does not equate to equal value gained by both parties over time. I aim to negotiate a split that accounts for this discrepancy, potentially leveraging the greater impact of inflation on Bob's share to secure a more favorable deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more balanced split.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer slightly from the first round, still favoring myself but acknowledging the need for a compromise that might entice Bob to accept. Given the inflation rates, the actual value we both receive diminishes with each round, but more so for Bob. This offer attempts to find a middle ground, slightly increasing Bob's share from my initial proposal while still recognizing the uneven impact of inflation on our gains. The message aims to convey a sense of reasonableness and the urgency of reaching an agreement before further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to reach a compromise. This offer takes into account the inflation, but also considers a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, despite Bob's attempt to frame it as a compromise, the proposed split of $4500 for me and $5500 for Bob does not adequately account for the disproportionate impact of inflation on our respective shares. At this point, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, and for Bob, it's worth 27.1% less than initially. Bob's offer does not sufficiently compensate for this disparity. Furthermore, accepting this would mean I'm agreeing to a deal where Bob receives more than half, despite the significantly higher devaluation of his share over time. I believe there's room for a more favorable negotiation that considers these dynamics."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Let's not forget, time is money, and inflation is biting us both.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more conciliatory offer compared to my previous ones, acknowledging the pressure of time and the shared impact of inflation, albeit uneven. By proposing $5600 for myself and $4400 for Bob, I'm trying to find a sweet spot that might be acceptable to Bob, considering the increasingly significant loss in value we both face with each passing round. The message is a reminder of the urgency and the mutual disadvantage of prolonging negotiations, aiming to nudge Bob towards accepting this offer."
