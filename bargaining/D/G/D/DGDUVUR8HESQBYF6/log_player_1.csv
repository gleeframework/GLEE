"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide...

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the ratio, and I think I can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no need for drama!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, a fair and equal division of the remaining $100."
