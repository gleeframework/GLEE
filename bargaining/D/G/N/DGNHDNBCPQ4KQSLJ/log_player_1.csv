"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 7:3, it's a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, giving me $700,000 and Bob $300,000. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can end the game quickly. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and simple proposal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal for a 50/50 split, I think it's a reasonable offer, especially since we're already in the second round and the money is worth less.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
