"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get a small share now, but it'll be worth more to you in future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less to me in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to get a better deal before the value decreases further. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I'd like a bit more than half.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm trying to negotiate a better deal, taking into account the fact that the money loses value for me with each passing round. I'm hoping Alice will consider the impact of inflation on my share and be willing to compromise."
