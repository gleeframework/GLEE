Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a larger share, but let's be fair. This offer ensures you still receive a significant portion while accounting for the impact of inflation on both of us. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000
