"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the original amount. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $200,000 is actually worth $180,000 now.

I think Bob's offer is a bit too generous, considering the inflation. I'd like to get a better share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the current value of the money.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is 30% of the current value of the money. I'm hoping this is more in line with what Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is the maximum I can offer given the current value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $291,400 now.

I'm still not satisfied with this offer, as I think I can get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

}
```
