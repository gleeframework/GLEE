I'm going for a large share, hoping Bob will accept in the first round to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $1000, the inflation effect means the value of that money will only decrease with each passing round.  I'm willing to gamble on getting a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm confident I can secure a majority of the money.  Bob is likely feeling the pressure of inflation now, and may be more inclined to accept a deal before the value of his share drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not happy with this offer, it's clear that Bob is feeling the sting of inflation more than I am.  The value of his share is significantly lower than it was in the first round.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible move at this point."
