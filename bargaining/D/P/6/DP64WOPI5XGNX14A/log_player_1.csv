"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more considering the risk of inflation. I'll give you a 80/20 split, but I'll take the majority. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
