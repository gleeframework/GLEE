"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be efficient, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll try to find a middle ground that benefits me more than Alice's initial offer.

{""bob_gain"": 420000,
""alice_gain"": 580000,
""message"": ""Let's find a better balance, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is money, Bob. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. Although the money is worth less with each passing round, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal considering the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's gain. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, I think this is a more suitable split.""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Let's end this before the inflation eats away at the gains. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, I believe this offer is reasonable. The difference in the amount of money we gain is now more pronounced due to the increasing inflation, but the actual value of the money is decreasing rapidly. At this point, it's better to accept the offer and secure a larger share rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
