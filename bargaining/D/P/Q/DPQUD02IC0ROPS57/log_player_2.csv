"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice frames it as a ""fair split,""  it's heavily skewed in her favor. It's better to take a risk in the hopes of getting a better offer in the next round, even with the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""That's not fair, Alice. How about we go 60/40?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. 50/50 is the fairest option given the current inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is now much better than her initial proposal, and with inflation eating into my potential gains, holding out for a significantly better deal is too risky. A 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome at this point."
