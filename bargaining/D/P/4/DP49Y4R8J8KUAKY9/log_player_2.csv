Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I think we can find a better compromise.  Let's try 45 for me, and 55 for you. This will give us both more than the previous round, and we'll still have time to work out a fairer deal if we need to. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid inflation working against her. It's worth holding out for a better deal, as each round makes a significant difference to her potential gains."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your point about the clock ticking, but I'm still not comfortable with such a large disparity.  Let's compromise a little. I'll take 40, you take 60.  This is a better deal for both of us than the previous offer, and it keeps the negotiation moving. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We are now past the halfway point of the rounds.  The longer the negotiation goes, the less valuable the money becomes, especially for Alice.
* **Favorable Split:** While not ideal, getting $60 is significantly better than risking getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement.  Alice's offer has steadily increased, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal (like the 65/35 split) carries a significant risk. There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better, and we risk ending up with nothing.

Accepting this offer ensures a reasonable payout considering the circumstances and avoids the risk of complete loss as the rounds dwindle."
