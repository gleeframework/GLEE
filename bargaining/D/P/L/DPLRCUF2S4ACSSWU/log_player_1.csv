"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than my initial offer.  While inflation is a factor, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can negotiate a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to reflect the inflation, but still offering a significant share to Bob. I'm hoping to incentivize him to accept, as we are getting closer to the final rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, considering the inflation that has taken place. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a split that is reasonably fair, given the significant inflation that has occurred. I'm hopeful that Bob will recognize that the value of the money is diminishing with each passing round, and he might be willing to compromise to avoid ending up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
