Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! Accept this offer and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: A decent start, but I'm looking for a better split. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $6,000 is actually $6,000 x 0.9 = $5,400.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer from Round 2.
