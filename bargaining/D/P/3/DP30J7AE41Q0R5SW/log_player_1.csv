"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll compare the values.

My gain in Round 1 was $60, which is still $60 in Round 2.
Bob's gain in Round 1 was $40, which is now worth 95% of $40, so $38 in Round 2.

Bob's offer is $45 for me and $55 for him, which is more than the equivalent value of his previous offer ($38 for me). I'll accept this offer.
