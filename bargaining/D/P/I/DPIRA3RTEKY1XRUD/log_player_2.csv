Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer considers the inflation but is still fair to me. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700
