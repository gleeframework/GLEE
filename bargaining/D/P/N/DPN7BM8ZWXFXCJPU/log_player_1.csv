"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. This is a good starting point, and I think it's a fair and reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly better deal, but I'm still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, but I'm willing to consider Bob's revised offer.

After calculating the new values due to inflation, I see that the money I gain is worth 95% of the original amount, and Bob's gain is worth 90% of the original amount.

With that in mind, I'll make a decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not ready to accept a 50-70 split just yet. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-70 split, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's closer to a 50-50 split. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a 55-45 split is a fair compromise""}

I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this revised offer and be willing to accept a more balanced split."
