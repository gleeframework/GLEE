"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I want a bit more for my efforts 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the offer. I was hoping for a better split, especially considering the inflation. I'm willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think the 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is still getting a decent amount. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
