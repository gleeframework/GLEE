"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I propose to keep $90 for myself and give $10 to Bob. This feels like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm losing money due to inflation, it's still better to reject and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm offering Bob $15 and keeping $85 for myself.  This is a compromise from my initial offer and reflects the fact that inflation is hurting me more than Bob. I believe this is a reasonable deal, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept Bob's offer.  While inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money I'm gaining, accepting this offer guarantees me some money.  It's not ideal, but given the potential for further losses due to inflation in future rounds, it's the most logical choice."
