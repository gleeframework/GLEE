"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a much fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. I think this offer is more fair to both of us, given the changing value of the money. Let's find a solution we can both agree on. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation factor means time is on her side. I need to push for a more significant gain in the next round."
