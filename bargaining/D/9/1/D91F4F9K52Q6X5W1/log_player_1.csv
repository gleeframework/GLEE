"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20, and I'll take 80.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm showing good faith by giving Bob a significant share. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a higher share this time. Accept this and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 60 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is less than my initial offer of 80.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Take 28, and I'll take 72. It's a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this time!"
