  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the game. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting 40% of the remaining money, which is less than my initial 50% offer. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive. I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think it's too skewed in Bob's favor. With inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, and I'd like to try to get a better deal before it's too late. I'm hoping Bob will make another concession next round."
