"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, you can't do better than this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small share, in the hopes that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, my gain of $5,000 is actually worth $4,500.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth 20% less, but I'll assume it is.

Considering the offer, I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a counter proposal in Round 3. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 10% less again, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,500.

I'll try to make a stronger offer to Bob. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $6,000, hoping that Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'll give you less than I offered before! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting!

Considering the offer, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $2,900 (10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.971 * 0.512 = 2,900).

Bob's gain of $6,000 is actually worth $3,144.80 (10,000 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.512 * 0.952 = 3,144.80).

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a genuine attempt to be generous or just a ploy to get me to accept. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it and make a new proposal in Round 5.

I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob, considering the reduced value of money. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, I'm taking control!""
