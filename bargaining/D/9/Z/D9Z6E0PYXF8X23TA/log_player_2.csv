"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a risky move, but it's essential to establish some leverage.  Since Alice is starting with such a lopsided offer, it's likely she underestimates the impact of inflation. By rejecting, Bob forces Alice to think about how much her share will be worth in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

This is a bold offer that attempts to establish fairness and a strong starting point for negotiation.  While it's still heavily weighted towards Bob, it allows for a potential middle ground in the future.  Alice's reaction will reveal how she views inflation and the importance of a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still trying to get the majority share.  This offer is still incredibly lopsided, and the impact of inflation is likely being underestimated by her.  It's crucial to continue to reject these offers to see if she'll become more reasonable as we get closer to the later rounds and the impact of inflation truly starts to bite."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which is fair in principle.  It's likely that inflation is starting to affect Alice's calculations now. By offering an equal split, Bob demonstrates a willingness to compromise and potentially forces Alice to reconsider her strategy.  It's time to see if she's ready to negotiate in earnest."
