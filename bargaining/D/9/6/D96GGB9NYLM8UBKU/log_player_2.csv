"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical, Bob. Take this offer before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current offer is too skewed in Alice's favor, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to potentially get a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation I'm facing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. I'm being more than fair, considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer as well. Although inflation is eating away at my potential gains, accepting 2500, which is now worth even less due to inflation, still seems too low compared to Alice's gain. I'll risk another round to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation, I'm willing to compromise but still believe a more balanced split is fair.""}"
