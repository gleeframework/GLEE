"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle this round.  I think a 50/50 split is fair, considering the inflation we're both facing. We can work out a more dynamic split in future rounds if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal for Bob in the long run, accepting now is better than risking further inflation. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  Each round, Bob loses 20% of the value. Waiting means getting a smaller and smaller piece of the pie from his perspective.
* **Alice's Stable Value:** Alice doesn't experience inflation, so she's content to wait for a better deal.  
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer a better deal in later rounds. She might even propose something worse, knowing Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation. 

Taking the $500,000 now guarantees Bob a reasonable sum, even if it's not the ""lion's share"" he might have aimed for initially."
