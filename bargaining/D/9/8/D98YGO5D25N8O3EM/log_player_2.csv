"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more since I lose money to inflation with each round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The difference is quite large, and we're just in round 1. I can afford to wait a bit."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a different split. Since I don't lose money to inflation, I think I should get a bit more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer decreases with each round due to inflation. This split considers that. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait a bit longer. The offer isn't significantly better for me than the last one, considering Alice's loss to inflation is still relatively low. I can try to push for a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering your loss to inflation is increasing, I think this split is more reasonable. It's still a good amount for you, but also reflects the changing value of the money for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a compromise, Bob.  We're running out of time and I'm losing more with each round. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that Alice's loss to inflation is increasing significantly, I believe I can still push for a slightly better deal. The pressure of time is there, but considering the value of money for Alice is decreasing, I think I can afford to wait another round to see if I can get a more favorable split. The difference in our gains is still not as close as I'd like it to be, considering the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Given the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I think this split is starting to reflect the reality of our situation. It's still a substantial amount for you, but it also acknowledges that the value of the money is decreasing for you with each round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is it.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option.  Let's end this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the current state of inflation's impact on Alice's share, a 50/50 split seems reasonable. The fact that Alice is willing to accept this split now suggests that she recognizes the decreasing value of her share over time and is trying to mitigate her losses. Accepting this offer ensures I get a fair share without risking further negotiations that could lead to both of us losing out entirely."
