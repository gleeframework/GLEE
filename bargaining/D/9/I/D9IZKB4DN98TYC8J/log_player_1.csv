"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of 600,000 is actually worth 540,000 in the first round's money, which is a decent amount. But I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

For now, I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and I want to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal, I'll propose:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'm taking a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split! That's a bold move!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 500,000 is actually worth only 365,000 in the first round's money, which is a decent amount. But I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal.

However, I also don't want to risk going to the next round, where the money will be worth even less. So, I'll accept this offer.
