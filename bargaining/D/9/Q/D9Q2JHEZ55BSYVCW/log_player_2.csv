Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was kind, but doesn't make sense with the inflation.  Let's be realistic: I propose 70 for me and 30 for you.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm not comfortable with such a large disparity.  Let's split it closer to the middle.  I'll take 45, and you can have 55. This is a fairer compromise in light of the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45
