"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 400k and keep 600k for myself.""
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the next offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 300k. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, Bob! I'll give you 450k, but I think I deserve a bit more for being patient.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 450k, but I'm not going to let you get the better end of the deal again! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Bob's offer is essentially the same as my previous offer, but with a slight adjustment. Considering the decreasing value of money, I think I should try to get a bit more. However, I don't want to reject again and risk getting an even worse deal.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not happy about it.
