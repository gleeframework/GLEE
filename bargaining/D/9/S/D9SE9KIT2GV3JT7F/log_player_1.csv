"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous offer considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the offer is now 50/50, I'll accept it.
