"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal for myself. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to give up too much, but I'm also not eager to risk going to the next round. Considering the inflation, I think this offer is not bad.
