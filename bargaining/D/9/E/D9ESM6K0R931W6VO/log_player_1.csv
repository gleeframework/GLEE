"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a small share 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money has decreased, so I need to be more cautious.

I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Since Bob's offer was 80-20, I'll try to aim for a 55-45 split. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}
```"
