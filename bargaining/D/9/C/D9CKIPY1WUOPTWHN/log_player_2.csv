Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation and the impact of inflation.
We are in Round 2 of the game. In Round 1, Alice offered a division of $100 where she would take $60 and I (Bob) would take $40. I rejected this offer. Now, due to inflation, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Alice.

### Step 2: Calculate the adjusted value of the money for both players after Round 1.
For me (Bob), the money is worth 10% less, so the $100 is now worth $90.
For Alice, the money is worth 5% less, so the $100 is now worth $95.

### Step 3: Determine a fair offer considering the adjusted values.
Given the adjusted values, a fair offer would split the $100 in a way that considers the loss of value for both players. Since Alice's money value decreased less, she has a slight advantage.

### Step 4: Decide on the offer.
I will offer Alice $55 and take $45 for myself. This offer slightly adjusts for the inflation impact, making it more favorable for me compared to the original offer but still reasonable for Alice.

### Step 5: Formulate the message to Alice.
The message will highlight the consideration of inflation and the adjusted value of the money, emphasizing that this offer is a compromise.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to make it fair for both of us.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is still too much in your favor. Let's split it 58/42.  We both lose some due to inflation, but this feels fairer. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the current situation and the new offer from Alice.
Alice has rejected my offer from Round 2 and has made a new proposal for Round 3. The new offer is to split the $100 into $58 for Alice and $42 for me. This comes after considering the inflation, which has reduced the value of the money further.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on the new offer.
Given the inflation, the money I gain is now worth 19% less than in the first round, and for Alice, it's worth 9.75% less. This means the actual value of the money for me is significantly less than the face value.

### Step 3: Calculate the real value of the offer after inflation.
For me (Bob), the $42 offered is actually worth less due to the 19% decrease in value. So, the real value is $42 * 0.81 = $34.02.
For Alice, the $58 is worth less due to the 9.75% decrease. So, the real value for her is $58 * 0.9025 = $52.345.

### Step 4: Determine if the offer is acceptable.
Considering the real values, the gap between what Alice and I receive is significant. However, the decreasing value of money with each round means that prolonging the game may not be advantageous.

### Step 5: Decide on the response to Alice's offer.
Given the decreasing value of money and the relatively small difference in our offers, accepting this offer might be more beneficial than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
