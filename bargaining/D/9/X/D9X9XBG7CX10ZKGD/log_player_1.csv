Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 55/45 split, with me getting 55 and Bob getting 45.  This seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose an even split of $50 each. Since we're both losing money with each round, it seems like the fairest option."
