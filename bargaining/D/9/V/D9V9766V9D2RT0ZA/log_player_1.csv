"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get a good start, Bob! Take the smaller share for now, and we can negotiate more in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not afraid to start strong, Alice. Take this and let's see if you can do better! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is confident!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $400,000 x 0.95 = $380,000
* Bob gain: $600,000 x 0.95 = $570,000

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll play it safe for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You started strong, Bob, but I'm not backing down! Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a better deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping to find a more balanced deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not willing to meet in the middle, Alice? I'll give you a slight edge, but don't think you're getting off that easy! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still pushing for a bigger share!

Considering the inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $450,000 x 0.8554 = $384,435
* Bob gain: $550,000 x 0.8554 = $469,697.50

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, Bob, but don't think you're getting away with it that easily! Let's meet closer to the middle this time.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 49-51 split, trying to find a more balanced deal."
