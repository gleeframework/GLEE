"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both be happy with this.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I would get 60 dollars and Bob would get 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's be equal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. The 50-50 split proposed by Bob is actually a pretty good deal, considering the reduced value of the money.
