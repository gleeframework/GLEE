"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's work together. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $8,000 from the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, so I'm effectively getting $6,400 in this round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting $4,500 and Bob is getting $5,500. I think this is a good compromise, so I'll accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
