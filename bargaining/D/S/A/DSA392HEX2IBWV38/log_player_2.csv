"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm willing to give you a little more since you'll be losing more value in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money loses value with each passing round, I'm hoping to get a better deal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome. I'll make a proposal for Round 2.\n\n###\n\nMy proposal will be:\n\n# Bob's message: I'd like a bit more, considering I'm losing more value each round. \n# Bob gain: 5500\n# Alice gain: 4500\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this to Alice. I'm looking forward to her decision."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering I'm losing more value each round.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision. I'm looking forward to her response.\n\n###\n\nAlso, I'd like to confirm that the current value of the money for me is 90% of the original, which is 0.9 * 10,000 = 9,000 dollars. For Alice, it's 95% of the original, which is 0.95 * 10,000 = 9,500 dollars. Is that correct?"
