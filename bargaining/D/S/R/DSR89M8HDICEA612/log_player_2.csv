Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4500 is actually worth $2,700 in real terms. Alice's gain of $5500 is worth $5,500 in real terms.

I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses due to inflation.
