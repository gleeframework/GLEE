"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting 80 dollars and Bob getting 20 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, the effective amount I would get from Bob's offer is:

50 / 0.8 = 62.5

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, since I was hoping to get more. But I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. I'll propose a slightly higher amount for myself, but still leave some room for negotiation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will see the logic behind my offer and accept it!"
