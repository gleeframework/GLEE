{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This is a more equitable split, and while we both lose some value due to inflation, it's a fairer starting point for negotiation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we divide the money 6000 for me and 4000 for you. This maintains a reasonable difference while acknowledging the decrease in value. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
