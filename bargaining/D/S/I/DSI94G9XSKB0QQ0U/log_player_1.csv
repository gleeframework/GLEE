"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. However, Bob's offer is a significant one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
