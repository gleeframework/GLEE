"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm leaving some room for Bob to negotiate or accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is quite even, and I don't see any reason to reject it at this point. I'll accept his offer.

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
