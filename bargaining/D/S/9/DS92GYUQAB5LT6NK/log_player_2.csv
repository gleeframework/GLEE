Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you another chance. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While her offer seems better than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid inflation I'm experiencing.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a larger share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""We're running out of time. This is a fair 50/50 split to end this.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should accept this, the inflation is really hurting your share. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is getting dangerous. While the offer is still not ideal, the inflation is eating away at my potential gains at an alarming rate. If I push further and Alice doesn't budge, I risk ending up with nothing. Better to accept a smaller share now than a much smaller share later, or even worse, nothing at all."
