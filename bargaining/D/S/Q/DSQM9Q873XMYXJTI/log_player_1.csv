Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a balanced division.""}

# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:
