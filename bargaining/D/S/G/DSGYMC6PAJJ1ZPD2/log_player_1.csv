"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm trying to maximize my gain 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 20% less value of the money, but I'll think carefully about the offer.

Since Bob is offering me $200,000, which is worth 95% of the original $250,000 (due to inflation), I'll have to consider whether it's a good deal.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous offer, giving Bob $700,000, which is still a significant portion of the total amount. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the offer, I'm not thrilled about the paltry $100,000 I'd be getting, which is worth only 83.74% of the original $120,000. However, I'm not sure if I can do better.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
