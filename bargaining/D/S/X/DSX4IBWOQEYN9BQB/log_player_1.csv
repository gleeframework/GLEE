"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to receive $60, while Bob receives $40. I'm attaching a message saying ""Let's be fair!"" to convey a sense of reasonableness and encourage Bob to accept the offer. Since it's the first round, the money is still worth its full value to both of us. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic. This offer won't be as good next round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth the same to me as in the first round, I can evaluate the offer based solely on the amount. Bob is offering me $45, which is less than the $60 I proposed in the first round. Given that the money's value hasn't changed for me, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. Additionally, Bob's message hints that the offer might worsen in the next round, but I'm willing to take that risk to potentially get a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this offer, I, Alice, am proposing to receive $58, while Bob receives $42. Since the money's value hasn't changed for me, I can maintain a relatively high proposed amount. However, I've reduced my proposed amount by $2 compared to the first round to show some willingness to compromise. I'm attaching a message saying ""Let's find a middle ground!"" to convey my intention to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable deal. Let's see how Bob responds!\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous. It's a fair split, take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\nSince the money's value hasn't changed for me throughout the rounds, I can evaluate the offer solely based on the amount. Bob is offering me $50, which is a 50/50 split. Considering that Bob's gain is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, this offer is actually more favorable to me than it initially seems. Additionally, Bob's message suggests that he is unwilling to negotiate further, so I'll accept this offer to ensure a fair split and end the game."
