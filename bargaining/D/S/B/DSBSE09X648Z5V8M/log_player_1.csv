"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to get a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 90% of the original $5000, which is $4500. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 80% of the original $5000, which is $4800.

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather get more than $4500. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation, my gain is worth 81% of the original amount (90% * 90% = 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81). So, I'll offer a slightly lower amount to account for the reduced value of money.

Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400
}"
