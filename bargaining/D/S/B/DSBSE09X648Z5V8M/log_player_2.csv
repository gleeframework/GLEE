"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, it's now worth 80% of its original value, which is $8,000.

My offer:
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6400 
# Alice gain: 3600 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

Original money: $8,000 (from round 2)
Inflation reduction: 36% of $8,000 is $2,880
Actual money left: $8,000 - $2,880 = $5,120

Alice's offer:
Bob gain: $6,400
Alice gain: $3,600

Since $6,400 is more than $5,120, I accept the offer.
