"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 for myself and give $1,000 to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, as it gives Bob something while ensuring I get the majority of the money. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation makes this offer a better deal than rejecting it and risking getting even less in the next round."
