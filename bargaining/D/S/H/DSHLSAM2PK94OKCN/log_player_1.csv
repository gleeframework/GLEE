"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm starting with a fair and equal split to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not accepting this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, my proposal is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to get a better share, considering the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I'm accepting this offer because the money is getting scarcer, and I'd rather take 3000 now than risk getting nothing if we reach the 12th round."
