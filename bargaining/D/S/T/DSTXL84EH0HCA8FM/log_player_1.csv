I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor, as I have a larger stake in seeing the money diminish less with each round.  Let's see if Bob agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to play. The inflation rate is higher for me than for Bob, so it is in my best interest to wait for a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

I'm offering a 8000/2000 split in my favor. While the inflation rate is higher for me, I believe this is a reasonable offer that gives Bob a decent share while still ensuring a large portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. While the inflation is hurting me, I believe I can still get a better split than this. The game is becoming more risky, but I'm willing to gamble on a more favorable outcome in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a 7000/3000 split. The inflation is really hitting me hard now, but I need to make sure I get enough to make this worthwhile.  This offer gives Bob a decent share, and I'm hoping he'll accept it before the inflation gets even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is really hurting me now, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  He's getting a much better deal than I am, and I'm hoping I can still find a better split. I'm running out of time, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a 6000/4000 split.  The inflation is really starting to bite, and I'm taking a bigger risk by continuing to play.  However, I think a 60/40 split is still a fair deal, and I'm hoping Bob will realize this before it's too late for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am still rejecting Bob's offer.  The inflation is hurting me deeply, and I'm losing a significant portion of the money with each passing round. However, I'm still holding out for a better deal.  The game is getting very risky, but I'm hoping to get a more equitable split in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

The inflation is making this game very difficult.  I'm taking a huge risk, but I'm offering a 50/50 split.  We both are losing a lot of money at this rate, and this seems like the only fair way to split the remaining value. I'm hoping Bob sees that this is the best way to get anything out of this situation."
