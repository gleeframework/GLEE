"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him than my initial offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a slightly better deal.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my original offer, but still takes into account the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob!

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by the inflation. However, Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

Comparing this offer to my initial offer, I can see that Bob is getting a slightly better deal. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a reasonable compromise.
