Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I want to keep some for myself to account for the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
