"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 20% share for Bob and 80% for me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a fair split in terms of percentages (80% for Bob, 20% for me), the actual amount I would gain ($4,500) is still a significant reduction from the original $8,000 I proposed in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share to account for the inflation. Accept this and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 40% share for Bob and 60% for me. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
