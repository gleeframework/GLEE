"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority but you'll get a decent share""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent majority, but I want a bit more for myself 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the actual values. Bob is offering me $70, which is worth $63 after inflation (since it's 10% less than the original 100%).

I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want to be the majority shareholder""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and Bob gets 45%, which is $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm getting desperate, so take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's getting desperate!

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the actual values. Bob is offering me $75, which is worth $72.50 after inflation (since it's 27.1% less than the original 100%).

I'm tempted to take it, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal I can get. I'll think about it...
