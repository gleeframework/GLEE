"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the lion's share!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking. In this round, my gain of $5,000 is actually equivalent to $4,500 in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a decent compromise, but I'm not thrilled about giving up the extra $1,000 I was initially hoping for. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to... {""decision"": ""accept""}"
