Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 40% for me and 60% for you.""}\n\nSince there's inflation, I want to try to end the game as soon as possible while still getting a somewhat fair deal. I'm hoping Alice will accept 60% and we can both walk away with a good amount of money."
