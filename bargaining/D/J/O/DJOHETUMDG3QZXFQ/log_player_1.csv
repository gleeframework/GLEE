"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 475000,
  ""bob_gain"": 525000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since my gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking again.

Comparing my offer from round 3 to Bob's offer from round 4, I think I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
