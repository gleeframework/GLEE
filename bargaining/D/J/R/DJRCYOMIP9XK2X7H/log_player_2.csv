"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $70, you take $30. A fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with taking only $30. I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the inflation.  Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we're both losing money.  I'll come down to $65, you get $35.  Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more,  it's better to take the offer and secure some money before the inflation eats away at the value even further."
