"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate if you want more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. Let's see what he has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I was too generous, huh?

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I think I can do better than a 60-40 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're right, I was too generous. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to keep the majority.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need for more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split? That sounds reasonable!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. A 50/50 split is a fair deal, and I'm willing to end the negotiations here."
