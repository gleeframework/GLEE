"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nMy proposal is to divide the money such that I receive $6000 and Bob receives $4000. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the offer appears to be a fair split, I can try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round, considering the inflation affects Bob's gain more than mine. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\nI've made a new proposal where I receive $5500 and Bob receives $4500. My message to Bob suggests meeting in the middle, which might be more appealing given the effects of inflation on his gain. Let's see how Bob responds this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sticking with my original proposal. 50/50 is the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer again. Although the offer is still a 50/50 split, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of Bob's gain, making it less appealing for him. I'll try to take advantage of this situation and negotiate for a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nI've made a new proposal where I receive $5800 and Bob receives $4200. My message to Bob points out that, considering the significant effect of inflation on his gain, this offer is more than fair. I'm trying to persuade Bob to accept this deal, as the value of his gain will continue to decrease in future rounds. Let's see how Bob responds this time!"
