It's too early to accept such an unequal split. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."

# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is more than fair 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, the inflation is really hurting me. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something at all."
