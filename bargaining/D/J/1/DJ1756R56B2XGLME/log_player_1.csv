"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 7:3""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70:30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm actually trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $60 is worth 10% less than the $70 I was offered in the first round, so it's equivalent to $63 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure I like this offer, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, my proposal is equivalent to a 66.67:33.33 split in the first round's value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground and make a more moderate proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value fast!

Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of $50 is equivalent to $71.43 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure I'm willing to give up the extra $5.43 in value that I would get with a 55:45 split. But I do like the idea of meeting in the middle, and this offer is a good compromise.
