"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation in the future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to go easy on you. This is a fair compromise.""}

I'm trying to make a more aggressive offer, taking 60% of the total amount, while still leaving Bob with 40%."
