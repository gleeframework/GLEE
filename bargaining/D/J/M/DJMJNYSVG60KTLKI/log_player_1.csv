Let's see if Bob likes my offer. I think it's fair!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer!  I'll take my chances with a new offer in round 3.  Inflation doesn't affect my gains this round, so I have leverage!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try to get a bit more this round. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in getting at least something, even if it's less than his initial proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I still reject this offer. I know the inflation is hitting Bob harder, but I'm holding out for more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to keep trying to get more, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I'm going to offer a bit more to Bob this round, hoping he sees the value in getting something now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still holding out for more. The inflation is really starting to hurt Bob, so I think I can get even more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm taking a bigger risk here. I'm realizing that Bob is getting hit harder by inflation and that I might lose out on getting anything if I keep rejecting offers. I hope this convinces him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. I know the inflation is really hurting Bob, and I'm still feeling confident that I can get a better deal. I'm starting to think that Bob might be trying to use the inflation to his advantage to get me to take a bad deal, but I'm not falling for it!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

We're getting close to the end of the game, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. This is a huge risk, but with inflation hitting Bob hard, I think he might accept a 50/50 split. It's the fairest offer I can make, given the circumstances."
