"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40 to get it over with quickly""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to get the game over with quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split it 60-40, but I think you should get the bigger share this time. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob wants to flip the script! Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% share, especially since I know the money is worth 10% less for me now. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than 40% now""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me a slightly larger share, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate."
