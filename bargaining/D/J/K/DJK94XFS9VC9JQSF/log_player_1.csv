"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and let's end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a straightforward and easy way to end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split the money more evenly, but his proposal is actually even more skewed in his favor than my original offer.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but still keeping a slightly larger share for myself."
