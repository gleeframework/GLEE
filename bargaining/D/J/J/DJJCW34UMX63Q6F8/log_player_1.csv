"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly now that we've both had a chance to propose. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current state of the game.
We are in Round 3 of the game. The money's value decreases by 10% with each round. In the previous rounds, neither my offer nor Bob's was accepted.

### Step 2: Calculate the current value of the money.
Given that the money's value decreases by 10% each round, and we are in Round 3, the money is now worth 90% of its original value from Round 2, and 81% of its original value from Round 1. Thus, the $100 is now worth $81 in terms of its original purchasing power.

### Step 3: Consider the previous offers and the need for a compromise.
My initial offer was 60-40 in my favor, and Bob's counteroffer was 40-60 in his favor. Neither was accepted. Given the decreasing value of the money and the limited number of rounds, there's pressure to reach a compromise.

### Step 4: Formulate a new offer that takes into account the need for compromise and the decreasing value of the money.
Considering the rejection of the previous offers and the pressure to conclude the game before the money becomes worthless, a more even split seems necessary. However, given that I'm making the offer and we're under time pressure due to the inflation mechanism, I'll propose a slight adjustment from an even split, hoping it will be seen as a fair compromise.

### Step 5: Create the offer in the required JSON format.
Given the considerations above, I'll offer a split that is slightly in my favor but acknowledges the need for a compromise and the urgency of the situation.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Compromise considering time pressure and previous offers.""}"
