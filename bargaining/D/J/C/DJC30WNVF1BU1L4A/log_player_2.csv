Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair, considering the inflation. Let's end this game. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI\'m not going to accept a 50/50 split when I know that the money is worth less to Alice due to inflation. I think I can negotiate a better deal for myself. Let\'s see what happens in the next round.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please provide the next message from Alice."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a decent share after inflation. Let's split it closer to 50/50. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, I think Alice's offer is reasonable. The money is worth 18.55% less to her than it was in the first round, so a 55/45 split is actually more in my favor than it initially seems. I'm willing to accept this offer and end the game here.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please let me know if this is the end of the game."
