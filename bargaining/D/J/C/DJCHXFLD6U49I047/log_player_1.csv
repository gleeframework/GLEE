"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
This is a 50-50 split, a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
