Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, hoping he'll accept to avoid further rounds.  Worst case, I can still negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, accepting a 50/50 split is the most logical choice.  The inflation is going to start eating away at my potential gains, and there's no guarantee Bob will be more generous in the future.  It's better to take what I can get now."
