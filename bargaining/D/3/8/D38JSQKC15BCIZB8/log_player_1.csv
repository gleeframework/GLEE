"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""I propose we split the money with a 70-30 ratio in my favor. This seems fair considering the risk and uncertainty of future rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 60 is a fair compromise considering we're starting from scratch. Let's take a chance on a 40-60 split. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
