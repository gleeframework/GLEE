I'm taking a bit of a risk here by offering Bob a smaller amount. But since I know the money will lose value with each round, I want to maximize my share as quickly as possible.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the value of money is dropping fast.  Accepting this offer guarantees me at least $3,000, which is better than risking getting nothing in the next round.  Plus, Bob seems to be negotiating aggressively, so I don't want to push my luck."
