"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a generous share, and I'm keeping 60 dollars for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I need to reassess the offer.

Initially, Bob's offer was 70 dollars, but since I'm getting 30 dollars, which is 20% less than 37.5 dollars (60% of 62.5 dollars, the original 60 dollars adjusted for inflation), I'll consider the effective value of my share.

However, considering the inflation effect, I'll focus on the percentage of the total, not the actual value. In the first round, I offered 60% of the original 100 dollars, and now Bob is offering 70% of the remaining 80 dollars (due to inflation). I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me.

I'll reject the offer for now and see if I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation (80% of 50% of the original value), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my offer for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! You're getting a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45 dollars, which is a smaller share than his previous offer, but I'm trying to make it more attractive by keeping 55 dollars for myself. The message is a bit more assertive, hoping to nudge Bob towards accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a good deal for you too! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the effective value of my share. The original 60 dollars would be worth around 31.2 dollars (60% of 50.4 dollars, the original 60 dollars adjusted for inflation).

Considering the offer, I'll get 20 dollars, which is a relatively small share. However, I'll think about the percentage of the total, not the actual value. In the first round, I offered 60% of the original 100 dollars, and now Bob is offering 20% of the remaining 51.2 dollars (due to inflation). This is a significant reduction in my share.

I'll reject the offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 51.84% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

Here's my offer for round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Time to make a deal! I'm willing to give you a bigger share.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 60 dollars, which is a larger share than before, but I'm keeping 40 dollars for myself. The message is a bit more conciliatory, hoping to make a deal with Bob."
