"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see where we go from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm curious to see what Bob will say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'm starting low. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll need to reassess the offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal, considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the initial high offer I made. Let's meet closer to the middle, but I'm not going all the way down to 300,000.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between compromise and asserting my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than 40%. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 27.1% less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% split, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 45% is a fair split considering the initial offer I made and the value of the money. Let's meet somewhere in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that balances my initial value with the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still too high, Alice. I think we're close, but I'm not giving in yet. Let's meet you at 50/50, like we started. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 40.95% less due to inflation, I'll need to reassess the offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 6.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm surprised Bob is suggesting a 50/50 split again, considering I've made concessions and adjusted my offer multiple times. I'm not willing to go back to the original starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much from my previous offer, but I'm willing to give you a slight edge. Let's see if you're willing to meet me at 48/52.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's closer to my previous offer, but still gives Bob a slight advantage."
