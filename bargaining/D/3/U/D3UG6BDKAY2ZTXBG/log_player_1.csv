I propose to take $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I get the majority but Bob still gets a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob slightly, to $200,000. This is still a good deal for me, and hopefully, it's enough to convince Bob to accept before inflation eats away at his potential gains further."

# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round. I'm going to hold out and see if I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm going to increase my offer to Bob again, to $300,000. Inflation is hitting him hard, and I think this might be enough to convince him to take the deal."

Even though inflation is hitting Bob hard, he's starting to get a better deal. It's time to accept before it gets any worse."
