"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I want a bit more for myself, it's a tough negotiation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation, $4000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's a decent offer. However, I'm not sure if I should give Bob a bigger share, considering he rejected my initial offer.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4800, but I'm not giving up yet, I want more! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is heating up!

Considering the inflation, $4800 is now worth 38.4% of what it was in the first round, which is a decent offer. However, I'm not sure if I should give Bob an even bigger share, considering he rejected my previous offers.

I'll think carefully before making a decision...

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make another move!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a decent chunk for myself!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 50/50, it's the last chance! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds like a good compromise, especially considering the significant inflation that has occurred. $5,000 is now worth a relatively small amount, but it's still a decent share.

I'll accept this offer and end the game.
