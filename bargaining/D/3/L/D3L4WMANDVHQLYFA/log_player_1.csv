"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. Since the money is worth the same for both of us in the first round, I'll propose a 60-40 split in my favor, hoping that Bob will find it reasonable and accept. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and increase the chances of him accepting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn.  This offer is more in line with the declining value for you in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer because, although the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round or force Bob to make an even more favorable offer. Accepting 45% of the original amount, considering the 20% decrease in value, seems less favorable than trying to get a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the circumstances""}\n\nGiven that the money's value decreases by 20% for me with each round, I'll propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This offer acknowledges the devaluation of the money for me while still attempting to secure a slightly larger share. The message ""Considering the circumstances"" aims to convey that I'm taking into account the impact of inflation on my gains and trying to find a mutually acceptable solution."
