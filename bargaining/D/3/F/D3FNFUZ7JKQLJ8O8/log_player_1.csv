"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 90% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with $1,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as keen on the offer as I was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value now, I'll aim to take a larger share to account for the reduced value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth even less now, I'll consider this offer more seriously. However, I'm still not convinced that I should take only 40% of the remaining value.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money is worth 60.8% of its original value now, so I'll aim to take an even larger share to account for the reduced value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8500,
  ""bob_gain"": 1500
}
```"

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth so little now, I'll consider this offer more seriously. Taking only 20% of the remaining value might be a good compromise to avoid going into further rounds.

I'll accept this offer.
