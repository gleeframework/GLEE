"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob! You'll get $100000 and I'll get the rest. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000

It's risky to accept such a small share so early on.  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Alice. It's a fair start, and we can avoid the risk of inflation."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you $300000, but I need the majority to cover the inflation risk. Don't try to lowball me, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to take the lion's share. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a more equitable split to consider accepting."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering 40% for myself and 60% for you. We're both losing value with each round, so let's work together to find a solution.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I need to be realistic about the inflation. You're not getting 40% without giving me a bigger share. Meet me in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to a more equitable split, and with each round, the inflation is eroding our potential gains. It's time to take what I can get and end the game."
