"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this offer is more realistic considering the inflation.  Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""This offer still heavily favors you, Bob. Let's find a more balanced solution."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation, it still gives him a significantly larger share.  Alice needs to hold out for a more equitable split, even with the increasing inflation pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's meet in the middle. This offer reflects the time pressure and gives us both a reasonable share.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Time is running out and we both lose if this fails. Let's be sensible. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"",
""message"": ""Okay Bob, a 50/50 split it is. Let's settle this before we lose more to inflation."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 8 rounds remaining and inflation eating away at the value, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly.
* **Fairness:** While Alice was initially aiming for a larger share, Bob is correct that a 50/50 split is inherently fair.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might force Bob into a corner and make him less likely to offer even a 50/50 split later. 

Accepting now secures a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances."
