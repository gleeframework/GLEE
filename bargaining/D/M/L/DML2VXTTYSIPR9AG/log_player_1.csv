"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 400k, but I'm hoping we can do better than that.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this and be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better offer. You can't do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my potential gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round. Bob's gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not convinced that I'm getting a good deal. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not convinced that's the best you can do, Bob. I'm hoping for a better offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still hoping for a better split.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and still getting a decent amount myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my potential gain is now worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 40.2% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the split, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out. I'm not sure if I can do better, and Bob seems determined to stick to this offer. I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob, I'll take it. But I'm not happy about it.""
}
