"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I need to be careful not to give up too much.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and I'm trying to maximize my gain, I'll offer a slightly higher percentage to Bob. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less, I need to be very careful not to give up too much.

I'll calculate the effective value of Bob's gain in the first round, which is 100 * (1 - 0.488) = 51.2. This means Bob's offer is equivalent to 62 / 51.2 = 1.21 times the value of his gain in the first round.

Considering this, I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation getting worse, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll offer a smaller percentage to Bob. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```"
