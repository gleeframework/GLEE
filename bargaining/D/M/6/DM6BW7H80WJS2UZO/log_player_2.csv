Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to try and get a better deal.  Even though I'm taking a risk, I'm hoping to get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Alice will accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though I'm getting less than my initial proposal,  I'm aware of the inflation affecting my earnings. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the next round."
