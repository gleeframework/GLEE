"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
``` 
I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, as a starting point.  I believe this is a fair offer, but I'm open to negotiating further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split.  The inflation is starting to take its toll, and this seems like a fair and equitable solution to ensure we both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm sticking with a 50/50 split.  We're losing value rapidly, and this is the only way to ensure we both get a decent share.  Hopefully, Bob will see reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is not acceptable.  Even with inflation, Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I can't accept a deal that drastically favors Bob.  This offer is a 45/55 split in Bob's favor, a slight concession on my part.  Hopefully, he will recognize the value of reaching a deal before we lose even more money."
