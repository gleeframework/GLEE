"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want to keep a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, his actual gain in this round is equivalent to $4800 (6000 / 0.8). This is still a significant advantage for Bob.

However, I'll consider the fact that this is a slightly better deal than his initial rejection, and I don't want to give up too much more. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal, trying to take into account the inflation effect and the fact that Bob is still getting a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""
}
```

This offer is a slight compromise, but I'm still trying to get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, Bob's gain in this round is equivalent to $5200 / 0.516 (1 - 0.488) â‰ˆ $10080, which is actually a gain of 1080 dollars more than the initial $10,000. This is a very favorable deal for Bob.

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as it's still heavily skewed in Bob's favor. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal, trying to take into account the inflation effect and the fact that Bob is still getting a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to meet you at 52/48""
}
```

This offer is a slight adjustment from my previous one, trying to get a bit closer to a 50/50 split."
