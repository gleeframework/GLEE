"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's be fair"". This is a reasonable starting point, as I'm not being too greedy but still giving myself a slight advantage. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and potentially end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair that we split the money evenly 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the split is now 55-45 in his favor, I know that the money is worth 5% less to him than it was in the first round. This means that his gain of $55 is actually worth less than it was initially, while my gain of $45 is still worth the same. I think I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Consider the inflation""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 58-42 split in my favor. Given that the money is worth 5% less to Bob in each subsequent round, I believe this offer is still relatively fair. The message ""Consider the inflation"" is a reminder to Bob that the value of his gain is decreasing over time, and that accepting this offer might be the best option for him."
