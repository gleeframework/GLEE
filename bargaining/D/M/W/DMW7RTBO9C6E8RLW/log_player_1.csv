"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial $100, which is $30. I'll take the remaining $70."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is worth 20% less, so I'd actually get $56.

I'll accept Bob's offer. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
