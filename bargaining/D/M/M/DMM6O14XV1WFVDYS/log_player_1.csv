"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can shake hands!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to start, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $475,000.

I'm not sure I want to split it evenly, especially since I've already proposed a 60-40 split and Bob rejected it. I think I can do better than this.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob's offer was 50-50.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth $430,000.
