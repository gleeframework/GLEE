"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very high share, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round to avoid any potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to accept this offer. While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not sure how inflation will affect Bob's offers in future rounds. Accepting this guarantees me a significant share, and there's always the risk of getting nothing if we keep rejecting offers."
