Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40
