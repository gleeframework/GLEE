"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a 60-40 offer as well, but in my favor. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual value of my potential gain is 19% less than the nominal 30$. To calculate my actual gain, I'll multiply 30$ by 0.81 (1 - 0.19).

My actual gain would be 30$ * 0.81 = 24.3$

Since Alice's offer is 70-30, I'll reject it. I'll try to counter with a new offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. I'll aim for a 70-30 split, which would give me a higher actual gain. However, I'll adjust the numbers to account for the inflation.

Since my gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher nominal value. Let's say I'll aim for a 77.5-22.5 split.

Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 77.5, ""alice_gain"": 22.5}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

# Bob gain: 20

My actual gain would be 20$ * 0.653 = 13.06$

Since Alice's offer is 80-20, I'll reject it. I'll try to counter with a new offer.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the increasing inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer. I'll aim for a 90-10 split, which would give me a higher actual gain. However, I'll adjust the numbers to account for the inflation.

Since my gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher nominal value. Let's say I'll aim for a 91.5-8.5 split.

Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 91.5, ""alice_gain"": 8.5}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 8

Since my gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a higher nominal value. Let's say I'll aim for a 96.5-3.5 split.
