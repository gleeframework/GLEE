**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down.  While the difference is getting smaller, it's still heavily in her favor.  I'm willing to gamble a few more rounds to see if she cracks."

Round 6

""alice_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Okay, how about this?  A slight advantage for me, just to acknowledge the time pressure.  Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show some movement, but I'm also framing it as my final offer.  This puts the pressure on Alice. She knows I'm serious about getting a somewhat better deal, and the time pressure is only increasing for both of us."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm not 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing me.  While this offer isn't great, it's better than getting nothing in a few rounds. Alice is clearly content to wait me out."
