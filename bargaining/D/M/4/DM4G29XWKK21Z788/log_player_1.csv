"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further?""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of $5,000 each, and we can call it a day."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $4,000
* Bob's gain: $5,400 (since it's worth 10% less than his initial offer of $6,000)

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this deal. I'd like to negotiate further. I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer I made was 50/50.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $3,800 (5% of $4,000)
* Bob's gain: $5,220 (5% of $5,400)

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve the majority 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $3,450 (14.26% of $24,100, which is 10,000 * 0.9524, and then 5% less than $4,000)
* Bob's gain: $6,050 (27.1% of $21,500, which is 10,000 * 0.953, and then 10% less than $6,700)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's getting harder to negotiate. I'm starting to lose buying power, and I don't want to risk getting even less in future rounds.
