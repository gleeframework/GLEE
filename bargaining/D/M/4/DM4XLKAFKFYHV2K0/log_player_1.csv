"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started, I'll give you a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the initial $100, which is $30. I'll take the remaining 70% for myself, which is $70. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair share and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, let's see if you'll accept this time 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has taken its toll, and my potential gain is now worth 5% less than before.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

I'll accept this offer. I'll take the $40 and we can end the game here.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
