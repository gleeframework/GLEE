"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 20% share, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a more balanced split, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, my gain of 4000 is actually equivalent to 3800 in the previous round's value.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and keeping the game going to see if I can get an even better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your proposal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 4500 is worth 11.5% less than my initial gain of 8000 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, as it's a bit more skewed towards Bob's favor. However, I'm willing to consider it since it's closer to my previous offer. I'll accept this offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.
