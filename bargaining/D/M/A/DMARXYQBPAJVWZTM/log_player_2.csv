"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I take $6,000, you take $4,000.  It's better to settle now before inflation eats away at our potential gains.

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting us both. I'll take a slight hit from my previous offer, offering you $4,900.  Let's close this deal before it gets any worse. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Inflation is indeed taking its toll, but I believe my share should be higher considering the decreasing value. I'm willing to take 58% now.""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking another significant hit due to inflation.  Let's end this now before we both lose even more. $5,200 for you, and let's move on. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept this offer since the inflation is significantly reducing the value of the money for both of us, and further rounds may lead to even greater losses. This seems like the most reasonable option at this point."
