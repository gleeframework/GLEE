Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise. Take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While this offer is significantly less than I initially wanted, the inflation means my share is worth much less than in the first round. It's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
