"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, Bob. A slightly better deal for me since I'm taking the risk of going first.""
}
```
 
This offer aims to be reasonable and kickstarts negotiations. Here's why:

* **Fairness:** It's a roughly even split, showing I'm not trying to take advantage of Bob.
* **First Mover Advantage:** The slight edge for me acknowledges the risk I'm taking by proposing first. If Bob rejects this, the pot shrinks, and he might end up with even less. 

This strategy encourages Bob to accept a reasonable deal now, rather than gambling on future rounds with diminishing returns."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly now. Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob's offer is simply a reversal of my initial offer, taking advantage of the inflation to get a better deal for himself. While a 50/50 split is inherently fair, I'm not obligated to accept it after he rejected a similar offer that benefited me slightly. By rejecting, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at the cost of being exploited."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be real. The pot is shrinking, and this back-and-forth isn't helping either of us.  50/50 is the fairest solution. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Direct Approach:** I'm shifting to a firmer tone, making it clear that I'm serious about a 50/50 split and that further delays are pointless.
* **Highlighting the Loss:** By emphasizing the shrinking pot, I'm reminding Bob that every rejection makes the situation worse for both of us.
* **Ultimatum (Take it or Leave it):** This phrase adds weight to my proposal. While I'm not technically issuing a final ultimatum, it suggests I'm not willing to negotiate much further.

This strategy aims to end the game quickly with a fair outcome.  I'm hoping Bob understands that continuous back-and-forth is detrimental and that accepting a 50/50 split now is the most logical choice."
