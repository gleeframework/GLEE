"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me a large share (9000$) while still giving Bob something. Since it's the first round, the money is worth the most, so it's in my best interest to get the largest possible share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, and while the money is worth less now, it's still worth rejecting this offer and proposing a better one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm reducing my demand slightly to increase the chances of Bob accepting. The inflation is starting to bite, but I believe this offer is still fair while giving me a decent chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3600 
# Bob gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and while the value of the money is dropping, I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'll try to make a more appealing offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm reducing my demand further, aiming for a compromise. The inflation is becoming a serious concern, but I believe this offer is still advantageous for me considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4880 
# Bob gain: 5120 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still not ideal, the inflation is making the money significantly less valuable, especially for Bob. Accepting this offer will secure me a decent amount of money, even with the inflation. Continuing to reject offers could lead to a situation where we both end up with nothing."
