"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $100 and Bob gets 30%. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see if Bob will accept."
