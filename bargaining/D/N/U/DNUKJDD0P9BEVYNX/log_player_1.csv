"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can see if Bob is willing to accept a 50/50 split or if he wants to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I'll have to consider the reduced value due to inflation.

Since the money is now worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $3,000 * 0.9 = $2,700
* Bob gain: $7,000 * 0.9 = $6,300

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, considering the reduced value. I'll reject it for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit low, I'll try to make a new offer that's a bit more favorable to me, while still being reasonable. Considering the reduced value due to inflation, I'll offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment to the previous offer, considering the inflation!""
}
```

This way, I'm getting a bit more, but still leaving room for Bob to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, considering the inflation, but still a good one! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $4,000 * 0.7269 = $2,906.60
* Bob gain: $6,000 * 0.7269 = $4,376.40

Considering the reduced value, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable. I'll accept it.
