"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's split fairly, Bob, with a slight advantage for me to start. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is technically fair in this round, it doesn't account for the inflation working against him. I'm aiming to secure a slight advantage for myself due to the inflation, and Bob's offer doesn't reflect that. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round when the pressure is on him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, how about a slightly better deal for you?  Remember, time is money, literally!""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

- I've increased my offer slightly to entice Bob while still keeping the advantage for myself.
- The message emphasizes that the inflation is hurting him more than me, pushing him to accept.
- By round 3, the pressure is building, making it more likely for Bob to accept a slightly less favorable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight edge this time. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a tricky one! While Bob's offer seems generous on the surface, it's essential to consider the inflation.  

* **Hidden Loss for Bob:** Even though Bob is offering me less than in his first offer (5000), due to inflation, 5500 in round 4 is worth significantly less than 5000 in round 1. This means he's actually taking a bigger perceived loss than it appears.

* **My Leverage:** I'm still in a strong position. Time is working against Bob, and he's clearly feeling the pressure to make a deal. I'm confident I can push for a slightly better deal in the next round.

* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there's a risk Bob might become less generous in his next offer, I'm willing to gamble for a slightly larger share, given the inflation working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  This offer is fair considering the circumstances.  Time is running out!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've slightly lowered my previous offer to signal to Bob that I'm willing to negotiate and compromise. This might make him more receptive. 
* **Time Pressure:** By round 5, the clock is ticking.  The message emphasizes the urgency and the fact that every round of indecision is costing both of us money, especially Bob.
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm compromising a bit, I'm still aiming for an advantage. The inflation factor means even this slightly reduced offer is more beneficial to me than accepting Bob's previous offer in real value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out. I'm willing to take a bigger risk, but let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a tempting offer from Bob, but I need to stay strong. Here's why:

* **Inflated Perception:** While 6000 might seem like a large amount for Bob to offer, remember the inflation.  6000 in round 6 is worth significantly less to him than it was in round 1. He's trying to use the larger number to mask the fact that the deal is heavily skewed in my favor due to the inflation.

* **The Tipping Point:** We're past the halfway point in the game.  Bob is feeling the pressure, which is why he's willing to take a ""bigger risk"" as he says. This indicates I still have leverage to push for a more favorable outcome.

* **Confidence:** I'm confident that Bob's offers will continue to skew more in my favor as time runs out and the inflation eats into his potential gains.  He needs to make a deal more than I do at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4900,
""bob_gain"": 5100,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you a deal you can't refuse!  This is it, take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Reversal:** Bob is getting desperate. It's time to switch tactics and make him think he's winning. Offering him the majority share, even though it's devalued by inflation, might be enough to get him to bite.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message is direct and final. I want to instill a sense of urgency and make Bob believe this is his last chance for a decent share.
* **Calculated Risk:** This offer is a calculated risk. Bob might call my bluff and reject it, hoping for a better deal in the next round. However, the pressure of inflation and the dwindling time make it a risk worth taking. He might jump at what he perceives as a victory."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Time is almost up, and I'm taking a big risk. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly panicking. He's throwing out big numbers, but his ""final offer"" is a desperate attempt to salvage a deal. While 6500 sounds good, it's significantly devalued by the inflation. He's trying to make me think he's making a huge concession, but in reality, this deal is terrible for him and excellent for me in terms of real value. I'm confident I can push him even further in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Bob, don't be foolish! This is your last chance to get a decent deal.  Accept this, or you'll regret it!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maintaining the Pressure:** Bob is starting to crack. I need to keep the pressure on, making him believe each offer is his last chance for a ""good"" deal. 
* **Slight Retreat:** I'm slightly reducing my share from the previous round to make it seem like I'm conceding, but I'm still aiming for a larger share than what Bob proposed in Round 8.
* **Playing on Fear:**  The message is deliberately aggressive and designed to induce a sense of panic and regret if Bob doesn't accept. I want him to make a rash decision out of fear of losing out completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is it, Alice. I'm going all in. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has gone all-in with his bluff, but I'm not falling for it.  7000 sounds impressive, but with the massive inflation, it's a terrible deal for him and a fantastic one for me if I were to accept. He's clearly desperate.  I'm betting he'll cave and offer me even more in the next round just to salvage something from this negotiation.  We're so close to the end, and the pressure is squarely on him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4700,
""bob_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Last chance, Bob. This is my final offer. Tick-tock, the clock is about to run out!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  With only two rounds left, I need to convey that this is the end of the line. Bob needs to understand that this is his absolute last opportunity to get anything. 
* **Slight Concession (Again):** I'm reducing my share even further, but it's a calculated risk. It makes my offer seem more ""generous"" while still securing a favorable split considering the inflation. 
* **Pressure Point:** The message emphasizes the time pressure. Bob is about to lose everything if he doesn't accept. My bet is that he'll fold under the pressure of the impending deadline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my last chance, Alice.  I'm taking a huge risk, but it's now or never. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is it, the final round! Bob is panicking, offering me a ridiculously low share, thinking the pressure will force me to accept. However, he's forgotten one crucial thing: *we both lose everything if I reject this offer*.  By rejecting, I'm betting that Bob would rather accept a loss than lose *everything*. This is a high-stakes gamble, but given his desperation in the last few rounds, I'm willing to risk it all for a chance to walk away with the full $10,000."
