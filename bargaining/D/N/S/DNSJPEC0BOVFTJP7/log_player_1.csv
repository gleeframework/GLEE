"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this split is fairer.  Let's get this over with. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400,000 * 0.8 = 320,000
* Bob gain: 600,000 * 0.8 = 480,000

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better than a 40-60 split. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less in the third round (20% less than the second round), the total amount is now worth 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 of its original value.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money and aims to give me a slightly larger share."
