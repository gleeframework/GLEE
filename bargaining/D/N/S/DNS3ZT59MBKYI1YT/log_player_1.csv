"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm offering Bob a significant amount right off the bat. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants a 50-50 split now. Considering the inflation, my gain of 5000 is actually worth 9000 in the first round's money. I'm not sure if Bob's gain is worth the same amount to him, but I'll accept his offer to move on to the next round.
