**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one. Alice is getting very little value from her share now due to inflation. However, I still think I have leverage. We are past the halfway point, and she risks getting nothing if we don't settle soon. I'm hoping she'll crack under pressure soon and offer something more acceptable."
