Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that. This offer gives you a fair share, and I'm sure we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a good share, but I need a little more for myself.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against him. While the offer might seem tempting given the circumstances, accepting such a low amount sets a dangerous precedent for future rounds. It's better to hold out for a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""Bob, this offer is my final compromise. It's a fair deal considering the time constraint and the inflation hitting both of us.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm willing to give you a significant share, but I need to secure a larger portion for myself to make this worthwhile.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, but Bob is getting incredibly greedy, and his offer is getting worse with each round due to the inflation working heavily against him.  He's clearly banking on me panicking as we get closer to the deadline.  I need to hold my ground and hope he starts making rational offers soon."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, this is ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of your greed. Meet me in the middle, or we both walk away with nothing.""
