"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. It's a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my initial offer would have been worth less than I thought!

As for Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too even-handed. I'd like to get a bit more, considering I'm the one making the next offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself."
