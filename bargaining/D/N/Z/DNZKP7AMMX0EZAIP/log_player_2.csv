"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm sure you'll understand the value of getting something now. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: In this scenario, Alice is offering Bob $1000, which is only 10% of the total amount, while she takes 90%. Considering the inflation rates, if Bob waits, the money's value decreases more significantly for him than for Alice. However, accepting such a low offer right at the start without attempting to negotiate for a better share seems premature. Bob should reject this offer to try and negotiate for a better deal in the next round, despite the risk of inflation reducing the money's value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, I believe this is a fair offer.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given that Alice initially offered a 10% share to Bob, he decides to propose a more balanced division, taking into account the impact of inflation on both players. By suggesting a 40% share for himself and 60% for Alice, Bob aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to Alice, considering the devaluation of money over rounds affects him more significantly. This approach shows willingness to compromise while also attempting to secure a better deal than the initial offer."
