"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split.  Let's call it a day! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think this is a fair split at all! I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not fair, I want more!""
}
```

The money is worth 20% less now, so I'm looking for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. Let's settle this before we both lose more money. 
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me! I'm not going to fall for it. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not my final offer, Bob!""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the split, and I think I can do better."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 48.8% less now, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 576000,
  ""bob_gain"": 424000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob. Meet me halfway!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal for myself, but I'm also leaving some room for Bob to accept and end the game."
