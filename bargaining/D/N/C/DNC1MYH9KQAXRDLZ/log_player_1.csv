"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}

This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm willing to compromise to get the game started."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a larger share, but I'm not willing to give up that much.

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
