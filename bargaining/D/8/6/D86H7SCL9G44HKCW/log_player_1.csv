"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This offer gives me $80 and Bob $20, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this early and avoid any further risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a fair offer, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is already affecting the value of the money, so I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, Bob. I'll take 60, and we can still end this early if you want.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a slightly different split this time. I think 55/45 is a fair compromise.  We're getting closer to the end, and I'd rather avoid the risk of further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly! I'll think carefully about this offer... A 55/45 split is a bit more favorable to Bob, but it's still a decent compromise. I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to act quickly. I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Time is running out, Bob. I'm willing to take a bigger risk to get a better share. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to meet in the middle this time. I think a 40/60 split is fair, considering the time pressure and the risk of further inflation. It's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'm getting desperate. A 40/60 split is still a bit unfavorable to me, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll think carefully about this offer... I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further, but I'll have to be more cautious.
