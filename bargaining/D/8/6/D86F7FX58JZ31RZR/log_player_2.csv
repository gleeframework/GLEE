This is a tricky situation! Alice is pushing for a deal that is heavily in her favor.  While the offer is tempting, it's important to remember that the value of the money is shrinking rapidly.  Rejection keeps the possibility of a better deal open, although the risk of getting nothing is also increasing."

This is a risky move, but it's time to push back. Alice has been consistently offering deals skewed in her favor. While her offer in Round 9 is tempting, the inflation rate is hitting hard. This offer is the same as in Round 2, but the current value is lower, and Alice is likely to take a bigger hit from the inflation.  We have to see if she's willing to compromise."
