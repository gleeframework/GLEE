Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a potentially better offer. The current offer gives me 10% of the total, which might not be the best I can get. Let's see what I can propose in the next round. \n###\n\nYour turn! What's my proposal in Round 2? \n###\n\n(Remember that the money is now worth 5% less for me.)"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll try to negotiate for a better share. Since the money is now worth 5% less for me, I'll aim a bit higher to compensate for the loss in value.\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 175000, ""alice_gain"": 825000, ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}\n###\n\nYour turn! Will Alice accept this offer or proceed to the next round? \n###\n\n(Remember that if Alice rejects, the money will be worth another 5% less for me in the next round.)"
