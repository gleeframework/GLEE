"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's a decent amount, I'm hoping to get a better deal with the risk of inflation factored in.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but I need to factor in the inflation risk for both of us. This offer is a fair starting point.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is decreasing. This is a strong offer, let's close the deal and both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to my ideal split, but I'm still going to reject it.  The value of the money is decreasing faster for Alice, and I want to see if she'll make a bigger concession in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's split the money evenly.  The value is dropping rapidly for both of us, and this is the fairest way to ensure we both get a decent amount.""}
