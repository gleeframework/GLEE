"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""This is a fair deal considering the time pressure. Let's not risk losing everything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that the value for me is rapidly decreasing. However, accepting an offer where I get significantly less than half is a bad strategy. I need to show Alice I'm willing to risk it all to get a somewhat fair deal, even with the inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest outcome. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball.  By now, Alice should realize I'm not going to accept a deal heavily in her favor. Offering a 50/50 split, even with the reduced value due to inflation, shows I'm serious about getting a fair deal. The ""take it or leave it"" message emphasizes the urgency and my unwillingness to continually negotiate down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'final offer' wasn't final, was it? 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. However, accepting 44% at this stage would be a significant loss. It's better to hold out and see if I can get her to agree to a better deal in the remaining rounds. There's still a chance she'll become more agreeable as we approach the final rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Time is running out. I'm willing to compromise, but this is as low as I'll go.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to show some flexibility while still aiming for a relatively balanced outcome. A 48/52 split leans in Alice's favor, acknowledging the inflation pressure. The message emphasizes the urgency and sets a firm lower limit, hoping that Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise to avoid getting nothing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being patient, you're losing value 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. While 45% is far from ideal, rejecting this offer carries a significant risk. With only three rounds left, and the inflation eating away at my potential gains, I need to make a decision based on the likely outcome of continuing.  

Alice seems unwilling to budge much further, and I'm doubtful I can secure a significantly better deal in the remaining rounds. Accepting now secures something, which is better than the increasing risk of walking away with nothing."
