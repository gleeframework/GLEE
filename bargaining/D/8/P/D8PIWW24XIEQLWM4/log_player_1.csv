"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split. It's a more reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""I'll agree to a 55/45 split, but with me getting the larger share this time. It's getting late in the game, and the value is decreasing.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since the money is losing value for you, I think a 57/43 split is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 43 
# Bob gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his demand while acknowledging the money is losing value for me. This suggests he's aiming to pressure me into accepting a worse deal as time runs out.  I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Bob. I'm willing to go down to 52/48, but that's my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** By decreasing my share, I signal to Bob that I am willing to negotiate and compromise.
* **Firmness:**  The ""final offer"" statement introduces a sense of urgency and implies I'm serious about not going lower.
* **Time Pressure:** Highlighting the diminishing value adds weight to the need for a quick decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the rapidly decreasing value for you, I think 60/40 is a reasonable split at this point. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This is a terrible offer! Bob is going back to his initial proposal, completely disregarding the time pressure and the fact that the money is losing value for me.  I need to hold firm and hope he gets nervous as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous, Bob.  50/50 is the only fair deal. Take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to make a strong statement.  Offering a 50/50 split is fair and shows I'm willing to compromise significantly to end this.
* **Directness:**  The message is blunt and leaves no room for misinterpretation. Bob has been pushing for an unfair advantage, and it's time to call him out.
* **Urgency:** By framing it as ""take it or leave it,"" I'm emphasizing the limited time and the risk of both of us losing everything."
