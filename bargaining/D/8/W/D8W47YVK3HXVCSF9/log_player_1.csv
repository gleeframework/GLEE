"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split, but I'll give you a slight edge this time 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'm not as eager to accept a 50/50 split. However, I don't want to reject it outright, so I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll send a message to hint that I'm looking for a slightly better deal in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Okay, 50/50 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to improve my share in the next round""
}
```"
