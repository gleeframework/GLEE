"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with, a fair and simple way to begin.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a straightforward and fair way to start the game, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 50/50, now I'll offer you a slightly less favorable deal, but still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it.

For now, I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal. I'll try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly better deal. This way, we can both get a decent share and move forward.""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than his previous offer. I hope he'll consider it and accept it this time!"
