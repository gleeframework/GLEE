Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to take a little less to ensure we both get something.  Let's split it 55/45, with me taking the slightly larger share this time.  We can then alternate who gets the bigger share in the future rounds. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with each round. Let's be reasonable and split it 60/40 this time. I'll take the bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise. We can alternate again in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, but I need to hold firm for a bit longer.  While the value of the money is dropping fast, letting her get away with a 60/40 split in two rounds sets a bad precedent for the rest of the game.  There's a good chance she'll panic soon and offer something closer to even."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this back and forth is pointless. I'm compromising. This is the best offer you'll get.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to show some flexibility.  While I want a better than even split, I need to acknowledge the dwindling value of the money.  Offering 55/45 shows I'm willing to negotiate but still holding onto a decent advantage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are both running out of time. Let's end this.  I'm willing to take a larger share this time, but if you reject this offer, we both risk getting nothing at all.  It's a gamble, but I think we both need to make it. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but the risk of getting nothing is too high now. Alice is playing hardball, but her point about running out of time is valid. Accepting a 35/65 split is far from ideal, but it's better than zero."
