"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

This way, we both get a roughly equal share of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4000 in the first round.

I'm not convinced that this is a good compromise, since I was initially offered $6000 and now I'm being offered $5000, which is actually less than my initial offer. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I was willing to give you $4000 initially, and now you're offering me $5000? I'm not sure I'm ready to meet in the middle yet.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 64% of its original value due to the 20% inflation.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the inflation and the fact that Bob didn't accept my initial offer. I'll aim for a slightly higher share than my initial offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up my initial advantage. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up some of my gain to get closer to a fair split. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5500 in the third round is now worth 51.2% of its original value, so it's equivalent to approximately $2800 in the first round.

I'm not happy with Bob's new offer, as he's now trying to get a larger share of the money, which is even further from a fair split than his previous offer. I was hoping for a compromise, but this seems like a power play.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I don't think this is a fair split at all. I was willing to give you more in the previous round, and now you're trying to take even more? I'm not interested.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 40.96% of its original value due to the 20% inflation.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the fact that Bob's previous offers have been getting more and more aggressive. I'll aim for a slightly more conservative split, but still trying to get a good share of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give in to your aggressive offers, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I need something more reasonable.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, Alice. I'll give you a small advantage, but I need something better than this. Make a better offer or I'll walk away. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4200 in the fifth round is now worth approximately $2800 in the first round, which is equivalent to 28% of its original value.

I'm not impressed with Bob's new offer. He's trying to pressure me into accepting a significantly worse deal than my previous offer, and I'm not going to fall for it. I was hoping for a compromise, but this seems like a last-ditch effort to get a better deal for himself.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not desperate, Bob. I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me in the middle. Your offer is unacceptable.""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth approximately 33.64% of its original value due to the 20% inflation.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the fact that Bob's previous offers have been getting more and more aggressive. I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split, but still trying to get a good share of the money.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to get taken advantage of either, Alice. I'm willing to give you a small amount, but I need to get something in return. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3200 in the seventh round is now worth approximately $1600 in the first round, which is equivalent to 16% of its original value.

I'm not impressed with Bob's final offer. He's trying to strong-arm me into accepting a deal that's significantly worse than my previous offer, and I'm not going to fall for it. I was hoping for a compromise, but it seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and walk away.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to accept a deal that's so one-sided, Bob. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept this.""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I've rejected Bob's offer and it's the last round, I'll make a final offer. However, I'll make it a very aggressive one, since I'm not going to get another chance to negotiate.

In this round, my gain is worth approximately 12.8% of its original value due to the 20% inflation.

I'll make a final offer, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob is desperate.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 1000,
  ""bob_gain"": 9000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer, Bob. Take it or leave it. I'm not going to negotiate further.""
