"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%. We can talk about it later if you like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with that split, let's see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a more even split. This is a fair starting point for negotiations.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up some of my share, but let's be reasonable. 60/40 is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best way to secure a significant portion of the money.  The inflation is becoming a serious factor, and there's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in future rounds."
