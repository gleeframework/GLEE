"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve a bit more for my cleverness 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth less than before.

I'm not convinced that I deserve a smaller share, considering the inflation factor. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think my skills are worth more than you're getting!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a smaller share, but I think my skills are worth more than that. I'm willing to make a concession, but not too big 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain! With the money being worth 14.26% less than the original, I'm getting a bit desperate.

However, I'm not willing to give up that much more. I think 3000 is a bit too low, considering the initial offer was 5000 and now the money is worth less.

I'll try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential gain. I'll have to think carefully about my next move.

Considering the current value of the money, I'll aim for a higher share, but I'm not sure how much higher I can push it.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need something substantial in return. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
