"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront since the value decreases for me each round. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob and I'm not going to accept this offer. I want a more equitable split, and I'm willing to gamble on the next few rounds.  The value of the money is decreasing faster for Alice, so I might get a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share before the money starts losing value too quickly.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want an even split, Bob, but time is running out for me. I need a slight advantage to account for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is still trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm not convinced that her offer is fair, especially since she's already getting a significantly larger share. I'm going to keep rejecting these proposals and hope to negotiate a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Alice. Let's split it 45/55. It's a fairer deal than the previous offers, and we can both get a decent amount before the money loses too much value.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, I'm trying to meet you halfway. Let's do this to avoid any further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice has finally made a concession and offered a split that's close to my last proposal. The inflation is hitting her hard, and I'm not sure I'll get a better offer in the next few rounds.  I'll accept this to avoid further risk."
