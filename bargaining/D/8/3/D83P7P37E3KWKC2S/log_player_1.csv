"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
``` 
 
I propose a 95/5 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point considering the inflation dynamic, and allows room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm offering an 85/15 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my previous offer, taking into account Bob's increased ""discount"" on his share.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer, given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial proposal, it is still not a fair reflection of the inflation dynamic and my current bargaining power. I will continue to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering an 80/20 split.  This is a further compromise, but still reflects the substantial impact of inflation on Bob's share.  I'm hopeful that this offer will be accepted, as we are getting close to the end of our time to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I acknowledge the significant inflation impacting Bob's share, a 50/50 split is still not fair considering the larger discount on his gains. I'm willing to negotiate further, but a 50/50 split doesn't reflect the current circumstances."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm offering a 75/25 split in my favor. This is a significant concession on my part, as I'm aware of the increasingly drastic impact of inflation on Bob's potential gains. I believe this offer represents a fair balance between our interests given the remaining time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is now significantly skewed due to inflation. While I understand the substantial impact on his gains, a 40/60 split is not justifiable given the remaining rounds and the current value of our potential shares.  I will continue to push for a more balanced division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I am offering a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a further concession from my previous offer, acknowledging the increasing impact of inflation on Bob's share. With only four rounds remaining, I believe this is a reasonable compromise that allows both of us to gain something before the value of the money drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unrealistic.  The inflation impact on his share is significant, but a 30/70 split is simply not justifiable given the remaining rounds and the value of our potential shares.  I will continue to push for a more balanced division, even if it means both of us getting a smaller share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I am offering a 65/35 split.  While we are nearing the end of the game, I believe this offer remains fair, considering the inflation's impact on Bob's share.  It allows both of us to get something before the value drops further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is quite skewed due to the inflation, I realize that this is our last chance to get anything at all. With no more time to negotiate, accepting this offer is the only way to avoid getting nothing."
