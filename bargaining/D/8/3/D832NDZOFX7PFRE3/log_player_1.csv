"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you get a small share 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm not getting as much as I would have liked. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting even less.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
