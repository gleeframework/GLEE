"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively fair starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll have to reassess my decision. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 40% share of the remaining $8,000 (which is worth 80% of the initial $10,000). I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's split it roughly 55/45.""
}
```

Considering the continued inflation, I'm aiming for a slightly higher share of the remaining $7,600 (which is 76% of the initial $10,000). Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a good compromise, but I'd rather take 55% myself 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is now offering me the same 45% share I proposed in round 3, but with the money being worth significantly less, I'll have to decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as the value of $4,500 (which is 45% of the remaining $10,000) is still a better deal than walking away and risking getting nothing."
