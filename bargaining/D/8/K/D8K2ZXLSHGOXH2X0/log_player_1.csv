"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  We can both walk away with a decent amount if we agree now. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, so my gain is now 8100 (9000 * 0.9).

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, as I was hoping to get a better deal. However, it's a 50/50 split, and it's still a decent amount. I'll accept this offer to avoid further inflation and the risk of getting even less in subsequent rounds.
