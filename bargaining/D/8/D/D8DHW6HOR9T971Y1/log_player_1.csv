"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90-10 split, with me getting 900,000$ and Bob getting 100,000$. My message to Bob is that this is a fair start, implying that I'm open to negotiating further if he's not satisfied with this proposal."
