"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fairly aggressive offer, but I'm aiming for a quick resolution. I'm confident I can secure a good chunk of the money right from the start, even with the inflation factor against me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even with the inflation affecting him.  I'm willing to take a risk and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I need to balance that with the risk of him rejecting again and potentially forcing me into a worse position in the next round."
