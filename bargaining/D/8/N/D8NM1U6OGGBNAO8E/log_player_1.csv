Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take 9000$ and give 1000$ to Bob.  This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation that will be affecting us both in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I propose to take 8000$ and give 2000$ to Bob.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer and inflation is starting to hit him harder, this is a more equitable distribution."
