Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  We'll see how this goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable than my initial proposal, even accounting for inflation.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can secure a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer, aiming for a more balanced split.  I'll keep the same proportions as his offer, but adjust for the inflation we've both experienced. This should hopefully be more enticing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though this is a much lower gain than what I was aiming for, it's important to consider the impact of inflation. Bob's offer, while less than ideal, represents a significant gain after considering the devaluation of the money.  It's better to secure this deal than to risk further rounds and potential losses due to inflation."
