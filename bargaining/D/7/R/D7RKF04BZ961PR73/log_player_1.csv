Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars.  I figure this is a fair starting point, considering I'm taking a bigger risk with the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
