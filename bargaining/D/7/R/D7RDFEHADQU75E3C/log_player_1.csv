"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly, considering the inflation affecting both of us. Let's start with a slight advantage for me this round, and we can see how the inflation plays out in the future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
