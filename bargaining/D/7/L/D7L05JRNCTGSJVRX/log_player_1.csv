"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, seems fair""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 30%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's see if you'll accept it 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual values are:
My gain: $400,000 * 0.8 = $320,000
Bob's gain: $600,000 * 0.95 = $570,000

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet. I want to see if I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Will you accept a 55:45 split?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming to take a slightly larger share. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's see if you'll accept it this time 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual values are:
My gain: $480,000 * 0.516 (0.8 * 0.64) = $246,848
Bob's gain: $520,000 * 0.855 (0.95 * 0.9) = $445,260

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

This offer seems reasonable, and I'm willing to accept it."
