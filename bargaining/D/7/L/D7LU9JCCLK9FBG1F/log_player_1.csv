"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm offering Bob a significant portion of the money upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me. I'd rather not accept a 50-50 split, considering I'm not losing any value due to inflation. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was a 50-50 split, I'll try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth 20% less for him. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 48.8% less for Bob, his offer is actually a 45-55 split, which is a significant concession on his part. Considering the value of the money is still the same for me, I think this is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
