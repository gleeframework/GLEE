"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, I'll take a bit more this time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was too generous, was I?

I'll think carefully about this offer...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 70% of the remaining money. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 40% of its original value now, due to the 20% inflation twice. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm trying to strike a balance between getting a fair share and not giving up too much to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now!

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, hoping that I'm getting the best deal I can at this point."
