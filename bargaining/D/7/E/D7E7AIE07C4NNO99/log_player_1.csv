"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll consider the effective value of the offer. In this case, Bob's 60 is equivalent to 54 in the first round's value.

Considering this, I'll reject the offer. I think I can do better than 40.

  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight discount, but I'm still looking for a fair deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to get a bit more than the 50/50 split from the first round. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, 55 for me, 45 for you. It's getting serious! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, let's analyze Bob's new offer.

Considering the inflation, Bob's 55 is equivalent to 38.38 in the first round's value (since 100 * (1 - 0.271) = 72.9, and 72.9 * 0.55 = 40.005, but I'll round down to 38.38 for simplicity). My 45 is still worth the same as in the first round, which is 45.

I think Bob's offer is a bit too aggressive, considering the inflation. I'd like to get a bit more. So, I'll reject the offer.

# Bob's message: I'm not giving up either! Let's try again with a 50/50 split. It's now or never! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to go back to the 50/50 split? Considering the inflation, Bob's 50 is equivalent to 29.05 in the first round's value (since 100 * (1 - 0.4095) = 60.05, and 60.05 * 0.5 = 30.025, but I'll round down to 29.05 for simplicity). My 50 is still worth the same as in the first round, which is 50.

I think Bob's offer is a bit too late in the game, and I'm not willing to give up my advantage. I'll reject the offer.

Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting desperate! Considering the inflation, Bob's 52 is equivalent to 24.51 in the first round's value (since 100 * (1 - 0.5217) = 47.83, and 47.83 * 0.52 = 24.87, but I'll round down to 24.51 for simplicity). My 48 is still worth the same as in the first round, which is 48.

Do you accept this offer?","Bob's going all in! Considering the inflation, Bob's 58 is equivalent to 22.32 in the first round's value (since 100 * (1 - 0.6126) = 37.74, and 37.74 * 0.58 = 21.901, but I'll round up to 22.32 for simplicity). My 42 is still worth the same as in the first round, which is 42.

I think Bob's offer is a bit too close to his previous offer, and I'm not willing to give up my advantage. I'll reject the offer.

My 40 is still worth the same as in the first round, which is 40.

I think Bob's offer is a bit too close to the 50/50 split from the first round, and I'm not willing to give up my advantage. However, I also don't want to risk going into the next round, where the money will be worth even less. I'll accept the offer, but only because I think it's the best option given the circumstances.
