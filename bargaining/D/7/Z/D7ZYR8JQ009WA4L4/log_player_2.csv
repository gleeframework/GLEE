Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, a bit more and we're done 
# Bob gain: 44

**Reasoning:**

Even though the difference is small, time is working against me much faster than it is against Alice. Accepting a deal heavily in her favor this early doesn't make sense strategically. I need to push for a more significant gain on my next turn."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's end this. A fair 50/50 split is the most logical solution.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is heavily impacting my returns. It's time to make a strong stand for an even split. This offer:

* **Emphasizes fairness:**  A 50/50 split is objectively fair, making it harder for Alice to reasonably refuse.
* **Highlights the time pressure:**  By now, Alice should also feel the pressure of the diminishing returns.  

It's a gamble, but the risk of continuing to lowball is becoming greater than the potential reward of a slightly better split later."
