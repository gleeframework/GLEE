Round 2

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I can afford to be a bit more generous. However, I'm not sure I want to give up $5,000, considering the inflation will make it worth 10% less for me.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.
