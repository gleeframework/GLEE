Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's end this game. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Calculate the adjusted value of money for both Alice and Bob due to inflation.
For Alice, the money is worth 5% less in each round. So, in Round 3, the money is worth 0.95^2 = 0.9025 of its original value.
For Bob, the money is worth 10% less in each round. So, in Round 3, the money is worth 0.9^2 = 0.81 of its original value.

### Step 2: Determine the offer that Alice should make to Bob, considering the adjusted values.
Alice wants to maximize her gain while making an offer that Bob might accept. Given the decreasing value of money, she needs to balance her immediate gain with the risk of further devaluation in subsequent rounds.

### Step 3: Formulate the offer in JSON format.
Considering the adjusted values and the need for a balanced offer, Alice decides on a division that reflects the decreasing value of money for both parties while trying to entice Bob to accept.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a reasonable split.""}"
