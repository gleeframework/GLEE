"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiation""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the offer from Bob is equivalent to:

Alice gain: 4000 * 0.9 = 3600
Bob gain: 6000 * 0.9 = 5400

I'll accept Bob's offer, since it's a better deal than my original offer and I'd rather not risk going to the next round with the value of the money decreasing further. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
