"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to take $9,000 and leave Bob with $1,000.  I'm hoping to get most of the money, but I want to be fair enough to give him some incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more money, I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the next round. Taking $4,000 is better than getting nothing if Bob rejects my offer."
