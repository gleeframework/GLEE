"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. We can discuss further if you'd like to adjust.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round. I believe 60/40 is a fair split, considering the inflation we'll both face in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in the second round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I'll need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

In this round, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 40 dollars, which is worth 80% of the original 60 dollars I proposed in the first round (due to 20% inflation). Meanwhile, Bob will get 60 dollars, which is worth 90% of the original 40 dollars he proposed (due to 10% inflation).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the relative value of the money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Given the inflation effects, I'll aim to adjust my proposal to account for the decreasing value of money. Since the money is worth less in each round, I'll aim to get a larger share of the remaining value.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a slightly larger share this round. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: While inflation has hit us both, I believe a 45/55 split is fair considering the previous rounds.  Let's find a compromise to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting harder in each round!

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll need to reassess the proposal. With the 48.8% decrease in the value of my gain, I'll be getting a smaller share of the original 100 dollars. Meanwhile, Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less, which is a smaller decrease.

Given the previous rounds, I think Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. I'll take the 55 dollars and hope that we can both stabilize the value of our gains in future rounds.
