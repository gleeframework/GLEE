"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since I value my gain at the same amount as in the first round, I'm effectively getting 500,000 dollars, which is more than Bob's offer of 400,000 dollars. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a stronger offer this time. Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob due to inflation, I'll aim to give him a slightly larger share to account for that.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a majority of the money for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about this offer carefully. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm effectively getting 500,000 dollars, which is less than Bob's offer of 650,000 dollars. Considering that the money Bob gains is worth significantly less due to inflation, I think I should accept this offer.
