"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, giving me a much smaller share of the money. However, I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I might as well take what I can get. 

I'll accept this offer.
