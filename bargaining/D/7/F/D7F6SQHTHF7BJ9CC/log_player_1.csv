Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's turn the tables! I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting the larger share this time.  This will be a good deal for both of us as the money will be worth less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
