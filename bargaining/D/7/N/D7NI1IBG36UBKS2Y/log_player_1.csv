"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

This is a 50-50 split, which is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll compare the value of the offer to the original 50-50 split. 

The original 50-50 split would be worth $5,000 each, but now it's worth $5,000 for me and $4,000 for Bob. Bob's offer is worth $4,000 for me and $6,000 for Bob, which is a better deal for me than the original 50-50 split. 

I'll accept Bob's offer.
