Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 580000, ""alice_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a mutually beneficial agreement.""}\n\n###"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob. Let's close this deal and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n
I'll accept this offer since the money is losing value quickly, and it seems like a relatively fair deal at this point. Further negotiations might lead to more losses due to inflation."
