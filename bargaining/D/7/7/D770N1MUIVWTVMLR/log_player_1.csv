"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is more fair, considering we both lose value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think a 60-40 split is a bit too skewed towards him, especially since the money is worth less for me. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth even less for me, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 45, but I need a bit more""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping that Bob will accept and we can finally settle on a deal."
