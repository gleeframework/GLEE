Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but the clock is ticking, and inflation is hurting me. This is a strong offer, and it would be wise to accept before the money shrinks further.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a significant hit with each round, and this offer is more than generous.  Accept it now, or we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is getting more desperate. While her offer is better than the previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I believe I can push for a better deal in the next few rounds as the impact of inflation intensifies for Alice."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting dangerous.  We're both losing out because of your greed.  I'm making a final generous offer.  Accept this, or I'm changing my strategy completely. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is bluffing. She's feeling the heat of inflation far more than I am, and her ""final offer"" suggests desperation rather than a change in strategy.  She loses a significant chunk of her potential gains with each passing round. I'm confident I can push for a better deal, even if it means going down to the wire."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Don't play games, Alice.  You've already lost a significant portion of your potential earnings. Take this offer now, or prepare for even less in the following rounds.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, enough is enough!  I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is fair and prevents us both from walking away with nothing. Take it or leave it, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I was pushing for a larger share, Alice's 50/50 offer is now the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only four rounds left, the risk of getting nothing significantly outweighs the potential gain of a slightly larger share. 
* **Alice's Resolve:**  Her tone suggests she's serious about this being her final offer. If I reject this, there's a high chance she'll propose increasingly smaller amounts for me in the remaining rounds, even risking a no-deal outcome. 
* **Guaranteed Payoff:** Accepting a guaranteed $500,000 is better than the uncertainty of the remaining rounds.

This situation highlights the importance of adapting to changing circumstances in negotiations. While my initial strategy aimed for a larger share, accepting a fair split now ensures a positive outcome in the face of increasing risk."
