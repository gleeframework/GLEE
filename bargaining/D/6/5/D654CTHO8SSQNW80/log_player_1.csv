"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can both be rich!""
}
```

I'm offering to take the entire $100, but I'm sure Bob will see the wisdom in accepting this proposal and ending the game early!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split seems reasonable, let's work together. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A fair split, you say? That sounds like a reasonable proposal. But I'm not sure if I'm ready to settle for just 50% yet.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to kick in, and the money is worth 10% less than it was in the second round. I'll try to take advantage of that.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're getting a great deal, Bob! Don't miss out!""
}
```"
