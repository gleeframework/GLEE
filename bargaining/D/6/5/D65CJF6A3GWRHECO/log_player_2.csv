Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise, but a 65/35 split is still too far in your favor. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split.  The longer we wait, the more we both lose.
