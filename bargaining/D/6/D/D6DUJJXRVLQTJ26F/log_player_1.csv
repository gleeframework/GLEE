  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to think!""

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down. I think I deserve the majority of the money. Your turn to think!""

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less for Bob now. I'll consider this new offer.

```

}
