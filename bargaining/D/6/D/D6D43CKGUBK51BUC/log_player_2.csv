"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  This gives you a sizable share while recognizing the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While this is a decent offer, the time pressure and decreasing value of money mean I can likely get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice.  It's a fair deal for both of us, considering the inflation we face.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the attempt at fairness, but the inflation hits you harder than me. I'm willing to compromise, but this deal needs to reflect that reality. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I still think a 50/50 split is fairer, the inflation significantly impacts me more, making Alice's offer the best deal at this point."
