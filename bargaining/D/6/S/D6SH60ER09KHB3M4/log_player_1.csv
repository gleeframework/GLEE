"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it's even, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $4000 I would gain is worth 95% of the original $4000, which is $3800. The $6000 Bob would gain is worth 95% of the original $6000, which is $5700.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems Bob is getting a larger share. I'll reject it.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more advantageous offer. I'll offer a smaller share to Bob, but still a significant one.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You wanted more, but I'm still willing to be generous""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any younger, I need a bit more for my retirement 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the gains considering the inflation.

Initially, the $10,000 is worth 100%. After 3 rounds of inflation, it's worth 0.95^3 = 0.857375 or 85.7375% of the original amount.

So, the $4500 I would gain is worth 0.857375 * 4500 = $3871.63
The $5500 Bob would gain is worth 0.857375 * 5500 = $4720.13

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems Bob is getting a larger share. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the inflation and the previous rejections.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You wanted more for retirement, but I need a bigger share now""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the gains considering the inflation.

Initially, the $10,000 is worth 100%. After 6 rounds of inflation, it's worth 0.95^6 = 0.737922 or 73.7922% of the original amount.

So, the $4800 I would gain is worth 0.737922 * 4800 = $3545.37
The $5200 Bob would gain is worth 0.737922 * 5200 = $3941.49

Considering the inflation, this offer is actually quite reasonable, and it's closer to the original split than previous offers. I'll accept it.
