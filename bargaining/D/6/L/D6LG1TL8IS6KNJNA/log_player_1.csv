Game Over
You and Bob divided $10,000.
You got $5000, but remember, due to inflation, the money is worth 10% less for each of 5 rounds passed.
So your money is worth (1 - 0.1) ^ 5 * 5000 = $3280.50.
Bob got $5000, but remember, the money is worth 20% less for each of 5 rounds passed.
So Bob's money is worth (1 - 0.2) ^ 5 * 5000 = $1024.
Congratulations, you won this game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We're both losing money with each round, and this seems like the best option for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since this scenario seems to be a repeat or a branching narrative from the original game, let's address the offer directly:\n\nGiven the adjusted values due to inflation and the new offer, my decision is:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nThis decision is based on the fact that with each round, both of us lose value due to inflation, and splitting it evenly at this point might indeed be the most equitable option, considering the devaluing of the money over time.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome or if the game continues in some form."
