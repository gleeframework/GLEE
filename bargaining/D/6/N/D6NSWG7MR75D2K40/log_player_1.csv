"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a simple and straightforward way to initiate the negotiation, implying that the proposed division is reasonable and equitable. This opening offer allows room for negotiation while also setting a baseline for further discussions. By starting with a higher amount for myself, I create space for potential concessions in subsequent rounds if needed, considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fairer split. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal, especially since Bob claims this is his final offer but the game structure does not enforce this claim. Given the progressive devaluation of money, it's crucial to balance between achieving a favorable split and minimizing the number of rounds. Accepting this offer would mean I perceive Bob's proposal as the best I can achieve, which, at this stage, I do not."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Meeting in the middle considering inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've increased the amount offered to Bob slightly while still aiming to maximize my gain, considering the impact of inflation on both our gains. The message ""Meeting in the middle considering inflation"" aims to convey a sense of compromise and awareness of the devaluing money, encouraging Bob to accept this offer as a reasonable middle ground between our previous proposals. This approach shows flexibility and an attempt to find a mutually acceptable solution, which might persuade Bob to accept and end the game before further devaluation occurs."
