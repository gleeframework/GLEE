"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it roughly 7:3, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 30%. The message is a gentle suggestion that this is a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly more balanced approach, but still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $400,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $360,000 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with the 60:40 split, but it's a more balanced offer than the first one. I'll consider it.

```

Round 3

```

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take a stronger stance, Bob! You're getting less and less with each round.""
}
```"

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, Alice. You're getting closer, but I still want more 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $480,000 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $360,000 in the first round. However, considering the previous offers, I think I'm getting closer to a fair deal.

I'll consider this offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.
