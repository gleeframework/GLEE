"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk. Accept this and we'll both be rich!

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. That first offer was insulting. I'm feeling generous, so I'll offer you a respectable 400,000.  Take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not taking another insulting offer.  This is a fair split, considering the inflation we've already experienced. Let's finish this before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer in Round 3 is significantly better than her Round 1 offer and is starting to approach a more even split.  Given the rapid inflation, waiting any longer will significantly erode the value of the money, even if I could secure a slightly better deal in a later round.  It's better to take a reasonable offer now than risk getting even less later."
