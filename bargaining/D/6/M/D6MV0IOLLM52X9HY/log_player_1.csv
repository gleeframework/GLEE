"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20 to get it over with?""

```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, which is a pretty standard starting point."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I want a bit more for myself. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think 70 is a bit too low for me. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being reasonable."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Considering the reduced value of the money, 60 is a relatively decent offer, but I'm not sure if I want to settle for 40% for Bob. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
