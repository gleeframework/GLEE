"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. We can discuss further if you want to propose a different split.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for my negotiating skills 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500
* Bob gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500

Since the offer is to meet in the middle, it's a fair proposal, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the better deal. I'll reject this offer for now.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a higher share for taking the risk of negotiating. Let's see if you'll meet me at this compromise.""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a slightly higher amount to Bob, but still keeping a bit more for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I'm getting closer to a fair share, but I'm still not convinced. Can you meet me here? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, so the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 4500 * 0.727 = 3274.7
* Bob gain: 5500 * 0.727 = 3993.5

It seems like Bob is trying to get a higher share, but I'm not sure if it's a good deal for me. I'll reject this offer.
