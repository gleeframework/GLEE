Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is greedy enough to reject a 999,999$ gain!  ðŸ¤‘"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though Bob gets a much bigger share, it's still a much better deal for me than the previous round."
