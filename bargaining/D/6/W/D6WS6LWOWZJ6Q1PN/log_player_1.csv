"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to keep 90 dollars and give Bob 10 dollars. This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I've adjusted my offer to be more reasonable given the inflation.  This offer still gives me the majority, but acknowledges that Bob deserves a larger share than in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While the inflation has reduced my share significantly,  getting 15 dollars is better than nothing at this point, especially given the risk of further inflation if I reject again."
