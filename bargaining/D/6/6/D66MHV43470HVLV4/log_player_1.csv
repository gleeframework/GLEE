"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm hoping this is a fair enough offer that Bob will accept, but I want to start with a strong opening to establish my bargaining power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is insulting. I'm not going to settle for such a small share, especially since I know the money is losing value with each round. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob, as the inflation is starting to kick in and he knows the money is worth less each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the inflation factor. I'm going to hold out for a better deal.  While inflation is hurting both of us, it's hurting Bob more at this point."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer again, but this time by a smaller margin. I'm still holding out for a good share of the money, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still unacceptable.  While inflation is a factor, I'm still in a better position than Bob right now.  I'm going to hold out for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of the shrinking time. We're getting close to the end of the game, and I need to find a compromise that Bob will accept. I'm hoping this offer, offering 60% of the money to me, is enough to convince him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  Even with the significant inflation impacting him, I'm not going to settle for such a small share. I'm going to hold out for a better deal. We're getting close to the end, but I'm not going to give in just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

We're running out of time and I need to find a compromise. This feels like the most equitable solution at this point. It's a 50/50 split, considering the massive inflation, this is a fair outcome for both of us."
