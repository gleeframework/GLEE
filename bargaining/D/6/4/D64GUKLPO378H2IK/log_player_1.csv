"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I've included a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to try to persuade Bob to accept my offer. Since it's the first round, the money is still worth its full value to both of us. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose something more advantageous.  This is a good deal before inflation eats away at the pot. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of a 45-55 split. Although the money is worth less to me now due to inflation, I think I can get a better deal if I propose something else in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want the bigger share""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 58-42 split, with me getting $58 and Bob getting $42. My message to Bob is that I'm willing to compromise, but I still want the bigger share. Since the money is worth even less to me now due to inflation (40% less than the original value), I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer rather than risking another round. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
