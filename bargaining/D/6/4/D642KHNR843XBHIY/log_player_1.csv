"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $100, and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, my gain of 80 in the first round is now worth 80 * 0.9 = 72.

Bob's offer in the second round is 70, which is less than what I would have gotten in the first round. I'll accept this offer.
