**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly playing a waiting game, hoping the pressure of inflation will force me to accept a bad deal. While the offer is getting worse, I'm not desperate yet. Rejecting shows her I'm serious about getting a fair share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Okay, let's be realistic. I'll accept your previous offer of 45/55.  Take it or leave it.""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time to switch tactics. Alice is unlikely to agree to a 50/50 split, and the longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me.  By accepting her previous offer, I show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not budging any further. This puts the pressure back on her â€“ does she risk getting nothing by continuing to be greedy?"
