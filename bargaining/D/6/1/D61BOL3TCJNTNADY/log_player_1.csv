"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split the money evenly, as it's a fair starting point. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. With the inflation rates, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $3,800. Bob's gain of $6,000 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $4,800.

Considering the inflation, I think this offer is actually quite generous from Bob's perspective. I'll decide to reject it and make a counteroffer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of money.

Since the money is worth less now, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the total. I'll propose a 55-45 split, which means I'll get $5,500 and Bob will get $4,500.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I still believe a more even split is the fairest solution. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain of $4,500 is worth 95% * 95% * 95% * 95% * 95% * 95% = 81.38% of the original value, which is approximately $8,143.60.

Bob's gain of $5,500 is worth 80% * 80% * 80% * 80% * 80% * 80% = 40.96% of the original value, which is approximately $4,096.

Considering the values, I think Bob's offer is still a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise and accept the offer.
