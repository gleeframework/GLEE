"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money as time goes on. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's tempting to accept this offer, but it's too early in the game. I'm better off waiting to see what Alice will offer in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a better deal as time goes on and the money loses value faster for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair.  I'm taking a little more this time, but remember, the money is worth less to you with each passing round."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be realistic.  This offer is better than what you'll get if you keep declining. The clock is ticking for both of us, but especially for you. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me.  I've already lost a significant amount due to inflation, and Alice's offer is better than what I'd get if I keep rejecting and the game continues. I'm accepting."
