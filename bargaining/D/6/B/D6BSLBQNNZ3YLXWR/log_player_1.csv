"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $6,000 is now worth $4,800. Bob's offer of $8,000 is now worth $6,400.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
