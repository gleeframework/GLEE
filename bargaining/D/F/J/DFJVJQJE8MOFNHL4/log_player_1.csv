"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $100 in a 3:1 ratio, with you receiving $25. I believe this is fair given the decreasing value of money over time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money almost evenly.  Since the value of money is decreasing for you, I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to ensure we both get something worthwhile. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{
