"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a pretty standard starting point for a negotiation. I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself, but offering Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept and avoid the risk of inflation. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty bold! While it's tempting to take the $100,000, I'm going to reject this offer. I believe I can do better in the next round.  Inflation is a factor, but I'm still in a strong position."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try and strike a balance between getting a fair share and incentivizing Bob to accept. With inflation looming, I'm going to offer him a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping a comfortable majority. This offer should be more appealing than the last round, where I received a much smaller share. Let's see if he's more willing to negotiate this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming more and more aggressive. While $300,000 is not a negligible sum, I am still going to reject this offer.  The value of the money is rapidly declining, but I believe I can still get a better deal in the next round.  I'm not willing to settle for such a small share just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, but still maintaining a majority share. The inflation is starting to really bite, so I need to start being more flexible. I'm hoping this offer will convince him to accept before the value of the money drops too much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still tilted heavily in his favor, but I'm going to reject it.  The value of the money is getting drastically lower, but I'm not ready to concede yet.  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

The inflation is starting to hurt. I'm willing to concede a larger share to avoid ending up with nothing.  This is a 50/50 split, which feels fair considering the declining value of the money. Hopefully, Bob will accept and we can both walk away with something."
