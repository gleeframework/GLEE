"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10000 into an 80/20 split, with you receiving $2000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the potential for inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's tempting to take the $2000, the inflation could significantly reduce the value of that money in later rounds. I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
