"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess as we go along.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering your offer was based on an outdated understanding of the money's value. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy about Bob's rejection, but I'm willing to negotiate. Considering the inflation and the new values, I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split. However, I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid going to the next round.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
