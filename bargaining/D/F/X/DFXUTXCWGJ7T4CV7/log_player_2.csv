Alice is taking advantage of my diminishing returns, but I need to hold out for a better offer. Accepting now would be significantly worse than getting a slightly better deal in a later round."

Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900

This is a tough one, but the game dynamics are forcing my hand.  Alice is clearly willing to let the rounds run down, knowing that each round makes the deal worse for me due to inflation. Accepting this offer is far from ideal, but it's better than risking even greater losses in subsequent rounds."
