"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice is proposing to take $5,500 and give Bob $4,500, with a message encouraging Bob to accept the offer and end the game. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that the offer is reasonable and that it's better to accept it rather than risking further rounds and potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, so I propose the same deal, but reversed. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Alice is rejecting Bob's offer, likely because she believes she can get a better deal in the next round or because she's willing to take the risk of further inflation to try and negotiate a more favorable outcome. By rejecting the offer, Alice will get to make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bigger risk, but I still want to close the deal. This is my new offer.""}\n\nIn this new offer, Alice is proposing to take $6,000 and give Bob $4,000, with a message indicating that she's willing to take on more risk due to the decreasing value of the money, but still wants to reach an agreement. The offer reflects her increased assertiveness in the negotiation, considering the impact of inflation on the money's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn this response, Alice is accepting Bob's offer of a 50/50 split, likely because the continuous rejection of offers and the significant decrease in the money's value due to inflation (48.8% less than in the first round) have made this option more appealing. By accepting this offer, Alice is choosing to end the game and secure her share of the money rather than risking further losses from inflation in potential future rounds."
