"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate further""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the original 100$, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going all the way to 70 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain in this round are:

* My gain: 60 * 0.9 (since my gain is worth 10% less) = 54
* Bob's gain: 40 * 0.8 (since Bob's gain is worth 20% less) = 32

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's better than the initial 30% I was offered. I'll accept this offer.
