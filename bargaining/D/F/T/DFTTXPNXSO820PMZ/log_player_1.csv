"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor. It's a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 80-20 is a more reasonable starting point. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 80-20 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll aim for a more aggressive split to compensate for the decrease in value.

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. Let's try 45-55 in my favor. It's still a decent split, considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing that I get $4,500 and Bob gets $5,500. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much more. 70-30 is my final offer. It's still a good compromise considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me! With the money I gain being worth 48.8% less, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still quite aggressive, but I'll have to consider it.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point. I'll take $3,000 and hope that it's enough to make it worth my while."
