"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90% to 10% split in my favor, which means I'll get $900,000 and Bob will get $100,000. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so the actual amount I'd get is 0.8 x 900,000 = 720,000.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'd get $500,000, which is more than my adjusted potential gain of $720,000. I'll accept Bob's offer.
