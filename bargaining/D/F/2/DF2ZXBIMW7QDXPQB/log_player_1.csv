"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of 500,000 is now worth 90% of its original value due to inflation, so I'll have to consider that when making my decision.

I'll reject this offer because it's not a significant improvement from my initial offer, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is a slight improvement from my initial offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! With my gain of 400,000 being worth only 72.9% of its original value, I'm not thrilled about this offer.

However, considering the trend of Bob's offers, it seems like he's trying to get a larger share. I'll accept this offer to avoid further rounds and get some money.
