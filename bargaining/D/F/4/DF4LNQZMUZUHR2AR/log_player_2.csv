Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. I want a bigger share of the money, and I'm willing to risk it for a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 75, ""alice_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to propose a 75/25 split in my favor.  I believe this is a fair offer considering I'm taking the risk of rejection.  If Alice rejects, she'll have to make a better offer to me in the next round, otherwise, she risks getting nothing in the later rounds."
