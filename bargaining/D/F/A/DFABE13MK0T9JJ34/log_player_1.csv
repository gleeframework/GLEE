"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose that I take $6000, and Bob takes $4000. This is a fair starting point, giving me a slight advantage considering the inflation rates. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting, I still believe I can get a better deal. The inflation is working in my favor, and I'm confident I can negotiate a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I propose a 50/50 split.  The inflation has made the money worth less, and I think a fair split is the best way to ensure a quick and amicable resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I accept Bob's offer. While inflation has significantly eroded the value of the money, this offer is still more than I would have received if I had accepted the 50/50 split in the previous round. It's time to end this negotiation and secure my share."
