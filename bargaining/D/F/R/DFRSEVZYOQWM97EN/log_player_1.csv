"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40 and keep 60. Let's see if you like it.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount to start with, and we can see how the game unfolds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your initial offer, but I think I deserve a bit more for being the one to make the next offer. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll be getting 48 (60 * 0.8) and Bob will be getting 50.

I don't think I should accept this offer, since I'm getting less than I proposed initially. I'll reject it and make a new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, I'll be getting 38.4 (48 * 0.8) and Bob will be getting 50.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve a bit more this time. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than before, while still being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll be getting 32.8 (60 * 0.544) and Bob will be getting 55.

Considering the decreasing value of money, I think this offer is relatively reasonable. I'll accept it.
