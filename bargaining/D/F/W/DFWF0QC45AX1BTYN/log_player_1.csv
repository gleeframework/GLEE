"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is 20$. I'm keeping 80% for myself, which is 80$. My message is a straightforward one, hoping Bob will see the fairness in the split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less after the first round, my 80$ is now worth 64$. Considering Bob's new offer, I'm now looking at 40$ for me and 60$ for Bob.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
