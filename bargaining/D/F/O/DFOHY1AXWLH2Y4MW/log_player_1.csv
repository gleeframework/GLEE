"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a fair share of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but you'll still get a decent chunk! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, I'll need to be more careful with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2. I'd rather wait for a better proposal, especially since I'll get less value out of the money in subsequent rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""I'll take the majority, but I'm willing to give you a small share!""
}
```

I'm proposing an 80/20 split, hoping to get the majority of the reduced value, but still leaving Bob with a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not giving up too much! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth only 51.2% of its original value, I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 4. It's not a bad deal, but I'm not sure if I should settle for it.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 4.
