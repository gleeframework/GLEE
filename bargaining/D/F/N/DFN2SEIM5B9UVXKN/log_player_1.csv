"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000 and leave 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4000. Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $4500.

I'll reject this offer since I'd be getting less than I would have in the first round. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new proposal. Since my gain is worth 80% of its original value from the first round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation effect.

My gain of $5800 is worth 58.8% of its original value, which is approximately $5800 * 0.588 = $3405.6.

Bob's gain of $4200 is worth 72.9% of its original value, which is approximately $4200 * 0.729 = $3056.2.

Considering the values, I'll accept this offer.
