"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you $4000 to get the ball rolling.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6000 and Bob $4000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair split to get the game started!"

# Bob's message: I'll match your fairness proposal, but with a slight tweak. I'll give you 5000 and take 5000 myself. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm not quite ready to settle for a 50-50 split just yet. I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for the next round and see if I can do better."

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800
