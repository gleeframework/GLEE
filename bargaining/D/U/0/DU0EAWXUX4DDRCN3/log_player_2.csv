"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's good to start by understanding the stakes.  While Alice's offer is fair on the surface, it's important to remember that the value of the money decreases over time for both of us.  Rejecting the offer gives me a chance to make a counterproposal and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  We both get the same amount and avoid the risk of inflation diminishing the value of our share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, a bit more for me seems fair 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is tempting, but I'm still holding out for a more even split. The inflation rate is only 5% per round for Alice, and I'm not losing any value. It's worth seeing if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share than your previous offer.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the substantial inflation impact, I believe this is fair 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is now closer to her initial proposal from Round 1. While her share is still larger,  the inflation is starting to impact her significantly. Accepting this offer is the best strategy at this point, given the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower payout for me due to inflation."
