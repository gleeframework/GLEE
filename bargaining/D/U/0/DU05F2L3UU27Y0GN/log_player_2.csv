Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging any further. This is my final offer.  Accept it and we both walk away with something, or we both risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation working against her.  While her offer isn't terrible, I'm betting she'll be more desperate in the next round and willing to concede even more. My offers are reasonable, and the longer she waits, the less appealing they will become to her."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is it. I'm tired of this game. Let's split it evenly and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally cracking under the pressure of the inflation. While I was hoping for a slightly better deal, a 50/50 split is a good outcome considering the alternative is getting nothing if we continue to play chicken."
