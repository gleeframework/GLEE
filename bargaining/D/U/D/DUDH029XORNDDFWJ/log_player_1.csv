"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets 20%, which is $2,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'm actually getting $7,000 (80% of $8,000). And Bob's offer is that I get $5,000 and he gets $5,000.

I think I can do better than this. I'll reject the offer and make a new one.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I want a bit more. Let's try again!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I'm getting a bit shortchanged 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'm actually getting $4,800 (60% of $8,000) in this round. Bob's offer is that I get $4,000 and he gets $6,000.

I'm not thrilled about the idea of giving up more, but I don't want to risk going into negative territory. I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get at this point.
