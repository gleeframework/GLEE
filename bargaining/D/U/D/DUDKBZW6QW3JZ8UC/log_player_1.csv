"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing. In this round, the total value of the money is $9,500 ($10,000 x 0.95).

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll consider it. Since Bob's offer is equal, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the remaining $9,500, and Bob gets the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly! 

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

Total value of money: $9,500 x 0.95 x 0.95 = $8,522.50

My gain would be $8,522.50 x 0.857 (14.26% less than the first round) = $7,286.25

Bob's gain would be $8,522.50 x 0.516 (48.8% less than the first round) = $4,379.32

Considering the decreasing value of money, I think Bob's offer is a good one. I'll accept it.
