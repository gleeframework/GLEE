"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll have to accept a smaller amount due to inflation. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can do better than a 50-50 split, especially considering the inflation effect on my end. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You said fair split, but I think I deserve a bit more. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is a slight increase from his previous offer, but I'm still trying to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are catching up with me! In Round 4, I'll have to accept a smaller amount. Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, although it's not ideal, it's a better deal than what I could get in future rounds, considering the inflation. I'll take the $5,200 and hope it's enough to make it worthwhile."
