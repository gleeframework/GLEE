"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80, you take 20. We can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and I'll take the remaining 80%. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share, and we can avoid any potential losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Bob's offer of splitting it evenly is tempting, but I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it evenly is the best idea. I'll make a new offer: 60 for me, 40 for you.""
}
```

I'm aiming to take a slightly larger share, considering the reduced value of money due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 54,
  ""bob_gain"": 46,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. 54 for me, 46 for you.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount considering the decreasing value of money."
