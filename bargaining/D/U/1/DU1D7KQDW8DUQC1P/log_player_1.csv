"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll need to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me a relatively small amount, I'll decide to reject his offer and try to negotiate for more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a more balanced offer this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}
```

This way, I'll get a decent amount, but still leave room for Bob to negotiate further. Let's see if he accepts!"
