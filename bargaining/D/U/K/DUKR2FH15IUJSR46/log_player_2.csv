Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to make sure I get something reasonable too. Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still not in Bob's best interest.  Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to Bob. He needs to push for a better deal sooner rather than later.
* **Future Rounds:**  Bob will be able to propose again soon, and he can use Alice's increasing offer as leverage to secure a larger share in the next round or two.
* **Target:** Bob should be aiming for at least a 60/40 split in his favor, if not better, to compensate for the impact of inflation."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 620000,
""alice_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a fairer split. However, we need to factor in the time pressure. 62/38 is my final offer. Let's close this deal and avoid losing more to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** Bob is now conveying a sense of urgency and firmness with the ""final offer"" statement. This might push Alice to accept a deal that's slightly less favorable than her ideal outcome.
* **Slight Concession:**  Bob is offering a tiny bit more than his previous offer (60/40), showing a willingness to compromise, but only slightly. 
* **Inflation Emphasis:** By emphasizing the inflation factor again, Bob reinforces the need for Alice to make a decision quickly."
