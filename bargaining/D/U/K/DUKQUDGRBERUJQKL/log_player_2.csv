"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
Since I am Bob, I am more likely to benefit from rejecting the offer and proposing a different split. I know that Alice's money loses value more quickly, so I can take advantage of that in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, but I'll take the bigger share this round.  You'll get your chance to propose next.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more this time, but still a good deal for you! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd like to keep pushing for a better deal, the inflation is really hitting Alice harder than me.  It's likely her offers will get worse from here, and I'm guaranteed a decent amount with this offer."
