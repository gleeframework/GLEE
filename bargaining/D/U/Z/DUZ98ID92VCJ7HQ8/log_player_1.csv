Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a very small amount, hoping he'll accept and I'll get the majority of the money.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's a fair offer, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing in the next round."
