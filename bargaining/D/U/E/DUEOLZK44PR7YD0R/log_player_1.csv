"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $6000 and Bob getting $4000. I think this is a reasonable and fair division, considering we're both equal players in this game. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" conveys my intention to find a mutually acceptable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We both get more that way. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the split is even, the amount I would receive ($5000) is less than what I offered myself in the first round ($6000). Considering the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm offering a 54-46 split, with me getting $5400 and Bob getting $4600. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's even split proposal. Considering the inflation, I'm willing to adjust my expectations, but I still believe I should get a slightly larger share. The message ""Meet in the middle"" conveys my intention to find a mutually acceptable solution."
