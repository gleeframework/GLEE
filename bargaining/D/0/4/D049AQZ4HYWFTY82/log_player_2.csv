"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point.  Let's see what you think! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This offer is not fair, especially considering the inflation. I will see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation in the next rounds. Let's see if we can agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a reasonable share too. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is better than the chance of getting nothing in the later rounds due to inflation."
