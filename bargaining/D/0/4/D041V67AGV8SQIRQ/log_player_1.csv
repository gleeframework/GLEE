"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500,000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500,000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 50/50 to start, Bob. Your turn!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have less, I'll take more this time! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to be careful about inflation. Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll need to take that into account when evaluating the offer.

In the first round, Bob's gain was 500,000, which is worth 100% of the original amount. In the second round, his gain is 600,000, which is 120% of the original amount (10% more than the original 500,000). This means that Bob's gain is worth 90% of the original amount (100% - 10% due to inflation).

So, if Bob's gain is 600,000, it's actually worth 600,000 / 0.9 = 666,667 in the original amount.

Similarly, my gain of 400,000 is worth 400,000 / 0.9 = 444,444 in the original amount.

Considering this, the effective split is:

Alice gain: 444,444
Bob gain: 555,556

I'll reject this offer, since I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550,000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450,000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still willing to compromise. Your turn!""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'm taking more this time! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, my gain of 450,000 is still worth 450,000 in the original amount.

However, Bob's gain of 550,000 is worth less than in the first round due to inflation. In the first round, Bob's gain was 500,000, which is worth 100% of the original amount. In the fourth round, his gain is 550,000, which is 109.9% of the original amount (10% more than the original 500,000). This means that Bob's gain is worth 91% of the original amount (100% - 9% due to inflation).

So, if Bob's gain is 550,000, it's actually worth 550,000 / 0.91 = 604,44 in the original amount.

The effective split is:

Alice gain: 450,000
Bob gain: 604,444

I'll reject this offer, since I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for round 5:
