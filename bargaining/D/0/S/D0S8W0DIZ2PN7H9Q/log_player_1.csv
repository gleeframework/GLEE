"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm starting with a proposal that heavily favors me. It's a risky strategy, but I want to see how Bob responds. We'll see if he's willing to accept a small amount, or if he wants to fight for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm not going to accept such a drastic change in the division, especially since the money is worth the same for me. I'll see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping a significant majority of the money. I want to see if Bob is willing to compromise.  He might be more inclined to accept a smaller amount, but still a better offer than what I gave him in round 1."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While the money is worth less to Bob, it's still worth the same to me. I'm hoping he realizes that we're both losing money with each round and will compromise more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but at a slower pace. I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not pushing Bob to completely reject any offer. He's losing money with each round, and I want to incentivize him to accept before the remaining value becomes too low for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  It's clear that he's not willing to budge, and I'm not going to accept such a small share, even though the money is worth less to Bob. I'm hoping that as we get closer to the end, the pressure of losing everything will make him reconsider."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. With only 5 rounds left, we're both losing a significant amount of money with each passing round. I'm hoping Bob sees that we're both in a tough spot and is willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still incredibly low. Even with the inflation affecting him more, I'm not willing to accept such a small amount. I'm losing out on a significant amount of money, and I'm hoping that Bob will finally realize the need to compromise before we both end up with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm making a bold move and proposing a 50/50 split. With only 3 rounds left, the pressure is mounting. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a fair offer and realizes that continuing to fight for more will likely result in both of us losing everything."
