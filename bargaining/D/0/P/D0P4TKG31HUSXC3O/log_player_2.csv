"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice proposes next. I'm not happy with only getting 10% of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more equitable split would be 55/45. Let's get this done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. 50/50 seems like the fairest option at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's getting late and the 50/50 split is a fair compromise. I'll take it."
