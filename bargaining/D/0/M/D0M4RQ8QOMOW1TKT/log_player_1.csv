Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 70-30 is a fair deal now. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

``` 
While I'd prefer more, the inflation is really hurting my gains. It's better to accept this offer than risk losing even more in the next round."
