"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more now so you are incentivized to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While it's tempting to get some money now,  I want to see if I can get a better deal later on. The inflation will hurt Alice more than me, so I might be able to negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation.  We both get something good, and it's still more than your initial offer.  Let's end this quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  The inflation is hurting us both.  Let's be reasonable and end this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer my initial offer, it seems Alice is determined to end this quickly. The inflation is definitely a factor, and I'm not confident I'll get a better deal in the next round.  I'll accept this offer."
