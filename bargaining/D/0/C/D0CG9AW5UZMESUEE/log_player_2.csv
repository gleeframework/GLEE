Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a small hit from my previous offer, but it's clear we need to settle this soon. This is reasonable considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100
