"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 30%. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a relatively equal split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, let's try 60-40 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, and I think I can do better. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55-45?""}

I'm adjusting my offer to try to find a more balanced split. I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, 50-50, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think Bob has finally made a reasonable offer! I'm willing to accept the 50-50 split, as it's a fair and equal division of the money. I'm not willing to risk going to more rounds and potentially losing more value due to inflation."
