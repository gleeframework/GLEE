"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm offering you 40% of the money, but we can negotiate further. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know my decision and I'll wait for her next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll try to take that into account.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this offer to Alice. I'm looking forward to her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. Inflation is hitting us both hard, so it's fair to meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think this is a fair offer, considering the inflation. Meeting in the middle makes sense, and I don't want to risk losing more value in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know I accept her offer. The game is over."
