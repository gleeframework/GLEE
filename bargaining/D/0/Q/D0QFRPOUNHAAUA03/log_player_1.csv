"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I might prefer a larger share, it's strategically smart to accept. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The money is losing value faster for me than for Bob. Each round that passes makes my share worth less.
* **Equal Split:** This is a fair offer, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better one in the next round.
* **Risk of Rejection:**  If I reject, Bob might offer me a smaller share next round, or even worse, we might keep rejecting until the money is worth very little.

Accepting the offer guarantees me a sizable amount of money, even with the reduced value."
