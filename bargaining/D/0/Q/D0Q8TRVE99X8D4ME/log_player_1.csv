"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a friendly note!"

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor, I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm not willing to give up more than 40% of the total amount, so I'll wait for a better offer."

# Alice gain: 5800
