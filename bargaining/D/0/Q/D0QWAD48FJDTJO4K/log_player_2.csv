**Reasoning:** Time is starting to press, but Alice is still trying to hold onto a significant advantage.  With each round, my position weakens considerably due to inflation, while hers remains the same. I'm hoping that by continuing to reject her offers, she'll get more nervous and offer a larger share to avoid getting nothing."
