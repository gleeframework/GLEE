"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, 60/40 in my favor. I think that's a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 10% inflation rate for me is a significant concern, but I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a reasonable split.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the 10% inflation rate for me and the 5% inflation rate for Alice. I believe this offer is more balanced, given the decreasing value of the money for both of us. I'm hoping Alice will accept this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  I'll take a slight cut to 5250, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think Alice's offer is reasonable. Meeting in the middle and accepting a slight compromise is better than risking further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds. I'll accept this offer to secure a decent share of the $10,000."
