"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

This is a relatively equal split, giving us both $400,000 each. I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in this proposal and accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve more for my negotiating skills! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more for his negotiating skills, does he?

I'm not impressed by his negotiating skills if he's just going to try to take advantage of me in the first two rounds! I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for a counteroffer!

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You think you're worth 700k? I'm not buying it. Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous split, but still trying to keep the upper hand. Let's see if Bob will meet me in the middle!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. Time to make a serious offer! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's trying to squeeze me dry!

I'm not desperate, but I am getting a bit concerned that we're running out of time. However, I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me at this stage. I'll reject his offer and try to come up with something better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting 800k, Bob. I'm not afraid to walk away.""
}
```

I'm making a bold move, taking a larger share of the pie. Let's see if Bob will blink first!"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really pushing your luck, Alice. Don't think you can take me for a ride! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's getting aggressive!

I'm not going to let him bully me into a terrible deal. $100,000 is an insult, and I'm not going to accept it. I'll reject his offer and try to come up with something better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to take a firmer stance!

Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting 900k, Bob. It's time to make a real compromise.""
}
```

I'm making a strong move, taking 90% of the pie. Let's see if Bob will finally accept a reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really lowballing me now, Alice. I'm not going to get taken advantage of! 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is ridiculous! $50,000 is an insult, and I'm not going to accept it. I'd rather walk away with nothing than accept such a tiny share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to get ruthless!

{
  ""alice_gain"": 999000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting a better deal than this, Bob. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm making a bold move, offering Bob a tiny share of the pie. Let's see if he'll accept it or try to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Fine, I'll meet you halfway. But don't think this is the end of it! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Finally, a reasonable offer from Bob!

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a 50/50 split, which is a fair compromise. I'm not going to push my luck any further, and I'd rather take half of the pie than risk getting nothing.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
