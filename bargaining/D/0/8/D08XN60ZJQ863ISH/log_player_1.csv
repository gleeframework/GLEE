"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to get a bigger share, but I'll give you a small chance to get something. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to adjust my calculation for the 5% inflation. Since the initial amount was $100, I'll calculate my gain as 20 * (100 / (100 * 0.95)) = 21.05 (approximately). 

However, I'll stick to the original numbers for simplicity.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too greedy, Bob. I'm not ready to give up that much yet.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a bigger share, but I still want a fair deal.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still trying to get a bigger share, but I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate my gain for this round, considering the 14.26% inflation. The initial amount was $100, so my gain would be 30 * (100 / (100 * 0.8587)) â‰ˆ 34.84.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there yet, Bob. I'm still hoping for a more balanced split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll adjust my offer to take into account the cumulative inflation.

Since the initial amount was $100, and there was 14.26% inflation in the previous round, the effective amount is 100 * (1 - 0.1426) = 85.74. Now, considering another 5% inflation, the effective amount for this round is 85.74 * 0.95 = 81.51.

I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
