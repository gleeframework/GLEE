"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting 70 dollars and Bob getting 30 dollars. This is a relatively generous offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is fair.  Let's be reasonable and avoid any further rounds of negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the actual amounts I would gain are:

* 70 dollars (initial offer) * 0.95 (1 - 0.05 inflation) = 66.5 dollars
* 50 dollars (Bob's offer) * 0.8 (1 - 0.2 inflation) = 40 dollars

Considering the adjusted amounts, I think Bob's 50/50 split is a reasonable offer. I'll accept it.
