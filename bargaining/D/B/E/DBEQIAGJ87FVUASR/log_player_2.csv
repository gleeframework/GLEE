Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation and is getting less desperate.  While her offers are slowly getting better, I'm still in a strong position to hold out for a larger share."

""alice_gain"": 250000,
""message"": ""The deal's getting sweeter for you, Alice, but I need to see more movement.  75/25 is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure by stating this is my final offer. While it's a bluff, it might be enough to get Alice to accept a less favorable deal, especially with the inflation working against her."

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation! This is more than fair, let's close the deal before it's too late for both of us! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at a 60/40 split in her favor. While not ideal, the inflation is starting to significantly impact her potential gains. It's becoming riskier to wait for a better offer, as she might not be willing to go much higher. It's better to take a decent share now than risk getting nothing later."
