"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 6,000 and Bob gets 4,000."

# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'll consider Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split, where I get 5,000 and Bob gets 5,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to move forward with this agreement."
