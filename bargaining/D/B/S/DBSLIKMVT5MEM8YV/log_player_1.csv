"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't do much better than this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I want to give you a 60/40 split, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation.""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best deal, especially considering the effects of inflation. I'd like to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway between 50/50 and 60/40. Let's try this compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, hoping Bob will accept this middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I'm being generous enough. You can try to do better if you want! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the effects of inflation are really adding up!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 30/70 split, especially since the money is worth even less now. I think I can do better than this.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I think I can negotiate a better deal. I'll have to think carefully about my next move, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 5, the money is worth even less due to inflation. I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal than your last offer. This is my final compromise, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 36/64 split, trying to meet Bob halfway while still getting a decent share for myself. This is my last offer, so I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
