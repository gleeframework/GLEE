"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get the negotiations started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the ball rolling and see if Bob is willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $30 is worth 95% of the original $50 from the first round, which is $47.50. So, I'd be getting a relatively small share of the total amount.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the large disparity in our shares. I'd like to propose a more balanced split.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 90.25% of the original amount from the first round (95% of 95% of $50). I'll make a new offer that's a bit more aggressive, but still reasonable.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight edge, but I need a decent share to make it worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit impatient, so I'll give you a very small share, but I'm not budging much. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating away at my potential gain! Considering the inflation, my gain of $20 is worth 40.00% of the original $50 from the first round, which is $20. I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm getting desperate to make a deal.

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer and decide to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take the $20, but I hope we can do better next time.""
}
```"
