Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting you hard, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is working heavily against me. While Alice's offer is getting proportionally better, I need to hold out for a larger share while it's still somewhat worthwhile. Accepting now would mean a significant loss compared to the potential gains in earlier rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""This is a serious offer. Inflation is hurting me, but I'm willing to settle if you are.""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Time is becoming a factor. While I rejected Alice's previous offer, I need to start making more appealing concessions. This offer is still in my favor, but recognizes the time pressure and aims for a resolution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming critical. While this offer isn't ideal, accepting now guarantees me something rather than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds.  Alice knows time is on her side, and future offers are unlikely to be in my favor."
