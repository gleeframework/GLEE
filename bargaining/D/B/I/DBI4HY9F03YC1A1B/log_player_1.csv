Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob.  I want to secure a deal early and avoid the risk of inflation hitting my share too hard.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly less generous than my initial proposal, the inflation rates mean it's in my best interest to accept.  My share is worth less with each round, and Bob's offer ensures I get a decent amount.  It's time to cash out!"
