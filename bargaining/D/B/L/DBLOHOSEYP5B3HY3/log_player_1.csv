Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can be fair to both of us. This way, you'll get a slightly smaller share, but you'll still end up with more money in the long run. We can avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
