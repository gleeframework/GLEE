Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think 60-40 is a more reasonable split, considering I'm taking a bigger hit from inflation.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer benefits us both, especially considering the increasing inflation. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm still not satisfied with the offer, and I think I can negotiate a better deal. The inflation is affecting me more, so I'll try to get a bigger share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is hitting me harder, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think I deserve a bigger share.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  It's clear the inflation is making this drag on pointless. Let's end this now and both get something worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think accepting this offer is the best decision. Prolonging the game would only lead to further devaluation of the money for me, and Alice's offer seems reasonable at this point. It's time to end the game and take what I can get."
