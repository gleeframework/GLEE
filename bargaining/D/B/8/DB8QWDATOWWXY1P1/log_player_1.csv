"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leave Bob with 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more generous since the money is worth less now.
