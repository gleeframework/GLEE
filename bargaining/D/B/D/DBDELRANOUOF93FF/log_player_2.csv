"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair division. Take 10$, I'll take 90$. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. How about we split it 95/5? This is a fair deal, I'm sure you'll agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking with my original offer. It's still fair, and inflation doesn't change that. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While my gain is now significantly less due to inflation, it's still better than getting nothing if we continue to reject each other's offers.  It's important to consider the long-term consequences of continually rejecting offers."
