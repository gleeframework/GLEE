"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $6000, you get $4000. It's in our best interest to settle this quickly before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I think I can do better than that. It's early in the game, and we haven't seen how much inflation will impact things.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think we can both get more if we keep negotiating. I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, but let's see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting us both. I'm taking a hit with this offer, but $5500 is the best you'll get. Agree now, or it'll only get worse for you next round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Inflation is hitting hard, and I don't want to risk getting less next round. I'll accept Alice's offer."
