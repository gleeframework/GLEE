"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as I am taking a slightly larger share due to the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, the inflation has significantly impacted my potential gains from future rounds. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the changing value of money."
