Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm taking a big chunk for myself, but I'm willing to give him a little something to hopefully get this over with quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation makes this a decent deal.  It's a 50/50 split and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the future, especially with inflation."
