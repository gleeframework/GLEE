"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation, it's better for both of us to agree now.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $40 and keep $60 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to accept the offer, considering the inflation rate that affects Bob more than me. It's a strategic start to the negotiation, aiming to find a mutually agreeable division early on.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation will only get worse for me. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer of a 55/45 split. Given that the inflation affects Bob more than me, I'm in a slightly advantageous position as the rounds progress. I'm hoping to leverage this to get a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round! Please respond with my next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the growing inflation impact on your end, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but I still believe I deserve a bit more.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to increase my offer to Bob slightly, acknowledging the increasing impact of inflation on his end. However, I'm still aiming to maximize my gain, given that the inflation doesn't affect me. The message is a mix of empathy and assertiveness, trying to find a balance that Bob might accept.\n\n###\n\nYour turn! Please respond with Bob's decision."
