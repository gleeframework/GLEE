"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money ($800,000) and Bob gets 20% ($200,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain would be $400,000 instead of $800,000, and Bob's gain would be $600,000 instead of $1,200,000.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but it's still a decent split. I'll decide to reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the money ($700,000) and Bob gets 30% ($300,000)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a reasonable compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less, my gain would be $550,000 instead of $2,000,000 (if we were still at the original amount).

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for Round 4.
