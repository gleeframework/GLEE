"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can reassess if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm open to negotiating further if Bob is not satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share to start, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept a slightly smaller share due to the inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""

I'll take the 4000$."
