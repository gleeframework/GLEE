"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

I'm offering to give you $40 and keep $60 for myself. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's only fair we split the money evenly. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to re-evaluate the offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual amounts as follows:

My gain: $40 * 0.8 = $32
Bob's gain: $60 * 0.9 = $54

Considering the reduced values, I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2 for me, and 10% less than in Round 2 for Bob. I'll calculate the reduced values:

My gain: $32 * 0.8 = $25.6
Bob's gain: $54 * 0.9 = $48.6

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need some security""
}
```

I'm offering you $70 and keeping $30 for myself. The message is a bit more cautious, trying to balance the fairness with my own interests."
