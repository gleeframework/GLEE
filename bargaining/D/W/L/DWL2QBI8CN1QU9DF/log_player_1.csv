"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This seems like a fair starting point, given that the money will decrease in value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 927272.73 
# Bob gain: 72727.27 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
