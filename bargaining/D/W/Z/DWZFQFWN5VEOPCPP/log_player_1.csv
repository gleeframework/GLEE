"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount, $800,000, and Bob gets 20%, $200,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Not bad, but I can do better than 4:1. How about a 3:1 split? 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 3:1 split, but I'll consider it.

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, 3:2 split, a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing a 3:2 split, with me getting 60% of the total amount, $600,000, and Bob getting 40%, $400,000. I think this is a more reasonable compromise than the 4:1 and 3:1 splits we've seen so far."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The bonus is tempting, but I'm not convinced that the 4:1 split is fair.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. The bonus is nice, but I think I can do better than a 4:1 split."

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, 5:4 split, and I'll throw in a bonus of 50,000 for you""}

I'm proposing a 5:4 split, with me getting 55% of the total amount, $550,000, and Bob getting 45%, $450,000. I'm also throwing in a bonus of $50,000 to sweeten the deal. I hope Bob will consider this offer more favorably."

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The desperation is palpable!

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. The 6:3 split is still not ideal, but I think it's the best I can get at this point. I'll take the $450,000 and hope that Bob will hold up his end of the bargain."
