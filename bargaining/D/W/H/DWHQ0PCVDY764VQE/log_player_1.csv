"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still willing to make a fair deal. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $400,000 (10% less than $450,000)
* Bob's gain: $570,000 (5% less than $600,000)

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'll consider it. However, I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a more even split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a more even split. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Let's try to meet in the middle, but I'll give you a slightly larger share this time.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to Bob, hoping he'll accept this proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm willing to make a deal. It's getting late, let's finalize this! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: $300,000 (27.1% less than $450,000)
* Bob's gain: $600,000 (14.26% less than $600,000)

I'm not happy with the uneven split, but I'm getting close to the end of the game. I'll think carefully before making a decision. However, I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a better deal. Can you meet me at 55/45?""
}
```"
