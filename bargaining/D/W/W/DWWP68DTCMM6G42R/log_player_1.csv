I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, but I think it's reasonable enough that Bob will accept it.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to accept that! It's way too unfair. I'll take my chances and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This time, I'm offering a more even split.  I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept, since we're both getting closer to a 50/50 division."
