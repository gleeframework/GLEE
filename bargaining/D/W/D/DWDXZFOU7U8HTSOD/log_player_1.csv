"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This is a relatively fair offer, as it gives Bob a small share while still keeping the majority for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, but I can do better. Even with inflation, I can still get a larger share by rejecting this offer and making my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

This offer still gives Bob a significant share, but it ensures I get a larger portion after inflation. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that will make Bob more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has taken a toll on the money's value, and I'm starting to feel the pressure. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I get something. It's also possible that Bob will become more demanding in future rounds."
