Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the time pressure and inflation. While the deal is getting worse, accepting only $4000 when we started with a potential $5000 is a significant loss. I believe there's still room to negotiate a better outcome, even if it means getting closer to a 45/55 split in the later rounds."
