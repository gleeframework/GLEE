"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but if not, I'm prepared to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While it's tempting to accept, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a significant gain for me, but it's a more reasonable offer than my first proposal. I believe Bob will be more inclined to accept this offer, as the money is losing value with each passing round."
