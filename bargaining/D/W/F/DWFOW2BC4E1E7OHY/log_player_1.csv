"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing to take 60% of the money, which is $6,000, and Bob will receive 40%, which is $4,000. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is an attempt to persuade Bob that this division is reasonable and that prolonging the game will only result in both of us losing value due to inflation. By framing it as a fair split, I'm hoping Bob will see the logic in accepting this proposal early on to avoid the diminishing value of the money in subsequent rounds.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although the split is even, the value of the money for me has already decreased by 20% due to inflation from the first round. This means that the $5,000 I would receive is actually worth less to me than its face value, making the ""even"" split not as even in terms of real value. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round or make an offer that might be more favorable considering the impact of inflation on my earnings.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with my next offer for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll make an offer that slightly adjusts the proportions to try and find a middle ground, while also considering the impact of inflation on my earnings. Given that the value of the money has decreased for me, I'll aim to secure a bit more to compensate for the loss in value.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with Bob's response."
