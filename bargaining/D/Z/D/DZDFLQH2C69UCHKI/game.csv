512000.0,488000.0,I've adjusted our proposal to reflect the inflationary pressures. Let's go with a 51.2:48.8 ratio. This offers a slight compromise that accounts for the diminishing value of money over time.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
50000.0,950000.0,"I'm getting desperate, and the inflation is eating into my potential gain. I'm offering you a tiny share, but I need to prioritize my own survival in this economic downturn.",Bob,6,
