"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate more in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 60 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is equivalent to 54. 

I'm not too thrilled with this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.
