900000.0,100000.0,Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.  We can negotiate further if you prefer.,Alice,1,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, your offer was a bit unbalanced. Let's be more realistic.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects the risk I'm taking by letting the money depreciate further. What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,I'm willing to compromise further. Let's split the money 55/45 in my favor. This is a fairer split considering the inflation we've already faced. I'm open to discussing further if you have any concerns.,Alice,3,
