"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do a bit better than a 60/40 split. Let's go for a 55/45 split.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the new value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 45-55 split. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, and another 10% less than that, it's now worth 90% of the original value. So, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50/50. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which should be a fair deal considering the reduced value of the money."
