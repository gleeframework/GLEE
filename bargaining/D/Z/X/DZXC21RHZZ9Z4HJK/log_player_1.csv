"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the lion's share of the money, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal, considering Bob is trying to take a bigger share. I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the money being worth 95% of its original value after the first round and 90% after the second round, I'll aim for a more balanced split this time.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to bite!

Considering the money is now worth only 85.74% of its original value for me, and Bob is trying to take a huge share, I'll have to think carefully...

But, I'm not sure if I can afford to wait for a better offer. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I might be left with nothing if I reject it and the game goes on.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
