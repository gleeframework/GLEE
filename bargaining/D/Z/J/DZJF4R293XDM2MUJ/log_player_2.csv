"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a compromise. I'm willing to give up some of my gains to avoid further inflation. Let's reach an agreement before we lose even more. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right about the impact of inflation, her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  I'm aiming to secure a larger portion of the money and believe I can get a better deal in subsequent rounds, even with the impact of inflation."
