"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point considering I'll be the one taking the risk of being rejected and having to deal with inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have a larger share, accepting this offer is the best option in this situation.  Inflation means the money I gain is worth significantly less.  If I reject this offer, I risk getting even less in the next round."
