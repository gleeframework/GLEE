"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, but willing to negotiate!""
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. I'm trying to make a good first impression, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is worth $240,000 (80% of $300,000), and Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth $665,000 (95% of $700,000).

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not risk going to the next round, so I'll accept this offer.
