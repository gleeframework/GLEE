"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it still leaves Bob with a small amount, hopefully making him more likely to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though my share is much lower, it's still better than the 5% loss I'd experience if we continue to the next round.  This is a calculated risk, but I think it's the best option given the circumstances."
