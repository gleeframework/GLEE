60.0,40.0,Let's be fair and split the money. I believe this is a generous offer considering the inflation.,Alice,1,

45.0,55.0,"Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. If you don't accept, the money will be worth less for me in the next round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but time is working against us. My previous offer was already generous, and with each round, the value diminishes, especially for you. Let's settle this now and avoid losing out further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"I understand your point about time working against me, but I still believe I deserve a bit more. This offer is slightly more in your favor than my last one, considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting you more than me, and this back-and-forth isn't helping either of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point. Take it or leave it, but the clock is ticking.",Alice,5,
