"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""}

I'm offering Bob $2000, which is a decent chunk of the initial amount, and keeping $8000 for myself. The message is just a friendly greeting to set the tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  50/50 is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about the 50/50 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll think about it carefully.

After some thought, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm hoping to do better than a 50/50 split, so I'll pass on this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50/50 split, I'll try to do better. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about this?""}

I'm offering Bob $3000, which is still a decent amount, but I'm keeping $7000 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to Bob, hinting that I'm willing to compromise but still want to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get closer to a deal.  I'm willing to go up to 4000, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is worth less and less with each round! Okay, let's think about Bob's offer...

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm getting closer to a deal. After some consideration, I've decided to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the $6000 and hope that I can do better in future rounds."
