"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that appeals to fairness. Since there's no inflation in the first round, I can aim for a slightly higher share. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable offer, considering we're just starting the game.\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob and let me know his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I think a 60-40 split is fair, but with me taking the larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, the 4000 dollars I would gain in this round is actually worth less than it would have been in the first round. Since I started with a 60-40 split proposal in my favor and Bob rejected it, I see no reason to accept the same split in his favor, especially with the value of the money decreasing for me.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round where I'll make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the larger share.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the inflation that has reduced the value of the money for me. To compromise and attempt to reach an agreement, I've slightly reduced my share from the initial 60% offer to 58%, while also considering the fact that the money is worth less to me now. The message aims to convey my willingness to find a middle ground while still asserting my initial stance on deserving the larger share.\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I still think my share should reflect the value I bring to this negotiation.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his willingness to give me a little more, the 4500 dollars offered is significantly reduced in value due to inflation, making it worth even less than it appears. Given that we're only in round 4 and I have 8 more rounds to negotiate, I believe there's still room to find a better deal that compensates for the decreasing value of the money on my end.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round where I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the need to counteract the effects of inflation on my share.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'm taking into account the significant reduction in value of the money for me due to inflation. To counteract this and attempt to reach an agreement, I've decided to propose a 55-45 split in my favor, which is slightly more conservative than my previous offers but still reflects the fact that the money is worth less to me. The message aims to convey my awareness of the impact of inflation and my willingness to adjust my expectations accordingly, while also emphasizing the need for a fair share that considers the decreasing value of the money on my end.\n\nPlease relay this offer to Bob.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, so I'm adjusting my expectations. A 55-45 split seems more reasonable now.""}"
