Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly, taking into account the inflation risk. Let's reach a deal before the money loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
