I'm offering Bob a small amount to ensure he accepts, and hopefully, the game ends quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's more than he offered me in the first round, it's still not a good deal. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round when I get to make the offer again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to Bob by 10 dollars.  This is still a good deal for me, as I'm getting a larger share, and it may be enough to convince him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. Even though he's offering me a larger share than in the previous round, the value of his offer is significantly reduced due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going back to my original offer.  The inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me, and this offer is still a good deal for me, while potentially tempting enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is reasonable considering the inflation. It's a significant improvement over his last offer, and the value of my share is still much higher than in the previous rounds. I'll accept this offer."
