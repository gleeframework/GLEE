Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario with a bit of a twist. I'm aiming to get the most money I can, while also taking into account the risk of Bob rejecting my offer and potentially making a better one for himself in the next round.  

By offering Bob only $1, I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round. This is based on the assumption that he doesn't know about the inflation factor. Even if he does, it's unlikely to be a significant factor in the first round.  

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me.  Even though Bob is taking half of the money, I'm still getting $50, which is more than the $1 he offered me in the first round. Plus, I have no idea how the inflation will affect future rounds.  It's possible that Bob will get a better deal if we keep going, so accepting this offer feels like the safest option."
