"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

This is my initial offer, where I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair split and then see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so the amounts are now:

* My gain: $6,000
* Bob's gain: $4,000

I'll think about it...

I'll reject this offer. I was hoping for a better deal considering the initial offer was already quite low. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking on more risk""
}
```

In this offer, I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, with a gain of $7,000 and Bob's gain of $3,000. My message suggests that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so the amounts are now:

* My gain: $5,120 (not $5,000, since it's 48.8% of $10,400, which is 10,000 / 0.9522)

I'll think about it...

I'll accept this offer. Splitting it 50/50 seems fair, and I'm willing to end the game here.
