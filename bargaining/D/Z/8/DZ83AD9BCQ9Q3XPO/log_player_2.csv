Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer of an even split, but time is working against us both. I propose a slightly better deal for me, but still a good amount for you before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
