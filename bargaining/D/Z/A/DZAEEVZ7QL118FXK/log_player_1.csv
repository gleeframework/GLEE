"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a bit more fair, considering the inflation risk.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think a 60/40 split is fair, considering we're starting with a 50/50 split. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose a slightly more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation risk. Let's try again!""}

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to maintain a relatively balanced split."
