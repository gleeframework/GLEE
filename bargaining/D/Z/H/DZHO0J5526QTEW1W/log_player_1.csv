Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice.  I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is your last chance for a decent share before inflation eats away at your potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
