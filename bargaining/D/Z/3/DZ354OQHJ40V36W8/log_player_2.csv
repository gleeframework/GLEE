"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a small share to get this started. I'm confident we can find a better deal for both of us in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While 1000 dollars is something, it's a very small share. Since the money is worth less each round, it's better to try and negotiate a better deal.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to give up more to avoid a complete loss in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more even split.  We both lose money with each passing round, so let's find a deal that benefits us both sooner rather than later.""
