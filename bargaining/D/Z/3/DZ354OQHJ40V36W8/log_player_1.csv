"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more even split.  We both lose money with each passing round, so let's find a deal that benefits us both sooner rather than later. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
