"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000/100,000 split, with me getting the lion's share. While it might seem unfair, I'm considering the potential inflation and want to secure a larger portion early on.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with this offer,  the inflation is taking a big bite out of my potential gains. Accepting this offer at least guarantees me something, whereas rejecting it means I might end up with nothing in the next round."
