{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""I'd like to propose a 65/35 split in my favor.  While it's not exactly a 50/50 split, it's a fairer reflection of the fact that I'm risking more due to the inflation.  We can both still come out ahead.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, my offer was already generous.  Your proposal doesn't reflect the pace at which my potential gains decrease. Let's settle this â€“ 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
