Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a good starting point for negotiation.

# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but I'm aiming for a slightly more favorable outcome. This offer is a compromise between our previous positions. Let's settle this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 487500 
# Alice gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is incrementally moving towards a fairer split, but it's still beneficial for Bob to hold out a little longer.  The threat of inflation creates a sense of urgency, and Bob can leverage that to secure a slightly better deal in the next round or two."
