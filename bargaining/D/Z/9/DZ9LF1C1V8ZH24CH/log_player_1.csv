"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try to get as much money as possible for myself, but I'm also aware of inflation. A small offer might be better than risking nothing in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would like more money, there is no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round. Accepting this ensures I get at least half of the money."
