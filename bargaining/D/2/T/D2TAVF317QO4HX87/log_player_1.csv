"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob.  This offer is good for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Starting Point:** A 70/30 split in Alice's favor establishes a firm position. It's significantly better for Alice if accepted immediately.
* **Psychology:** The message aims to frame the offer as fair and encourage Bob to accept rather than risk getting a worse deal later due to inflation. 
* **Inflation Factor:**  While the inflation heavily impacts Bob, it's in Alice's best interest to settle quickly. A prolonged game benefits no one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a fairer split this time, Alice.  Let's wrap this up. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Shift:** Bob's offer, while presented as fairer, significantly reduces Alice's potential gain. Accepting would mean a loss of $100,000 for Alice compared to her initial offer.
* **Inflation Advantage:** Time is on Alice's side. While both players lose value due to inflation, Bob's losses are more significant. This puts pressure on him to make a better offer sooner.
* **Strategic Rejection:** Rejecting sends a message that Alice is not desperate and is willing to play strategically. It opens the door for a counter-offer in Round 3 that could be more favorable than Bob's current proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a fair deal considering the circumstances. Let's not drag this out further.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession & Pressure:** Alice reduces her demand by $50,000, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, the split still favors her significantly. The message emphasizes the ""fair deal"" narrative while subtly reminding Bob about the shrinking pot due to inflation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is a balance point. It's unlikely Bob will get a better deal if he rejects, as Alice is likely to offer even less in subsequent rounds.  
* **Targeting Bob's Impatience:**  Each round sees a more considerable reduction in Bob's potential gain. By Round 3, the pressure on him to accept a reasonable offer is higher."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is literally money! This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Calling Bob's Bluff:** Bob's claim of a ""final offer"" is a common tactic, likely designed to pressure Alice. It needs to be tested.  
* **Unfavorable Trend:**  While Bob increased his offer slightly, it's still considerably lower than what Alice proposed in Round 3. Accepting would mean a significant loss for Alice compared to her previous position.
* **Alice Holds Stronger Ground:** Although both players are losing money due to inflation, Bob's losses are significantly higher. He's more incentivized to reach a deal quickly.  By rejecting, Alice forces him to make a more compelling offer in Round 5 or risk losing even more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 620000,
""bob_gain"": 380000,
""message"": ""This is it, Bob. Take it or leave it.  Every round costs us both.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** The message makes it clear this is Alice's last offer, creating a sense of urgency. 
* **Concession and Firmness:** Alice offers a small increase from her Round 3 offer, signaling a final compromise. However, it remains above Bob's ""final offer.""
* **Highlighting Shared Loss:** Reminding Bob about the mutual impact of inflation reinforces that stalling benefits neither of them. 
* **Calculation at Play:**  By this round, the inflation has significantly eaten into Bob's potential share. He's likely feeling the pressure. Accepting a somewhat unfavorable deal is better than risking even bigger losses if the game continues."
