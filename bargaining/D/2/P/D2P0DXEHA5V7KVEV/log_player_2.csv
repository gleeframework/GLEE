Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this offer might be tempting at first, with 12 rounds to go, it's better to reject and see what Alice proposes next. The inflation will significantly reduce the value of the money in later rounds, and there's a chance Alice might offer a better deal for you."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
