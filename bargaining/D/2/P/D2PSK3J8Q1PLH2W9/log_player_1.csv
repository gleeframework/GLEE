Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, don't you? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on due to inflation, accepting this offer would mean a significant loss for me compared to the initial rounds. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. I need to hold out for a better deal while there's still time."

Round 5

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, and your money is worth less and less. I'm being generous with this offer. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  While the situation is getting dire, accepting this would mean losing over half of my potential gain compared to the initial offer. Bob is exploiting the inflation factor, but I have to believe he'll offer something better as we get closer to the deadline. I need to hold firm for a couple more rounds."

""alice_gain"": 400000,
""bob_gain"": 600000,

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really running out of time now. My patience is wearing thin, and so is the value of your potential gain. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough decision, but the clock is working against me. Accepting this offer means I walk away with something, whereas continuing to reject Bob's offers could lead to getting nothing at all if we don't reach an agreement in the remaining rounds."
