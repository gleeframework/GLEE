Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing to split the $1,000,000 equally between us, with each of us getting $500,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'll give you more than 20% 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll think about the value of the money I'll gain.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a better offer this time. Since Bob's offer was 800,000 for me, I'll try to get a bit more. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still want a decent chunk""}

I'm proposing to give Bob 650,000 and keep 350,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small amount, but I'm taking the majority 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money worth only 48.8% of its original value, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer of 100,000 is a paltry sum, but I'm not sure I can do better.
