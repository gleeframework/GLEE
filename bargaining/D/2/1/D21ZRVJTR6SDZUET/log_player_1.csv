Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 50,

}
```

I'm proposing a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 40 is now worth 32 (80% of 40), and Bob's gain of 60 is worth 54 (90% of 60).

I'm not thrilled about the proposed split, but I'll consider it. I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
