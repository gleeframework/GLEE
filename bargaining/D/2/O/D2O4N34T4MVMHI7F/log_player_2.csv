"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more since it's my turn next round and inflation will hurt my earnings. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  You got the better deal last round, so I'll take a bit more this time.  If we keep splitting it evenly, we both get less as inflation bites.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm losing money with every round we play, and you're just holding out for a better deal. This offer is still generous considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
