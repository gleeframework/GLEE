"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's time we both got a little more. My offer is a bit more in my favor, but you get a bigger share of the remaining money as it depreciates faster for you. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I suppose it's a bit better than the 60-40 split you initially proposed. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the depreciation rate. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, but still leaving room for negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
