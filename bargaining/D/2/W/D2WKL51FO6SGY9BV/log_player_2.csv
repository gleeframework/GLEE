"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer. Even though it's a fair split, I want to see if I can get a better deal in the next round.  I know Alice's money is worth less with each passing round, so I might be able to get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think it's time we both got a little more. My offer is a bit more in my favor, but you get a bigger share of the remaining money as it depreciates faster for you. What do you say?"" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the depreciation rate. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a higher amount, the depreciation rate is a major factor. This offer is closer to a fair split, and I don't want to risk losing even more in the next round."
