"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I want more for my efforts 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is worth 5% less than the initial amount, I'll calculate the actual value of the offer in terms of the initial amount.

Bob's offer is worth 600,000 in the initial amount, which is 600,000 / 0.95 = 631,579.47 in terms of the current value.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, considering I could potentially get a better deal in the future.
