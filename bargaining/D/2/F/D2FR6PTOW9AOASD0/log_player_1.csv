"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. This 3:1 ratio is a good starting point, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share than the initial proposal. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
