"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a good deal, don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000 dollars, which is a generous share considering the initial amount. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can split the money quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was too generous indeed!

After the first round, the money is worth 20% less, so the actual amount I'm considering now is $560,000 (700,000 x 0.8).

Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: 200,000
* Bob gain: 800,000

I'm not happy with this offer. I think I can do better. I'll reject it.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, but I want a better share!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the 20% decrease in value due to inflation. The actual amount I'm considering now is $448,000 (700,000 x 0.8 x 0.8). I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but still a decent one, hoping he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but don't expect more! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard!

After the first three rounds, the money is worth 48.8% less, so the actual amount I'm considering now is $352,000 (700,000 x 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.8).

Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: 450,000
* Bob gain: 550,000

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time. I think I'll accept this offer to get some money, but I'm not happy about it.
