"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous this round, but we need to start negotiating.  Let's work towards a fair split! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as it's heavily biased towards Alice, and I believe I can negotiate a better split in the subsequent rounds. Additionally, the 20% inflation rate per round for me means I need to be strategic about when to accept an offer to maximize my gain.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and be fair, considering the inflation I'm facing.""}\n\nIn this offer, I've taken into account the need for a more balanced split, considering the impact of inflation on my gain. By proposing a 40-60 split, I'm hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable step towards a mutually acceptable agreement, especially since she doesn't face the inflation penalty. This approach aims to establish a foundation for further negotiation, acknowledging the unfairness of the initial offer and the unique conditions of the game."
