"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a very lopsided offer, giving Bob only 50,000. I'm hoping he'll accept, as it's better than nothing, and the inflation will hurt him more than me in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting significantly less than I initially proposed, it's still a good deal considering the inflation.  I'm guaranteed 400,000, and Bob gets 600,000.  I'm unlikely to get a better offer in the next round."
