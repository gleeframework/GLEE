Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we divide the money as 550000 for me and 450000 for you. It's still a fair split given the decrease in value. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000
