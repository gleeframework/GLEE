"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, Bob.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting we split it evenly to start, leaving room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value due to inflation, I'd like to get a slightly better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to get a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money's value decreasing due to inflation, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will accept this offer."
