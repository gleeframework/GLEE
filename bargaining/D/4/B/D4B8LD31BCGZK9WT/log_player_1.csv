"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, I'm not settling for this! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $3,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $2,400.

I don't think I can do better than this offer, so I'll accept it.
