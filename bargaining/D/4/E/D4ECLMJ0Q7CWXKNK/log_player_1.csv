Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing value with each round.  I'm willing to give you a slight advantage this time, but let's try to reach a deal before the inflation hurts us both too much. 
# Alice gain: 4950 
# Bob gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is feeling the pressure from inflation, but his offer is still worse for me than my last offer to him. He's willing to accept that I get more, so I'll push my advantage a little further while it still holds value for me."
