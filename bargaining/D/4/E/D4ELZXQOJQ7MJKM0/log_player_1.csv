Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and try to get most of the money in the first round.  I'll offer Bob $1,000, hoping he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more money, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting less in the next round due to inflation."
