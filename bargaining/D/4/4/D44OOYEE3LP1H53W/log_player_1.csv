"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $2,000 and keep $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, and I was initially offered $8,000, I'll get $8,000 * 0.95 = $7,600. 

Bob's offer is $6,000 for me and $4,000 for him. Since $4,000 is worth 20% less than the $5,000 he initially offered, it's equivalent to $5,000 / 0.8 = $6,250. 

So, in terms of the initial $10,000, Bob is offering me $6,000 and himself $6,250. This is a good deal for me, as I'm getting more than I initially offered in Round 1, and it's a better split than the initial offer. 

I'll accept this offer.
