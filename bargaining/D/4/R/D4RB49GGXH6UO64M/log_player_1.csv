I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as it gives him a significant advantage. I was hoping for a more even split, and this offer is too lopsided in his favor. I'll reject it and hope to do better in the next round."

I'm really unhappy with Bob's offer this time. The gap between our gains is getting too large, and I'm starting to feel like I'm getting squeezed out. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
