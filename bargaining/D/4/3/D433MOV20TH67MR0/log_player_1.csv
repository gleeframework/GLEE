"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob will accept a generous 90% for me!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though I'm losing money due to inflation, this is a fair split and it's better than risking another round and potentially getting even less."
