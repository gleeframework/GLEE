# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take anything, it's better to see if we can get a better deal in the next round.  We have 12 rounds to play, so there's time to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,

  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's a fair deal, and we can both walk away with a sizable amount.""

# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still demanding too much. While the money is worth less to me with each round, I still have time to negotiate for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,

# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still not comfortable with that split. Although the clock is ticking, I believe we can still reach a more equitable agreement. I'm willing to keep negotiating."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to give you a little more, but not much. If you want any money at all, you need to accept this. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the deal is far from ideal, the inflation is drastically reducing the value of the money I would gain. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, whereas rejecting it risks getting nothing at all."
