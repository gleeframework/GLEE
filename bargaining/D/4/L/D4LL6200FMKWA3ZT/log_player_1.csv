"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'll start by offering Bob a smaller portion, hoping he'll accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger portion, I'm better off accepting Bob's offer. The value of the money is decreasing with each round, and waiting might result in a worse deal."
