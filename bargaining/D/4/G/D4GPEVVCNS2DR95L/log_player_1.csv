"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me a larger share, but it's a decent compromise to start the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me an even smaller share. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly larger share to make up for the value loss due to inflation."
