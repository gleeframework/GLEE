"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. I'm framing it as a ""fair split"" to see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, as I'll be taking on the risk of rejection in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist!

Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, my gain of $40 is actually worth $38 in real terms.

I'm not convinced by Bob's argument that he's taking on more risk, since I'm the one who made the initial proposal and took the risk of rejection. I think I can do better than this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less again, my gain of $38 is now worth $36.15 in real terms.

I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's compromise""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45 and keeping $55 for myself, hoping to find a middle ground that he'll accept."
