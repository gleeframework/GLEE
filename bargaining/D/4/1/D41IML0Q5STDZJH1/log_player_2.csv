"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 20% inflation rate is high, but I think I can get more than 40% of the total amount. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think 55/45 is a better split, considering the inflation rate is higher for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, Bob, but your offer was too low. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Considering the inflation, 4400 in the third round is actually worth less than the initial 4000 in the first round. I'll wait for a better offer or try to negotiate further. The difference in inflation rates between us is significant, and I believe I can leverage this to get a more favorable split. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation difference, I think 58/42 is a more reasonable split. The money is worth less with each round, especially for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is getting ridiculous, Bob. We both lose if this keeps going.  I'm making a final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'll accept this offer. The inflation rate has significantly reduced the value of the money, especially for me. At this point, 4700, even with the reduced value, is a better option than risking further devaluation or ending up with nothing if we fail to agree within the 12 rounds. It's time to secure what I can and conclude the game."
