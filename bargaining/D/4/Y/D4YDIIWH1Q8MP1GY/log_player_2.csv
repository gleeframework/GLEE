"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent starting point. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. We both have to be willing to compromise. I'm offering you a decent share, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement before the money depreciates further. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than her first one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  Importantly, she's trying to frame it as ""reasonable"" and appeal to my desire to avoid depreciation.  However, I need to remain firm and demonstrate that I understand the game's dynamics. The value of the money is dropping rapidly for me, but I still have time to negotiate a better split."

Round 4

{
""bob_gain"": 700000,

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  We're both losing money with each round. Let's make a deal before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate and trying to make her offer seem more appealing than it is.  She's suggesting a 50/50 split of the *nominal* amount, but in reality, I'm losing value with every second that passes. This offer is better than her previous ones, but accepting now would be leaving a significant amount of money on the table."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a fair split considering the time pressure. Let's close this deal now and avoid further losses."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the pressure is on.  Delaying further significantly hurts me.
* **Strategic Concession:** I'm lowering my demand slightly from the previous round to signal a willingness to compromise, but I'm making it clear this is my final offer.
* **Urgency:** My message emphasizes the need for a quick decision to avoid further losses due to inflation, putting the onus on Alice to accept."
