Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  I think this is a fair starting point, considering Bob's money is worth less than mine in each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, especially given the inflation. It's better than risking losing everything in further rounds."
