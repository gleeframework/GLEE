"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer. The money is still worth a significant amount, and I don't want to settle for less than I can get.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm trying to be more moderate in this offer, considering the inflation and the fact that we have 9 rounds left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less than the original amount, the stakes are getting higher. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll accept this offer. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk going home with nothing.
