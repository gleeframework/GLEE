"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, there's potential for a better deal, especially considering the inflation factor. I want to see if I can get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a fair compromise, as I'm giving Alice a slightly better deal than she offered in the first round.  I believe this is a good starting point to see if she'll accept, but I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice is now losing money due to inflation. While I still prefer a 60/40 split, accepting this offer ensures I get some money and Alice doesn't lose too much. There's a good chance she'll continue to lose money with each round, making it less likely she'll offer me more later."
