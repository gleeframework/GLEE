"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll start""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you can have a little 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a better deal, 50/50 would be fair""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will reconsider and offer a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 20% less again, I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to get a bit more than 50/50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most, you'll get a small share 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly!

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth significantly less, I'll try to negotiate again. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's too uneven, I'd like more""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will come back with a more balanced offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less, I'll aim for a slightly higher share again. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, let's try to make a deal""
}
```

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, trying to get a bit more than the previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take almost all, you'll get a tiny share 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting!

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is almost worthless at this point, I'll try to negotiate one last time. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's too one-sided, I'd rather go to the next round""
}
```

I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, Bob will come back with an even more desperate offer, and I can try to squeeze out a slightly better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","At this point, the money is almost worthless, but I'll still try to make a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 10,
  ""bob_gain"": 90,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, just end this""
}
```

I'm proposing a 10/90 split, essentially giving Bob the vast majority of the remaining value. I'm hoping this will finally end the game and bring some closure."
