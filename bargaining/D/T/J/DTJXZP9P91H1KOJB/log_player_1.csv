Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly.""}\n\nI'm offering $550,000 for myself and $450,000 for Bob, with a message suggesting a fair division. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be realistic about the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Given the impact of inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Let's see what happens next!"
