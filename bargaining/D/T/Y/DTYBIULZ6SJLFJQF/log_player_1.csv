Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering Bob $10, and keeping $90 for myself.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm the one making the initial offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm aware of the inflation,  taking $10 in this round would be significantly less than what I proposed in the first round, and I'm not willing to accept that.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. This is a compromise considering the inflation, and I think it's a fair deal that we can both agree on.  Let's see if Bob is ready to accept."
