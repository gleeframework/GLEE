"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems fair in the short term, I (Bob) lose value on the money every round. It's worth holding out for a better offer, even if it means getting a slightly smaller percentage of the pot later. The risk of getting nothing at the end means it's generally better to secure a deal sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""My turn. This offer accounts for the time pressure on my end."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Every round, the value of the money decreases for Bob. He needs to push for a larger share now to compensate for future losses.
* **Stronger Position:** By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signaled he's willing to play strategically. This might incentivize Alice to accept a less favorable deal now.
* **Not Too Greedy:**  A 55/45 split is a significant jump from Alice's offer but not so extreme that it completely alienates her. There's still room for negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a better deal for you than the last one. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is correct that her offer is technically better than her last one considering the inflation. However, it's still not favorable enough for me (Bob). Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** While a $200 increase is welcome, the inflation rate means I'm losing value rapidly. Waiting even one more round will cost me significantly.
* **Negotiating Position:** Alice is clearly aware of the time pressure I'm under. Rejecting this offer shows I'm serious about securing a larger portion of the money to offset the inflation disadvantage.
* **Aiming for Compromise:**  There's still time for a compromise. My ideal outcome is to reach a deal quickly in the next round or two.  

I need to incentivize Alice to make a more compelling offer by demonstrating my willingness to walk away from a less favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Time is running out. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** Round 4 is a critical point. The money is losing value fast, and I need to strike a balance between getting a good deal and securing something before it's too late. 
* **Slight Concession:** This offer is slightly lower than my previous one, signaling to Alice that I'm willing to negotiate. However, it's still a better deal than her previous offers considering the inflation.
* **Direct Message:** Emphasizing the time pressure and presenting this as a fair deal might encourage Alice to accept before the money diminishes further for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, this is a good compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation has become critical. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The 59.04% devaluation significantly impacts my potential gains. Waiting any longer is incredibly risky. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even if I could secure a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the inflation would eat into those gains considerably.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a significantly better offer is very risky now.  Alice knows time is on her side, and there's a real chance we both walk away with nothing if I reject this.

It's painful to accept a smaller share, but the alternative is likely worse at this stage."
