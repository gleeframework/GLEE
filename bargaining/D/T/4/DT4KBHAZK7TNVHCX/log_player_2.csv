Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still confident we can find a better solution. This is a fair starting point.  Let's continue talking. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor. The inflation is hurting me more than it is her, so holding out too long will hurt me more. However, I need to push for a significantly better deal in the next few rounds."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. This offer acknowledges your initial generosity while recognizing the time pressure and inflation working against us."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be pragmatic.  With inflation hitting us both hard, a 50/50 split is the fairest and most sensible way to ensure we both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a slightly better outcome, the risk of getting nothing significantly outweighs the potential reward. Accepting the 50/50 split ensures a decent payout considering the inflation and the remaining rounds."
