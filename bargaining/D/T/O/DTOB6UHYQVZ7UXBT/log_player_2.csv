"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept a deal where Alice gets 60% and I get 40%.  Let's see if I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""It's my turn now! I'm going to propose a fairer split, with 60 for me and 40 for you.  Let's see if you're willing to be more reasonable this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle, Bob. 50-50 seems like a fair split to me. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It seems like the best I can do at this point. Accepting a 50/50 split is better than getting nothing."
