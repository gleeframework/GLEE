"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, I'll consider the adjusted values. My proposed gain of 600,000 in the first round is now worth 540,000 in the second round.

Bob's offer is 300,000, which is less than my adjusted gain from the first round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round (10% less in the second round, and another 10% less in the third round), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

In the first round, my gain was worth $600,000. In the second round, it was worth $540,000. Now, in the third round, it's worth $504,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```"
