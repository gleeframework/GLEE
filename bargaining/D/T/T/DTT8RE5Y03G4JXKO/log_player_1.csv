"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
```

I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with only $1. Since it's the first round, I want to see if he'll accept such an unfair offer. If he doesn't, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would love to get more, it's clear Bob is willing to split the money evenly. With the inflation on his side, there's no reason to risk it. Accepting this offer is the best choice for me in the long run."
