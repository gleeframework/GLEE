"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more equitable. Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain.

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of 400,000$ is actually worth 380,000$ in real terms.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with this offer, but I don't want to risk going into another round. I'll accept this offer.
