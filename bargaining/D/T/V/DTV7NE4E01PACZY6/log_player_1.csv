Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is proposing a 60-40 split in his favor, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to see if I can negotiate a better deal.
