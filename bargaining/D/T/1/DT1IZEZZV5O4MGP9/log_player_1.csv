"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose dividing the money equally, as it seems fair to both parties. Considering the inflation, this might be the best we can do. 
# Alice gain: 505000 
# Bob gain: 495000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
