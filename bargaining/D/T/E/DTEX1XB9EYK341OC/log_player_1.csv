"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob. I figure it's good to establish trust and see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is unfair. I know the money is worth less each round, but I'm not going to give up 90% of the money. I'm willing to negotiate, but this is too far."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 800,000, but I'm still giving Bob a substantial share. I want to show him I'm willing to compromise, but I won't be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Even with the inflation, I'm not going to accept less than 40% of the money. I'm willing to negotiate further, but this is not acceptable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get at least 70% of the money. I'm hoping Bob will see that we need to come to an agreement soon before the inflation hurts us both more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than I would like, the inflation is hitting him much harder than me. Accepting this offer is the best course of action to avoid losing even more money."
