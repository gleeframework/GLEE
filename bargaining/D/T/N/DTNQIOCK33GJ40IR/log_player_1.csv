"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will be more impactful on Bob in the long run."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is tempting, it's still more beneficial for me to hold out. By rejecting, I can control the next round and potentially get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. The inflation is starting to take a toll, and a fair split seems like the best way to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With the inflation hitting so hard, I need to accept this offer. While it's not ideal, getting 4500 is better than risking further losses and potentially getting nothing in later rounds."
