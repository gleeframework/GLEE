"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering Bob $40, which is a fair share, and I'll take $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a 50-50 split, which is fair considering the reduced value of the money."
