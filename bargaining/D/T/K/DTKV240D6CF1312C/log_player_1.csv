I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  Since this is the first round, I'm being generous, but I'm also being strategic. I want to establish a precedent that I'm willing to take the majority of the money.  We'll see if Bob is willing to accept that or risk the consequences of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is getting greedy!  I'm not accepting this offer.  While the inflation is hitting me harder, I still think I can do better by pushing for a higher share.  I'll try to get a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $400,000.  While I'm still taking the majority, I'm trying to be a bit more reasonable.  I want to see if Bob is more willing to compromise now that he's seen the effects of inflation on his end.  Hopefully, he'll accept this offer and we can both walk away with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, and with the inflation hitting me so hard, I'm going to take it.  I'd rather have a decent amount now than risk getting nothing if the game goes on."
