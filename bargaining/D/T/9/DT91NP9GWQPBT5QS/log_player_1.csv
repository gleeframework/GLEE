{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. I would only get $100,000, which is a significant decrease from the initial $500,000 I proposed, and even more so from the $600,000 I proposed in round 3. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer, especially considering the value of the money has decreased due to inflation. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm extremely unhappy with this offer. I would only get $1000, which is an insultingly small amount considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer, especially when Bob is still getting the majority of the money. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round, or I might as well just accept the initial 50/50 split."

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a tiny bit, but I'm not getting any more generous either""}

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, where I would receive $900,000 and Bob would receive $100,000. I'm trying to make a final stand and get a decent amount of money, considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation."

I'm not getting any better offers, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'm willing to accept this offer, even though it's a tiny amount, just to get something. I'll take the $1 and call it a day."
