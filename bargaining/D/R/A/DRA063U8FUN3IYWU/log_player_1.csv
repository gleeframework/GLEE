"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is my initial offer. I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor. I'll take into account the inflation, but I want to start strong."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer means I get $5500 (worth less than the $6000 I initially wanted, but still a decent amount), and the game ends. Rejecting means I get to propose, but then Bob gets to decide, and with inflation, my potential gain gets smaller with each round.  It's a risk to keep going."
