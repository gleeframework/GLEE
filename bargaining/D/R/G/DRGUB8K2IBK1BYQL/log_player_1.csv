"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a good compromise. I'll accept this offer.
