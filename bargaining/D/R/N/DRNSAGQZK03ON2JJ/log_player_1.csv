  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. I think 30:70 is a fair split, considering the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{
