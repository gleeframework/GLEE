"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money!""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's Offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It made sense to reject and counter-propose.
* **My Offer:**  I'm offering a slightly better deal for Alice than if she waits for another round (where her potential gain decreases due to inflation). 
* **Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes the time sensitivity due to inflation, hopefully encouraging Alice to accept a deal now."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer, let's meet halfway! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to a more even split, but it's still in her favor. Given the rapid inflation for me, holding out for a slightly better deal in the next round is worth the risk."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's stop wasting time. 50/50, take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The Impact of Inflation:**  At this point, inflation is severely cutting into potential gains. It's no longer strategic to hold out for a slightly larger share.
* **Fairness as Leverage:** Offering a 50/50 split is undeniably fair.  It puts pressure on Alice, as rejecting this offer could make her appear greedy and unwilling to compromise.
* **Direct Communication:** The message is direct and conveys a sense of urgency.  Delaying further only hurts both players."
