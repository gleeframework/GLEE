# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more favorable split this time.  Let's make a deal and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 20% less in this round, I need to consider the reduced value. Considering this, Bob's offer of $350,000 for me is actually worth less due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round. My decision is to reject.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking and we're both losing money. I'm proposing a split that's beneficial for both of us. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIn Round 4, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I need to weigh the benefits of accepting Bob's offer against the risk of further decreases in value. However, since the money I gain is now worth 48.8% less than in the first round, Bob's offer of $400,000 is actually worth significantly less in real terms. Given this substantial decrease in value and the fact that we still have several rounds left, I'll reject this offer in hopes of negotiating a better deal in subsequent rounds.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see how negotiations unfold."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, with the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us, it's crucial to make an offer that accounts for the decreasing worth while still trying to find a mutually acceptable division. Given the substantial decrease in value for my gain and a lesser but still significant decrease for Bob's gain, I will adjust my offer to make it more appealing to Bob while ensuring I don't compromise too much on my end.

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise more to account for inflation's impact on both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm aiming to find a middle ground that recognizes the urgency and the impact of inflation, hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob and we can conclude the negotiations."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're past the halfway point! This offer is a good deal considering inflation. Let's settle this now before we both lose out further. 
# Alice gain: 430000 
# Bob gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 6, with the money I gain being worth 67.23% less than in the first round, the real value of Bob's offer of $430,000 is significantly diminished. However, considering we are past the halfway point and the impact of inflation is severe on my potential gains, I must reassess the risk of holding out for a better deal against the certainty of this offer. Given the substantial loss in value and the decreasing likelihood of achieving a significantly better offer in the remaining rounds, I'll accept this offer to ensure I receive some value before it further depreciates.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a deal before the value decreases further."
