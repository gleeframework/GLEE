"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob.  I believe this split reflects the time pressure we're both under. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this seems like a reasonable offer, it's important to consider the inflation factor. I'll wait for my turn to propose a split that benefits us both in the long run."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this split is fairer, considering the inflation we both face. Let's make a deal before things get worse!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer doesn't reflect the urgency of the situation for me. I'm losing value faster. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, I'm losing value faster than Alice. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something before the money becomes worthless."
