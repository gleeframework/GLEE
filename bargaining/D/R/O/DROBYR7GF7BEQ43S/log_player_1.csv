"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of the money, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in round 2, so it's worth 90% of the original value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, but still being fair to Bob. Let's see if he accepts!"

```"

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500
