This is a terrible deal for Bob!  While it's tempting to take something,  it's important to remember inflation will rapidly reduce the value of this small amount. Let's see if Alice will be more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's not ideal, this offer is significantly better than the previous round.  Even with the inflation, I'm gaining a much larger amount than before.  It's time to secure what I can."
