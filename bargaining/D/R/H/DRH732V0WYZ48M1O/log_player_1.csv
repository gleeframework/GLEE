"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\n###\n\nI am proposing a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. The message I've included is ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start."" This proposal is a reasonable starting point, offering Bob a significant share while also reflecting the slight advantage I have due to the inflation rules favoring me. The message aims to set a tone of fairness and cooperation, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously and respond positively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value decreases for me each round. How about a slightly better split this time? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although Bob's message attempts to justify a better split for himself due to the decreasing value of the money for him, his proposed division of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for himself doesn't align with my initial aim for a fair split. Given that the money's value remains the same for me but decreases for Bob, I believe I can negotiate a more favorable division in subsequent rounds. By rejecting this offer, I'll have the opportunity to propose a new division in the next round that better suits my preferences."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I've adjusted the offer slightly in your favor from my initial proposal.""}\n\n###\n\nI am proposing a division of $5,800 for myself and $4,200 for Bob. In the message, I acknowledge the impact of inflation on Bob's share and indicate that I've adjusted my offer from the initial proposal to slightly favor him. However, I still maintain a higher share for myself, leveraging the fact that the money's value remains constant for me but decreases for Bob. The aim is to find a balance that might be acceptable to Bob, given the circumstances, while maximizing my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic.  This is the most straightforward and fair deal. We both lose if we drag this on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. Given the current state of the game, with the money's value decreasing significantly for Bob but remaining constant for me, Bob's proposal of an equal split ($5,000 for each) seems reasonable. His message emphasizes the importance of reaching an agreement before the value decreases further, and the risk of both losing if the game continues. Considering the decreasing value for Bob and the potential for further decreases, accepting this offer ensures a guaranteed gain of $5,000, which is a more secure option than risking further negotiations that might result in a less favorable outcome or no gain at all."
