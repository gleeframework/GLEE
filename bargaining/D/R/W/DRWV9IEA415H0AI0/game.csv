60.0,40.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the inflation rate affects me more.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
55.0,45.0,Your starting offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  This is more balanced while acknowledging the inflation difference.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
58.0,42.0,Your offer isn't accounting for the faster rate of inflation on my end. This is a compromise.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,This is getting us nowhere. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly before inflation eats away at the value.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
