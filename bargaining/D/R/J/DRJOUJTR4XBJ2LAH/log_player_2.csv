Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing me, let's compromise 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is hitting Alice much harder than Bob. While her offers might seem ""fair"" on the surface, the longer the game goes on, the less enticing her offers will become for her. Bob still has some leverage to try and secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""This is it - my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, especially with how fast the inflation is rising.  Let's end this before we both lose out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting.  A firm stance is needed to push for a beneficial outcome.
* **Exploiting inflation:** Alice is losing value faster than Bob.  While a 50/50 split seems ""fair"" now, it's actually advantageous to Bob as the rounds progress.
* **Finality:** By stating it's the ""final offer"", Bob creates a sense of urgency and a clear decision point for Alice.  She either accepts a decent deal now, or risks getting a much worse offer later."
