"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $6000 and leave $4000 for Bob, with a message suggesting they should be reasonable about the division. Given the rules of the game, where the value of money decreases with each round, starting with a higher offer might incentivize Bob to accept sooner rather than later, minimizing the loss due to inflation for both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but this is more fair considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the adjusted values due to inflation, accepting this offer would mean Alice gets a significantly reduced amount compared to the first round, and the difference in the loss of value between Alice's and Bob's shares is considerable. Rejecting this offer gives Alice the chance to propose a new division in the next round, potentially leveraging the increasing loss due to inflation to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Inflation is costing us both, let's settle""}\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation, Alice increases her proposed share to $7000, aiming to maximize her gain while still offering Bob a significant amount, albeit reduced due to the rounds of negotiation. The message emphasizes the shared cost of inflation, urging Bob to consider the diminishing value of the money and the benefit of accepting the offer now rather than risking further loss in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my last offer.  Let's end this before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant loss in value due to inflation, especially for Alice, accepting this offer seems the most prudent decision. The difference in the loss of value between Alice's and Bob's shares is substantial, and further rounds would only exacerbate this issue. Bob's message indicating this is his last offer suggests he is also aware of the diminishing returns and is willing to walk away if necessary. Accepting ensures Alice receives a tangible amount rather than risking a further decrease in value or the possibility of Bob sticking to his word and ending negotiations."
