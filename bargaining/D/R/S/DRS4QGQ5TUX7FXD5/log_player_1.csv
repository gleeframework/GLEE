"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $70 and Bob gets $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiation.

I reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to get a better deal. With inflation, the money is worth even less now, so I'll aim for a bigger share.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
