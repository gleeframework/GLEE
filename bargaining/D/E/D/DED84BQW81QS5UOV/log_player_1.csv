Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a balanced division for this round. We both receive a significant amount, setting a fair foundation for future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is more ""balanced"" than my initial proposal, it's still not in my best interest. 

* **Inflation:**  Even though Bob's money is only devalued by 5%, my money is devalued by 10%! This means accepting his offer would be significantly worse for me in the long run.
* **Future Rounds:** I believe I can do better in future rounds. If I reject this offer, I get to propose in the next round, and I can capitalize on the inflation disadvantage Bob faces.

By rejecting, I increase the pressure on Bob and position myself for a potentially more favorable outcome in the upcoming rounds."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be reasonable, but I need to make up for the losses from the inflation. Let's split the money 60/40 this time. This will ensure both of us get a good share, and we can work towards a more balanced split in future rounds.""}
