"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40. I'll get the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll receive as $55 * 0.95 = $52.25 for me and $45 * 0.95 = $42.75 for Bob.

I'll accept this offer.
