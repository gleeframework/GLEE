Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to see how much she can get away with.  While the offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  We're past the halfway point in the rounds, so it's time to start applying more pressure."

Round 6

{
""bob_gain"": 5500,

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not intimidated, I'll still take the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one, but time is running out. Alice doesn't seem to be budging much. While this offer isn't ideal, accepting guarantees we both walk away with something. If I reject, there's a real risk of getting zero in the end if we can't reach an agreement."
