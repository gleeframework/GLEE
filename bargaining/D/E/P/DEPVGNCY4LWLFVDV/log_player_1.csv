"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a third.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting 70 dollars and Bob getting 30 dollars. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm really hoping Bob will accept this generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split would be fairer. Let's try 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a toll!

Considering the 20% decrease in value, my gain of 40 dollars is now worth 32 dollars. Bob's gain of 60 dollars is worth 48 dollars.

I'm not sure if 60/40 is a more balanced split, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 60/40 is fair, let's try 55/45 instead.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 55/45 is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm sticking to my previous message, but adjusting the numbers slightly to reflect the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 70/30 is a reasonable compromise, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really adding up!

Considering the 48.8% decrease in value, my gain of 30 dollars is now worth approximately 15.6 dollars. Bob's gain of 70 dollars is worth approximately 35.2 dollars.

I'm not sure if 70/30 is a reasonable compromise, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept this offer.
