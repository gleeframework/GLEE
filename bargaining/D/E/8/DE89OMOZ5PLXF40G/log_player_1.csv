Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$, which is 45% of the original amount, and keeping 550,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal next time, but not now! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to accept this offer, since it's better than my previous one and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal later.
