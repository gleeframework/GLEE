"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While it seems fair on the surface, Bob is getting a smaller share, and with the inflation factor in the game, it's better to try and get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation factor. Let's get this done.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for you. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Bob's share is less than his previous offer, the inflation factor means that it's worth less to him.  It's better to secure this offer than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
