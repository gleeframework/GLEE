"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, my proposed gain of $6,000 in the previous round is now equivalent to $5,400. Bob's offer of $5,000 is a bit less than that, but I'll consider it.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
