Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's be a bit more even-handed this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money! This is a good deal for you before inflation eats away at your share even more.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise. This offer ensures we both get a decent share before the value drops even further. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While similar to Alice's first offer, Bob's offer in Round 4 is actually better for Alice now due to the significant inflation impacting Bob's share. Accepting ensures Alice gets a reasonable amount, and avoids the risk of getting a much worse deal or nothing at all in later rounds."
