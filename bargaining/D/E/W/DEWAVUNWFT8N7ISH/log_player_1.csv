"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 3:1, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split, but also hinting that I'm willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing, let's be realistic! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal.

I'll think for a moment... Considering the inflation, $200,000 is actually a significant amount, but I still think I can do better.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the value of the money again, so I need to be strategic.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $400,000, which is a more balanced split, but still slightly in my favor. My message is a friendly one, suggesting we meet in the middle and make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too generous, I'll take it from here! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard! $100,000 is a tiny fraction of what I initially proposed, but I need to consider the rapidly decreasing value of money.

I'll think carefully... Considering the inflation, $100,000 is actually a very small amount, and I'm starting to run out of time.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to make a final push.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I need to be more aggressive now.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share to $300,000, but still keeping a significant amount for myself. My message is a warning that this is my final offer, and I'm trying to pressure Bob into accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take the rest! 
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is crushing the value of the money! $10,000 is an incredibly small amount, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.

I'll think carefully... Considering the inflation, $10,000 is almost negligible, and I'm running out of time. I don't want to leave Bob with almost all the money, but I also don't want to get nothing.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
