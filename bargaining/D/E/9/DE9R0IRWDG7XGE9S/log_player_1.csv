I'll start by proposing a very lopsided split in my favor.  It's unlikely Bob will accept, but it's a starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer.  It's just as unfair to me as my offer was to him. Let's see if we can find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 50/50 split. This seems like the fairest way to divide the money."
