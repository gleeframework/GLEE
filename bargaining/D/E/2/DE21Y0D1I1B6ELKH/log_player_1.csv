"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation will impact me more in the following rounds. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
