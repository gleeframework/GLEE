"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 70/30 split is still more fair considering the inflation will continue to impact you more heavily in the future rounds. Let's reach a deal before the money depreciates further. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000
