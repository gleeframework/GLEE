Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear that dragging this out only hurts us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution. Let's not lose any more money to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
