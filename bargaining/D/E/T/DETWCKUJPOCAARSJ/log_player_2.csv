Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is holding us both back.  I'll come down a bit to 51/49, but we need to close this out now. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game continues, the less the money is worth to both of us, but particularly to Alice (losing 10% per round). This makes her more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on.
* **Alice's Position Weakening:** Her offer in Round 3 is already lower than her initial offer (55/45). This demonstrates her increasing willingness to compromise due to inflation. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer hoping for a better deal in Round 4 is very risky. The potential gain from a slightly better split might be outweighed by the guaranteed loss in value due to inflation.

Accepting the 49/51 split secures a reasonable amount of money, even if slightly less than desired. It avoids the risk of walking away with significantly less in a later round.
