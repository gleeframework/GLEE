{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a slightly larger share""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the total amount ($8,000) and Bob gets 20% ($2,000)."

# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better split, especially considering the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is the maximum I can offer 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I think this is a decent compromise. I'll take the 4500 and hope that it's the best I can get."
