"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the smaller share this round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $40 is now worth 80% of its original value, and Bob's gain of $60 is worth 95% of its original value.

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a larger share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept his offer.
