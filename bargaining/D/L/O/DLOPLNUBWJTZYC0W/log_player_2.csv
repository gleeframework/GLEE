Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you 40% this time, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think 70% is a fair compromise 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation has significantly devalued my potential gains. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to ensure I get something."
