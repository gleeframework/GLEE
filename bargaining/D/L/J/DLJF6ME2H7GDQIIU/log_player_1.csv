"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves a small amount for Bob. This is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more money, the inflation effect means that Bob is getting less than he would have in the previous round. This is a good deal for me, as I'm getting closer to my goal of a larger share of the money."
