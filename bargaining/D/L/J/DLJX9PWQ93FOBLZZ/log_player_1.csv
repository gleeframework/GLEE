**Reasoning:**

Although this offer is still slightly in Bob's favor, it's getting dangerously close to the point where accepting is the best option for me. 

* **My Position Worsens:**  The longer this goes on, the less my share is worth due to inflation. Another rejection means risking an even worse offer in the next round. 
* **Bob's Position Worsens Faster:** While I'm hurting from inflation, Bob is hurting more. He's likely getting desperate, which might make him more open to a better deal for me in a potential 5th round, but that's a risky gamble.

This round's offer, while not ideal, prevents further losses from inflation."
