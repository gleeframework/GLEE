"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This way, I'll get 40% and Bob will get 60% of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, Bob's offer is more favorable to me. I'll accept.
