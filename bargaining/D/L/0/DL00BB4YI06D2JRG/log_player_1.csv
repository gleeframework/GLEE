"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. 60/40 split for me this time, but with a bit more fairness in the future. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is suggesting a ""fairer"" future, there's no guarantee of that. Accepting this offer means a worse deal now with only a vague promise of improvement later. It's better to negotiate further and aim for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
