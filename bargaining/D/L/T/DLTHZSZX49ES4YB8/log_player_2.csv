"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's get this done quickly Bob. This is my best offer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a deal where I only get 10% of the money. I'm going to see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""This is a fair deal, Alice.  We both get a significant share, and we can move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to be generous, Bob, but this is my final offer. Time is running out for you. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation is hurting me significantly. It's better to take the 3000 now than risk getting nothing in future rounds."
