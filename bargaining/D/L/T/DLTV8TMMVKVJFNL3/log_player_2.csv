Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money!  I'll take a slightly smaller cut to end this now. It's a fair deal, and we both come out ahead before inflation hurts you more. 
# Bob gain: 300000

{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, and we both walk away with a significant sum. Otherwise, inflation will just keep eating away at the pot, hurting me more than you.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering a compromise. This is a significant amount for both of us, and it avoids the risk of further inflation shrinking your share. Let's be pragmatic and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

At this point, accepting is the most rational choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The longer the game continues, the less Bob's potential share is worth. Accepting Alice's offer now guarantees him a decent sum, even if it's less than he ideally wanted.
* **Downward Trend:** Alice's offers have been getting progressively worse for Bob. There's no guarantee she'll offer a better deal in the future.  
* **Uncertainty:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's a risk Alice will become even more demanding in the next round, leaving him with even less. 

While $350,000 is significantly less than Alice's share, it's better than risking further losses due to inflation."
