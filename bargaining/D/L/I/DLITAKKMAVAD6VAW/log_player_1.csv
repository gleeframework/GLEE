Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""

# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to drive a hard bargain!

Considering the offer, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
