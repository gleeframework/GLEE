I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems fair, as I am the one making the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000} 
``` 

I'm offering a 72/28 split in my favor. Since Bob rejected my initial offer and now proposed an even worse split for me, I am increasing my offer to 72% while still maintaining a substantial advantage."
