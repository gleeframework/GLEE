"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. While Bob is offering a slightly better deal than the 50-50 split I initially proposed, he's still getting a larger share of the money. Considering the inflation, his gain is worth 20% less than it would have been in the first round, but it's still a larger share.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the fact that Bob's gain is worth 20% less with each round, and I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share to account for inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much ground 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! I'll analyze Bob's new offer. With the increasing inflation, Bob's gain is now worth 48.8% less than it would have been in the first round, which is a significant decrease. Considering this, his offer of 55% seems a bit stingy.

I'll decide to reject this offer as well and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the accelerating inflation and tries to account for Bob's decreasing bargaining power. Since Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bigger share to account for the inflation, but I'm still open to negotiation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give up too much more 
# Alice gain: 58 
# Bob gain: 42 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With his gain worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I think he's getting desperate. Considering my own gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to give me an even better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the extreme inflation and tries to maximize my gain. Since Bob's gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round, I'll aim to get a significantly larger share to compensate for the loss in value.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 80,
