60.0,40.0,Let's split the money 60/40.  I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation rate.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. Let's be a little more equitable this time. How about this split?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more than you. I'm offering you 45 which is more than you would've gotten last round.  It's a good deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, it seems like we're at an impasse. This back and forth isn't benefiting either of us with inflation eating away at our potential gains. Let's settle this fairly with a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
