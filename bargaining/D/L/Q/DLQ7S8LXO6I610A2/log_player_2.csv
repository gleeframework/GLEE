"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for both of us to settle early. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but we need to find a middle ground. This offer is a compromise considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is attempting to compromise, the deal is still worse than her initial offer after accounting for inflation. It's likely she's feeling the pressure of her decreasing share more strongly.  I'll hold out for a slightly better offer in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. This offer is a slight adjustment from my previous one, reflecting the urgency of reaching an agreement.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

-  **Acknowledging the pressure:** Alice's offer in Round 3 suggests she's feeling the impact of the steeper inflation on her end.
- **Slight concession:** By reducing my share slightly from the Round 2 offer, I signal a willingness to compromise. 
- **Maintaining firmness:** However, the offer still leans in my favor, given my lower inflation rate. 
- **Urgency:** Emphasizing the time constraint encourages a quicker decision from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We both lose with every round.  Let's be reasonable and split the difference. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

- **Shift in Alice's tone:**  Her message suggests frustration and a genuine desire to finalize the deal. 
- **Favorable split:** While technically I ""lose"" in this scenario, the impact of inflation is beginning to significantly outweigh the potential gains from holding out for a slightly better deal. 
- **Risk of losing it all:** With each passing round, the potential winnings decrease drastically for both of us. It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk walking away with nothing."
