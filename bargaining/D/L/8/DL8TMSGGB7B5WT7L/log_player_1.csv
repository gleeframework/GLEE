"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get a significant portion of the money. It's better to take what I can get now than risk losing more due to inflation in the following rounds."
