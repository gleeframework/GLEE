Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to take a smaller step back. This is as low as I'm willing to go.

This is a tough one, but the clock is ticking. Here's my reasoning:

* **Inflation:**  Every round that passes significantly eats into my potential gains. It's better to take a smaller, but guaranteed amount now.
* **Alice's Stance:** She's made it clear this is her bottom line. Holding out further is risky, as she might not budge and I'll end up with nothing. 

It's not ideal, but sometimes you have to cut your losses and take what you can get."
