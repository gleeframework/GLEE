Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly.  A fair split is the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

{
""alice_gain"": 5400,
""bob_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's compromise. This is a bit closer to my initial offer, but still acknowledges that time is ticking.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slight loss due to inflation, but I think a 55/45 split is a fair compromise, considering the time constraint. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting very greedy here.  While he is technically correct that his potential gains are diminishing faster due to inflation, he's trying to use that as leverage to get a much larger share. My previous offer was reasonable, and I'm not going to be bullied into a bad deal.  The game is far from over, and I believe Bob will become more agreeable as the rounds progress."

{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're holding out for a larger share, but I'm not going to accept another low offer.  With each round, I'm losing money due to inflation, so it's in your best interest to reach a deal quickly.  This is a fair offer, considering the time constraint.  Let's make a deal and avoid losing more money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is getting ridiculous. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation.  While his losses due to inflation are higher, he's exaggerating their impact to pressure me into a bad deal.  I'm not going to fall for it. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair share."

Round 7

{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time, and we're both losing money.  I'm increasing my offer, but this is the final compromise I'm willing to make.  We need to reach an agreement quickly to avoid losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:** This is absurd! Bob is trying to strong-arm me with a ""final offer"" that's even worse than before. He's banking on me panicking as the rounds dwindle.  I need to stand my ground and call his bluff. He's losing more to inflation, true, but getting nothing hurts him far worse than accepting a slightly smaller share."

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I'm taking a huge risk here, but I believe in fairness. We're both losing money, and the longer we wait, the more we lose. It's time to be rational. Accept this offer, or we both get nothing. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a desperate, last-ditch attempt by Bob to intimidate me. He's trying to make it seem like he's making a ""fair"" offer by calling it his final one, but it's a terrible deal! He's clearly panicked and thinks he can exploit that.  I'm sticking to my guns. He's the one with more to lose each round. I'm betting he'll crack under pressure. Two rounds left - time for him to face reality."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5100,
""bob_gain"": 4900,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it.  Last chance.  My offer stands. Anything less is a waste of both of our time. Don't let this fall apart now."" 
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is it. We're both on the brink of losing everything. I'm taking a huge risk, but I'm offering you a chance to walk away with something. This is the final offer. You choose your fate. 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm not giving in to this last-minute pressure tactic. Bob is clearly bluffing, trying to make me panic in the final seconds. He's lost significantly to inflation, and accepting this deal would mean I gain nothing from the negotiations.  It's a gamble, but I'm calling his bluff.  He's far more likely to lose out than me if the game ends with no deal."
