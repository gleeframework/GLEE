Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, hoping to secure most of the money early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers.  It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing.  Inflation is a factor, and Bob's offer, though not ideal, is still a decent amount of money."
