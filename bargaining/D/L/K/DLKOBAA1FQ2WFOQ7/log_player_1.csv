"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any potential disputes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my potential gain, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as the previous one, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 5% inflation that has already occurred. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a larger share in the hopes of reaching a deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42.5 
# Bob gain: 57.5 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is starting to hurt! My potential gain is decreasing rapidly. Considering the current offer, I'll accept it. It's not ideal, but it's better than nothing, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting even less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
