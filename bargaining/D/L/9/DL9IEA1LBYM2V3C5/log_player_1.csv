"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  I'm aiming for a fair split, but recognizing that I need to keep Bob somewhat happy to ensure he doesn't reject the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly to try and incentivize him to accept. While the inflation hurts me, I still need to keep him engaged enough to avoid a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable. While I'm losing value with each round, I believe I can still get a better deal if I keep rejecting. I'm aiming to get a larger share of the money, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm making another small increase to my offer to Bob, hoping to find a compromise.  However, I'm still pushing for a larger share as inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money I'm receiving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I am losing a significant amount due to inflation, I am now at a point where Bob's offer is the best I am likely to get. Given the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree, accepting this 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this stage."
