"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 60/40. I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation rate will affect me more than you. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer considering your higher inflation rate.  Let's make this quick, and avoid further losses from inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, but I'm aiming for a more balanced outcome. This 55/45 split considers the inflation impact on both of us. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's try to get closer to a 60/40 split, as the inflation is impacting Alice more significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. A 55/45 split acknowledges the inflation disparity while still ensuring a fair outcome for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value quickly.  This offer is a compromise that still leans in your favor given the inflation difference.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's getting risky to keep rejecting.  While I prefer a higher split, accepting this minimizes our losses from inflation."
