"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take 1/4, I'll take the rest. It's a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $250,000 is actually worth 90% of the original $250,000, which is $225,000. It's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, so I need to make a more aggressive offer to make up for the lost value. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% and take the rest. It's a fair deal, considering the inflation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of the money's value."
