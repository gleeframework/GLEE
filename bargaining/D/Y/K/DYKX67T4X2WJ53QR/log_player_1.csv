"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim to maximize my gain. Bob's offer gives me $300,000, which is a significant reduction from the initial $500,000 I proposed.

However, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm proposing a 40/60 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share to try to get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the drastic reduction in the value of money, I'm getting desperate to get a deal done. Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I think I can do worse.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
