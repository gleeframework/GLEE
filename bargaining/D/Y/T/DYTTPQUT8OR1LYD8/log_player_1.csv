"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fair split, but I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Analyze the current offer from Bob
Bob is offering a split where he takes $6000 and I take $4000, with the message that he thinks 60-40 is a fair split but is willing to negotiate.

### Step 2: Consider the effects of inflation on the current offer
Since we are in Round 2, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. This means the actual value of the money for me is $4000 * 0.95 = $3800, and for Bob is $6000 * 0.90 = $5400.

### Step 3: Evaluate if accepting the offer is beneficial
Considering the adjusted values due to inflation, Bob's offer seems less favorable to me since I would be getting less than what I initially proposed, and the value of the money has decreased.

### Step 4: Decide on the course of action
Given that I initially proposed a 60-40 split in my favor and considering the effects of inflation, accepting Bob's offer of a 60-40 split in his favor after inflation adjustment does not seem like the best option for me. Therefore, I should reject the offer and proceed to the next round to make a new proposal.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the current value of the money after inflation
Since we are in Round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than the original amount (5% less in each of the two rounds), and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than the original amount (10% less in each of the two rounds).

### Step 2: Calculate the adjusted value of the money
For me, the original $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.90 = $9,000. For Bob, the original $10,000 is now worth $10,000 * 0.80 = $8,000.

### Step 3: Decide on a new proposal considering the adjusted values
Given the adjusted values and considering my initial proposal, I should aim for a split that still favors me but is more acceptable to Bob, given the decreasing value of the money. Aiming for a compromise, I could propose a split closer to 55-45 in my favor, considering the original values, to account for the loss in value due to inflation.

### Step 4: Calculate the actual amounts for the proposal
Based on the original $10,000, a 55-45 split would give me $5,500 and Bob $4,500.

### Step 5: Formulate the proposal and message
The proposal will be for me to gain $5,500 and Bob to gain $4,500, with a message encouraging acceptance due to the decreasing value of the money over rounds.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the money's decreasing value, let's settle on a 55-45 split before we both lose more.""}"
