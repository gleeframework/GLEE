I'm proposing to take 9000 dollars and leave Bob with 1000 dollars. I figure it's a fair starting point, considering we have 12 rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not the ideal outcome, it's better than risking a further decrease in Bob's gains due to inflation, which could lead to him rejecting further offers.  It's a fair split, and it's a good strategy to secure something now rather than risk getting nothing in the end."
