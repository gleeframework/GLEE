60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I think it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial outcome.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think a more equitable split is in order. Let's try 55/45, with a bit more for me to reflect the fact that you'll be taking a bigger hit with the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's call it even.  I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to move forward given the inflation we're both experiencing.  It's a good compromise to ensure we both come out with a decent share.,Alice,3,
