Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equitable split is in order. Let's try 55/45, with a bit more for me to reflect the fact that you'll be taking a bigger hit with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
