"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a significant gain for me, but I can do better. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% inflation that has occurred so far. Since the money is worth less, I'll ask for a bit more.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 45, but I think I'm being generous considering the inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 42, but I think I'm being fair considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer of 42 is actually a relatively good deal for me. I'll accept the offer to end the game.
