Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. In this round, my gain of 2,000$ is worth 80% of what it would have been in the previous round, and Bob's gain of 8,000$ is worth 90% of what it would have been in the previous round.

Considering this, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.
