Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think 80/20 is a more reasonable split, considering the initial offer was already skewed in your favor. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
