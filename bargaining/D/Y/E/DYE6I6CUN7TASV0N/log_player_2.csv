Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. An even split is the only fair solution at this point. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The money is losing value quickly for both players, but especially for Alice. Every round that passes makes her previous offers (which favored her) less appealing.
* **Reaching the Midpoint:** A 50/50 split represents the ""fairness"" equilibrium.  It's unlikely Alice will accept anything less favorable to her, especially as time runs out.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to reject offers in the hopes of getting slightly more is a risky gamble.  Bob could end up with nothing if they don't reach an agreement in time."
