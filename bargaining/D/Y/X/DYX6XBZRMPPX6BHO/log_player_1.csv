"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm proposing a 51/49 split in my favor. I figure it's a fair starting point, and since I'm the one making the proposal, it's natural for me to get a slightly larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split,  accepting this offer is the best strategy.  My share is lower, but the inflation means that rejecting this offer and making a counter proposal in the next round will likely lead to a worse outcome for me."
