"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small chunk 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take the majority, but I'm not sure if it's worth it. Considering the inflation, the 2000 I'll get is still worth 80% of the 5000 I could have gotten in the first round, which is a decent chunk. On the other hand, Bob's getting 8000, which is only 80% of 10,000, so he's not getting the majority he's asking for.

I'll accept this offer.
