"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair share for both of us 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, but this needs to be worthwhile for me too. This is my final offer.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money decreases for Bob with each round. It's crucial to secure a deal quickly.
* **Finality:** Presenting this as a ""final offer"" creates a sense of urgency and may encourage Alice to accept rather than risk getting a worse deal in a later round (when the money is worth even less to Bob). 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** While this offer favors Bob more than Alice's initial offer, it's not drastically different. This makes it more likely for Alice to perceive it as a reasonable counter-offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me halfway! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The value of waiting any further is quickly diminishing for Bob. While this offer isn't ideal, accepting now is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds where the money will be worth even less."
