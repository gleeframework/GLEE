"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we both want to maximize our gains. I'm willing to take a smaller share now to avoid the risk of getting nothing later. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
