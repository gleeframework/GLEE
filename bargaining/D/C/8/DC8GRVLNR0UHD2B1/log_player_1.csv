"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates are different for Alice and Bob.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial offer, even taking into account the inflation. I'm willing to see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my share slightly, knowing that Bob's money is losing value at a faster rate than mine. This is a reasonable compromise given the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a lower amount than I initially offered, it is a better deal than the previous round with the current inflation rates.  It's likely I won't get a better offer if I continue to reject."
