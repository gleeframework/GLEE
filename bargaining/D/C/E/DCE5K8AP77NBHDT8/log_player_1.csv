{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me taking 90% and Bob taking 10%.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it's a lot of money, it's still less than what I could have gotten in the first round. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me taking 80% and Bob taking 20%.  I'm willing to compromise a bit from my initial offer, but I'm confident this is still a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it's a lot of money, it's still less than what I could have gotten in the first round.  It's starting to get risky with the inflation, but I think I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me taking 70% and Bob taking 30%. This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will realize it's in his best interest to accept before the inflation gets even worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision. I'm getting a lot less than I initially hoped for, and we're running out of time. But with the inflation, the money is worth significantly less now. Accepting this offer at least ensures I get something."
