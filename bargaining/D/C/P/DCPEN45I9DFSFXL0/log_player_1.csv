"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60/40, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation affects you more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think a 60/40 split is still too skewed towards him, considering the inflation affects me more. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the changing value of money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve more!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the 20% decrease in value of the money I gain, so I'm proposing a 45/55 split in my favor."
