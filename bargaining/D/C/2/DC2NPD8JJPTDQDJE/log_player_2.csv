"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous today, Bob. Let's split it 90/10. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a 90/10 split.  I'll see what Alice's next offer is."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I propose we split the money 55/45.  It's a fairer deal than your last offer, and I'm sure we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical.  We both need to compromise.  I'm willing to accept a 55/45 split, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, Alice's offer is a fair compromise considering the inflation and the fact that I have to factor in the risk of her rejecting my next offer."
