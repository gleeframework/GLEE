Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're getting anxious, but 56-44 is still not good enough for me. How about we meet at 57-43? 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the offer is getting closer to something acceptable, Alice is clearly trying to exploit the time pressure and inflation working against Bob. Accepting now would mean a significant loss compared to what Bob could have gotten in the first round. It's worth risking another round to see if Alice will move closer to a 50/50 split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 460000,
""alice_gain"": 540000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  54-46 is my final offer.  Take it or leave it - we're running out of time.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for Bob. It's crucial to reach an agreement quickly.
* **Strong Stance:** By presenting this as a final offer, Bob asserts his position and might incentivize Alice to accept rather than risk getting nothing.
* **Slight Concession:** Bob is still making a small concession from his previous offer to signal a willingness to compromise, but not by much. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing gains and mitigating the risks posed by inflation and time constraints."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said 54-46 was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. The clock is ticking, and inflation is killing your share. I'll take 59-41. 
# Bob gain: 410000 
# Alice gain: 590000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, and the situation is becoming increasingly dire for Bob. While 59-41 isn't ideal, consider these factors:

* **Severe Inflation:**  The value of the money is plummeting rapidly for Bob. Waiting any longer could result in an even worse deal or nothing at all.
* **Alice's Strategy:** She's clearly aware of the pressure Bob is under and is unlikely to budge significantly from her last offer. 
* **Something is Better than Nothing:** Accepting a smaller share now is better than risking a total loss in the later rounds.

It's a tough pill to swallow, but accepting at this point is the most logical choice given the circumstances."
