"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and equality, hoping that he will accept this offer and we can conclude the game early. Since the money's value decreases by 10% for me with each round, I'm starting with a slightly higher offer for myself to account for potential future losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better.  Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, although the split is even in terms of nominal value, due to the 10% decrease in value for me, I would effectively be getting less than half the original value. I need to make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good compromise""}\n\nIn this offer, I've reduced my share from the initial 60% to 55%, trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept. Given the inflation, I'm effectively offering a bit more to Bob in terms of value compared to the first round, while still trying to maximize my gain. The message aims to convey that I'm willing to compromise but also aware of the impact of inflation on my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. This is a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (27.1% less than the original), Bob's offer of $450,000 to me and $550,000 to himself starts to look more reasonable. The fact that Bob acknowledges the inflation in his message suggests he is trying to find a mutually acceptable solution. Given the decreasing value of the money for me with each round, accepting this offer seems like the best option to secure a significant amount before the value drops further."
