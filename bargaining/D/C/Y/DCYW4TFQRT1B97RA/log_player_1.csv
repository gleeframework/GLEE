Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's keep it simple and split it evenly, Alice. 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, time is money, and it's losing value for me. I'll take a slightly smaller cut at 52% to settle this now.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:** I need to emphasize that time is working against me due to inflation.  
* **Compromise:** I've lowered my initial ask from 55% to 52% to show a willingness to negotiate.
* **Staying above 50%:** It's important to stay above a 50/50 split, considering Bob's lack of urgency and my diminishing returns."
