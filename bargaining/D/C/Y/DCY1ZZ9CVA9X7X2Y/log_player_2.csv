**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate as the value of her potential winnings plummets.  We're now at a point where accepting her offer means I gain nothing compared to the original ""fair"" offer in Round 1, but she's losing a significant chunk of her potential earnings. It's highly likely she'll crack in the next round and offer an even better deal."

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking. Take this offer before the money shrinks even further.""}
