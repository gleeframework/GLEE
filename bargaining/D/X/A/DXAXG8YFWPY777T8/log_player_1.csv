"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively even split, but I'm not giving away too much in the first round."

Round 2

# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential earnings.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Meeting in the middle is a reasonable proposal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need a bit more for myself to make it worth my while.""
}
```"

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up yet 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is taking its toll, and my potential earnings are decreasing rapidly.

I'll consider Bob's offer. It's a slight increase from his previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough to accept.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is getting intense!

Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money even further, I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get a better deal than this. I'm willing to take a slightly higher risk to get more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns!

Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money by almost half, I'm starting to get desperate. However, Bob's offer is the same as his previous one, and I'm not sure if I can do better.
