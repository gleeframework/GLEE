"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

I want to see what kind of offer Alice will make in the next round. I don't know how inflation affects her, so I'm not ready to accept a 60/40 split just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it evenly.  I'm confident we can reach a good outcome if we keep negotiating.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share since I'm taking on more risk 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'm accepting this offer. Alice's offer is slightly better than the even split, and the inflation is starting to affect her share more. It's a good compromise and a decent outcome for me."
