Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. It's the fairest option.

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than your last offer. Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for him.  While this offer is better than his last, I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round as the pressure mounts on Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 650000,
""bob_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""This is it, Bob.  Last chance to get a decent deal. The next offer will be much less appealing for you.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from Round 3 to give the illusion of compromise. However, I'm also making it clear that time is running out for Bob and the next offer will be much worse for him. This puts the pressure on him to accept a deal that's still heavily in my favor."
