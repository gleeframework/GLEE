"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 4/6 is a good compromise, considering the initial value of the money. It's not too far off from your initial offer, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
