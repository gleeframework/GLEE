"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll lower my initial offer a bit, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""This doesn't seem fair to either of us. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you closer to the middle, but I still think I have the upper hand 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is working against me. It's better to hold out a bit longer and hope she becomes more agreeable to a fairer split as the rounds progress. Accepting now would mean losing out significantly due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this soon. This is slightly in your favor, but it's the best I can offer considering the time crunch and inflation.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The game is reaching a critical point.  I need to signal a willingness to compromise but also convey the urgency of the situation. Offering slightly more than a 50/50 split might entice Alice while still securing a decent amount for myself before inflation eats further into the potential gains."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is really hurting your share, let's settle this before it's too late for you 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is right, inflation is killing me. While this offer isn't ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point. If I reject it, the remaining rounds will see my potential gains dwindle even further. It's better to take a less-than-ideal offer now than risk getting even less later or even nothing at all if we run out of rounds."
