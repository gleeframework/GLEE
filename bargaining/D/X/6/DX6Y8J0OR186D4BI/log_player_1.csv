"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""} \n\nMy proposal is for me to take $6000 and Bob to take $4000. I've included a message to Bob saying ""Let's be fair!"" to convey that this is a reasonable and equitable division. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the proposal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response! \n\n###\n\n(Remember, if Bob rejects the proposal, the money will be worth 10% less in the next round.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the money is worth 10% less now, I'm willing to take the risk to try to get a larger share.\n\n###\n\nNow it's my turn again! Here's my next proposal:\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nI'm proposing that I take $5800 and Bob takes $4200, with a message suggesting that we compromise and meet in the middle.
