# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to find an agreement soon. I'm offering you 4800, which is more than you'd get with the current inflation if we wait much longer. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is getting more reasonable.  At this point, given the inflation, I'm not sure I'll get a better deal, so I'll accept."
