5500.0,4500.0,"I understand the inflation affects me more, but your previous offer was too low. Let's meet in the middle - this split considers the time pressure and is still fair.",Alice,3,

4500.0,5500.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to make sure I get a fair share.  Let's split it 55/45, which acknowledges the inflation and allows us both to get something.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Bob, we need to find an agreement soon. I'm offering you 4800, which is more than you'd get with the current inflation if we wait much longer. Let's be reasonable and close this deal.",Alice,5,
