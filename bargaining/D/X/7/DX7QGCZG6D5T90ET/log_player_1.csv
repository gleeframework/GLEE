I propose to take 900,000$ and give Bob 100,000$. I believe this is a fair offer as it gives a significant share to Bob while ensuring I get the majority of the money."

# Bob gain: 700000

Bob's offer is getting better, but it's still not fair for me considering the amount of money I will lose due to inflation.  I believe I can still get a better offer."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting close, but I still believe I can do better. The inflation is getting increasingly serious, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small share yet. I will try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, Bob's offer is the best I've seen so far.  It's a 50/50 split, and any further negotiation risks ending up with nothing."
