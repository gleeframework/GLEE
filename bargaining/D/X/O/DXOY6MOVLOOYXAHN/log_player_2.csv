Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. 50/50 is the fairest split, especially considering the value of our money is shrinking with each round.  Accept this and we both get a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
