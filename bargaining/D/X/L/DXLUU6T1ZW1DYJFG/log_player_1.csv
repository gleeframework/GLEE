Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking 9000 dollars for myself and giving Bob 1000. This seems like a fair first offer, as it ensures I get the majority of the money while still giving Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While Bob is getting the majority of the money, the inflation means that my share is worth significantly less than in the previous round. I'm willing to negotiate further to secure a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm proposing a 5500/4500 split. This is a compromise from my previous offer, but still secures me a majority of the money while giving Bob a fair share considering the inflation."
