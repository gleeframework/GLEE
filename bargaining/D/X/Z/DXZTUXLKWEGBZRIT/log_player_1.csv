"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my strategy considering the inflation. My offer in the first round was already a relatively generous one, and Bob's offer in the second round is even more generous, taking into account the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
