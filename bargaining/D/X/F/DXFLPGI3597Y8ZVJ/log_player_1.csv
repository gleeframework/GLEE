"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively generous starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best option for me. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% * 80% = 64%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away all the value. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, while still being somewhat generous. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share. Let's try to find a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%).

Considering Bob's new offer, I think I can do slightly better. I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 40.96% of what it was in the first round (100% - 48.8% - 8% = 40.96%, because 20% * 20% = 4% and 4% + 4.8% = 8%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not budging from here. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm mirroring Bob's previous offer, trying to find a compromise."
