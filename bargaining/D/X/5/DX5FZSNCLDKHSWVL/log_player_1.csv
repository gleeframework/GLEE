"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a simple and straightforward way to convey that the offer is a reasonable and equitable split. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I want to make a strong initial offer to try to conclude the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split the money evenly. Let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer. Although he says he's happy to split the money evenly, his offer actually gives him $6000 and me only $4000. Considering the money is already worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'd be getting significantly less value than Bob. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $5000 and keep $5000 for myself. Considering the money is now worth 40% less for me than in the first round, I'm actually offering Bob a larger share of the original value. The message ""Let's meet in the middle"" is a way to convey that I'm trying to find a compromise and meet Bob halfway, despite the fact that the money is losing value for me.\n{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###"
