"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I think 60/40 is a good place to begin. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for my turn to make a proposal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try 55/45, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI made an offer that is slightly favorable to me, taking into account the 5% decrease in value for me and 10% decrease for Alice. Waiting for Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time, given the inflation.  A 50/50 split is the fairest way forward. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The value of the money is decreasing more for Alice than for me, so I'll wait for my turn again."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation impact, 58/42 seems reasonable""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the decreasing value of money, especially for Alice, I've adjusted my offer to reflect this change while still trying to find a mutually acceptable split. Waiting for Alice's response."
