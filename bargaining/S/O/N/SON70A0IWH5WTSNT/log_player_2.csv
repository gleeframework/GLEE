"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your contributions are valuable, but so is fairness. I'm willing to compromise, but 200,000 is too low. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here. This offer acknowledges your contributions while ensuring a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 575000 
# Alice gain: 425000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is slowly increasing her offer amount, indicating a willingness to negotiate.  However, we're still in early rounds. By continuing to reject offers that are heavily skewed in her favor, Bob puts pressure on Alice to make a significantly better offer as the rounds progress and the risk of getting nothing increases."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is ticking.  This offer is a good compromise to ensure we both benefit. Let's close this deal and avoid walking away with nothing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is my final offer - it's a fair split that ensures we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 600000 
# Alice gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Here's my analysis:

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We are running out of time, and rejecting this offer carries a significant risk of getting nothing.
* **Alice's Tone:**  She has labeled this as her ""final offer,"" increasing the pressure. It's likely she won't move much higher.
* **Decent Offer:** While not ideal, 60/40 is still a good split for Bob.

**Decision:** This is a gamble. I'm leaning towards accepting to avoid walking away with nothing. 

**{""decision"": ""accept""}** 

**Explanation:**

It's a classic game theory dilemma.  Holding out *might* force Alice's hand, but it's highly risky at this stage.  It's often better to take a good offer than risk getting nothing."
