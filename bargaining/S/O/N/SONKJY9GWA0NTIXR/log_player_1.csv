"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob each round, I'll try to maximize my gain. I'll accept Bob's offer.
