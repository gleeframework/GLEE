"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. I'll give you 20, and I'll take 80. We can discuss more in the next round if you want.""
}
```

I'm starting with a relatively generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer this time. Let's see if you'll accept it! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain is worth 5% less than the previous round, so I'll be getting $70.50 (80 x 0.875).

I'll think for a moment... Bob's offer is a bit better than mine, but I'm still not sure if I want to accept it. I'll reject it for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain will be $64.25 (70 x 0.913).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle with 60 for me and 40 for you. It's a fair split, and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really kicking in! My gain is now worth $54.35 (60 x 0.893).

I'll think for a moment... Bob's offer is a bit better than mine, but I'm still not sure if I want to accept it. I'll reject it for now and try to negotiate further.
