"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and equal to start the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain as 400,000 * 0.8 = 320,000.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money.

Since my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to increase my share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share to account for the increased value of my gain due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual value of the offer considering the inflation:

My gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll calculate it as 450,000 * (1 - 0.488) = 237,000.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
