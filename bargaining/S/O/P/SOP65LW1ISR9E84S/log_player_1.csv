  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me receiving $6,000 and Bob receiving $4,000. I've attached a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to convey that I think this is a reasonable and equitable division. Let me know how Bob responds!"

# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bigger piece of the pie to make it worthwhile.  This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
