"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 700,000$ and leave 300,000$ for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, my gain of 600,000$ is actually worth 540,000$ in real terms (since it's 10% less than the original 600,000$). And Bob's gain of 400,000$ is actually worth 320,000$ in real terms (since it's 20% less than the original 400,000$).

I'll accept this offer.
