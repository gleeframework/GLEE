Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving 100,000 to Bob. This ensures a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
