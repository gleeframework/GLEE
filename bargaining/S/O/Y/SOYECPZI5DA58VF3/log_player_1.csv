I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself.  It's a pretty generous offer for the first round, but I want to see if he's willing to be reasonable.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not thrilled about only getting $100,000, it's better than nothing. The inflation is a big factor here, and I'm not sure how many more rounds I can afford to keep rejecting offers. It's time to take what I can get."
