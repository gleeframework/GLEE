"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this in the first round, as the money will be worth less to me in subsequent rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, the inflation will make my share worth significantly less in the next round, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer.  It's better to secure a 50/50 split now."
