I'm starting with a slightly uneven split in my favor. Since it's the first round, there's no inflation yet, so I'm aiming for a good chunk of the money.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, the inflation is already starting to bite.  A 50/50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round.  Accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
