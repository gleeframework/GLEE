"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### Alice: Round 1\n\nI'll start by proposing a division that seems fair but slightly favorable to me, considering the game's structure and the impact of inflation. Since the money loses value with each round, there's an incentive for Bob to accept a reasonable offer early on. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Fair start, considering future loss.""
}
```

This division gives me a slightly larger share, but it still offers Bob a significant amount. The message aims to convey that this offer is reasonable, especially when considering the diminishing value of the money in subsequent rounds. It encourages Bob to accept this offer to avoid further loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. No point in fighting over a shrinking pie. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Alice: Round 2\n\nConsidering Bob's offer and the impact of inflation, I must weigh the pros and cons of accepting this proposal. On one hand, accepting now secures a known amount, albeit diminished by 10% due to the first round's inflation. On the other hand, rejecting it could lead to a potentially better offer in the next round but at the risk of further devaluation of the money.

Given that Bob is offering an even split, which seems fair and acknowledges the shrinking value of the money, it might be prudent to accept this offer. The rationale behind accepting is that further rounds could lead to a more significant loss due to inflation, potentially making this the most valuable offer I'll receive in terms of real value.

Therefore, I decide to accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
