Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty aggressive offer, hoping to secure a good chunk of the money early on.  Since the money depreciates each round, I want to maximize my gains as quickly as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is clearly a reversal of my initial offer. While I'm losing out on 5% of the value of my potential gains due to inflation, Bob is losing out on 20% of his. This means it's in my best interest to reject his offer and proceed to the next round, where I can make a new proposal.  The inflation will work in my favor, and I can likely get a better deal than Bob's offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but still aim for a significant portion of the money. The inflation is hitting Bob harder than me, so I'm hoping he'll accept a deal that still favors me."
