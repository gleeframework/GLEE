"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair share considering the risk of inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game in the first round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's start with this and see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the new values are:

* My gain: $4500 (20% less than $8000)
* Bob's gain: $5225 (5% less than $5500)

I'm not too thrilled about giving up $3500, but Bob's message suggests he's open to negotiation. I'll try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is a bit too generous for me. I'll think about it and make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you most of the money, but I need to get something for myself. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
