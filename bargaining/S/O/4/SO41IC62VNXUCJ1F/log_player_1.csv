"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50, you take 50. It's a fair split, and we can end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
