"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small amount ($1000) and keeping the majority for myself ($9000). I'm hoping he'll be willing to accept this offer, as it's better than nothing. Since we have 12 rounds, I want to secure a large portion of the money early on, before inflation starts to take effect."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $1000, I know that the inflation will make the money I get less valuable in the future. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the upcoming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to $8000, while still offering Bob a significant portion ($2000). The inflation is starting to impact the value of the money, but I believe this offer is still fair and appealing to Bob, especially considering that he rejected my previous offer. I'm aiming to secure a good portion of the money early on while being flexible enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $2000 is better than nothing, the inflation has reduced the value of this offer significantly.  It's not worth accepting a deal that gives me such a small portion of the money, especially since we still have several rounds left. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can secure a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer this time, hoping to find a middle ground.  With the inflation taking a bigger bite out of the money with each round, I need to secure a good amount, but also be realistic about Bob's needs. I'm aiming to secure at least 70% of the money while offering Bob a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While $3000 is better than nothing, it's still a significantly small portion of the money, especially after the heavy inflation. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still aiming for a substantial portion of the money. We're getting closer to the end, and the inflation is hitting hard. I'm hoping this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, as it's likely to be better than what he could get in the remaining rounds."
