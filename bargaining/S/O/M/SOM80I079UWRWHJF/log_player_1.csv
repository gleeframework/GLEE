"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I receive 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob receives 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80, you get 20, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, the 20 I would get in this offer is equivalent to 18.5% of the initial $100, which is $18.5.

On the other hand, Bob's gain of 80 is worth 16% of the initial $100, which is $16.

Considering the offers, I'm not thrilled with this proposal. I was hoping to get a bit more than 18.5%. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, I'll take 55, it's a fair compromise""}

I'm proposing that I receive 55% of the initial $100, which is $55, and Bob receives 45%, which is $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting low, I'll take 70, you get 30, it's my last offer 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer carefully.

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, the 30 I would get in this offer is equivalent to 26.34% of the initial $100, which is $26.34.

On the other hand, Bob's gain of 70 is worth 28.8% of the initial $100, which is $28.8.

Considering the offers, I'm not thrilled with this proposal. I was hoping to get a bit more than 26.34%. I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will come back with a better proposal.
