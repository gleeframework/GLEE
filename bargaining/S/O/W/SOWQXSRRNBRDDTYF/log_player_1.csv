"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust later if needed.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share this round, but I'm still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to make a better deal in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
