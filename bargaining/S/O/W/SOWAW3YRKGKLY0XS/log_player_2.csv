"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, Bob. Take this small amount and let's get this over with. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not sure what's going on with inflation, but taking only $10,000 is a terrible deal.  I'll see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. This offer is fair and leaves room for negotiation in the future rounds.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share. Let's meet in the middle this time. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is a much better offer than the first round, I still believe we can both do better. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""This offer is more balanced and reflects the value of our time. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""}
