"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

This offer gives me $9,000 and Bob gets $1,000. I'm starting with a strong offer, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. I'm sure we can both agree that's the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks it's fair to split it evenly, huh? I'm not so sure...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than a 50/50 split. I'll hold out for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, my offer will be slightly less valuable than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8200,
  ""bob_gain"": 1800,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous with the even split idea. I think I deserve a bit more for being the first to make a move.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,200 and Bob gets $1,800. I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that I made the first offer!"

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more for taking the initiative, huh? I'm not convinced...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I think 60/40 is a bit too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll keep pushing for a better deal!"

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting to think you're not serious about a fair split. I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","70/30 is still a bit too skewed in Bob's favor, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll hold out for a better deal, but I'm not sure how much longer I can afford to wait. The money is worth less and less with each passing round!"

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","80/20 is getting close to desperation territory for me...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to give in to such a lopsided deal, especially with the money being worth so much less due to inflation. I'll keep pushing for a better offer, but I'm running out of time..."
