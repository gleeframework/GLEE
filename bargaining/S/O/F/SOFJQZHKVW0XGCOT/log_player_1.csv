"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll get the bigger share""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original amount, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the middle ground, let's split it 3:2 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 3:2 split, I'd like to try to get a better deal."

  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55:45 split""

This way, I'll get a slightly larger share, but still a bit less than the original 4:1 ratio I proposed in round 1."
