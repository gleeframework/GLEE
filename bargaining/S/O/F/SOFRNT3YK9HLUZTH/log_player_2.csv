"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me with each passing round, I'm motivated to reach an agreement quickly. However, I believe I can negotiate a better split. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nIn this round, I'll aim for a more favorable split while considering the impact of inflation on both of us. Since Alice is less affected by inflation, she might be more willing to negotiate. Here's my proposal:
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this split is more reasonable. It's a compromise that slightly favors me but still offers you a substantial amount.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is hitting you harder than me. Let's be realistic - this offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the inflation is indeed impacting me more significantly, I still believe there's room for negotiation. Given the decreasing value of the money, it's crucial to secure the best possible deal. Alice's offer is slightly better than her initial one, but I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to achieve a more favorable split. The pressure of the rounds and the impact of inflation on both of us might prompt Alice to be more flexible in her negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","As the game progresses, the pressure of the rounds and the impact of inflation should make both of us more inclined to reach an agreement. Considering Alice's last offer and the current state of the game, I'll make a slightly more conservative proposal to try and meet in the middle. Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Inflation is affecting us both, but I'm willing to find a middle ground. This split is closer to Alice's last offer but still acknowledges my initial proposal. Let's compromise and secure our gains before the money loses more value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and this is a fair offer considering the circumstances.  Let's settle this now and walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, with the money now worth 59.04% less than in the first round, the pressure to reach an agreement is mounting. Alice's offer of $4300, although not ideal, is still a substantial amount considering the current state of the game. The risk of proceeding to further rounds and potentially ending up with nothing due to the inability to reach an agreement outweighs the potential benefits of holding out for a slightly better offer. It's time to accept the offer and secure the gains before the value of the money decreases further."
