"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a significant sum. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent sum, I believe I can get a better deal with more rounds of negotiation. The money will be worth more to me in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This way, we both get a good share and avoid further risk of inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the sentiment of an even split, but time is working against you more than me. This offer is still generous, considering. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'll reject this offer again.  While Alice's message points to the time constraint, I'm still betting on getting a better deal in the coming rounds. The inflation is affecting her less, so I believe she'll be more motivated to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise further. This offer is closer to your previous proposal, but I believe it's still a fair split given the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  Take it or leave it - the value is shrinking with every passing moment, especially for you. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and I'm running out of time. This offer is still better than the previous one, and the potential loss from further rounds is too high."
