"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can adjust it later if you want. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm going to reject Alice's offer.  While it seems fair at first, I'm not sure I want to accept such a small share at the start, especially with the risk of inflation.  I'm hoping I can get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
