This is a tough one, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Hurts:** Every round, the value of the money decreases significantly for me. Waiting longer means getting even less.
* **Alice is Tough:** She's clearly willing to play hardball and wait me out. There's no guarantee she'll offer anything better.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:**  While not ideal, 4300 is better than risking even less in future rounds if Alice continues to hold out."
