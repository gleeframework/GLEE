"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the $400,000 I would gain in this round is actually worth less than the $500,000 I would have gained in the previous round. Given that Bob is offering a slightly better deal, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You said you'd give me a slightly better deal, so I'm taking a slightly better offer""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of the deal, given that I've rejected Bob's offer twice already."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer, as it's the best one I've seen so far, and I don't want to risk going into further rounds with a decreasing pot value."
