I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  He gets $1,000, but if he rejects it, he has to make an offer and risk losing a lot more in the next round due to inflation. Let's see what he does!"

I'm going to try a slightly less generous offer, but still offering a significant amount to Bob to incentivize him to accept. I'm hoping to get closer to a 90/10 split in my favor, but I need to be careful with inflation!"

This is a tough decision. Inflation is getting worse, but I'm worried that Bob will continue to get greedy and I might end up with nothing.  It's better to take this 50/50 split and secure some money, than risk it all in the next round."
