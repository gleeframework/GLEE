"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I deserve more. You can try to negotiate if you want. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a very lopsided offer, Bob. I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.""
}
```

I'm hoping to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle with a 42-58 split. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal this round.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, but still aiming to get a slightly better share than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up too much more. I think 9:1 is a fairer split, considering the initial offer I made. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll respond with:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""9:1 is way too skewed, Bob. I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, but I'm getting desperate.""
}
```

I'm not sure how much more I can negotiate, but I'll try to squeeze out a slightly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 150000,
  ""bob_gain"": 850000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, Bob. I'll accept a 15-85 split, but I think it's the bare minimum I can accept. Let's finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm trying to get as much as possible, but I'm willing to accept a very uneven split at this point."
