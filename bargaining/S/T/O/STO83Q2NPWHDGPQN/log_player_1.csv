Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I know it's harsh, but inflation is on my side. You're losing value every round, and I'm not. I'm willing to push my advantage. 
# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a tough situation. While accepting Bob's offer means I'm getting a much smaller share, rejecting it means risking even further losses due to inflation. It's clear Bob is willing to drag this out, and the longer we play, the worse the deal gets for me. Accepting a 38/62 split is far from ideal, but it's better than potentially ending up with even less."
