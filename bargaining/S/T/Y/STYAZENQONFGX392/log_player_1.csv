"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 60/40 in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, I'll take a slightly smaller share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the values are now:

Alice's gain: $5,000 (worth 90% of $6,000)
Bob's gain: $4,750 (worth 95% of $5,000)

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation that's affecting my end. I'd like to see a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a slight edge for myself. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the values are now:

Alice's gain: $3,630 (worth 36.3% of $10,000)
Bob's gain: $4,160 (worth 41.6% of $10,000)

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. I think the slight increase in my share is worth it, and I'm willing to compromise to end the game."
