"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a clean slate""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, let's see if you agree 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. He's proposing a 70-30 split, which is quite lopsided in his favor. I was hoping for a more even split, especially since I didn't accept his initial 50-50 proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still think we should split it more evenly""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly better deal, but I'm still holding out for a more balanced split."

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving me enough, I'm taking a bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Oh no, Bob's offer is getting more and more lopsided! With the inflation, my gain is already worth less than in the first round, and now Bob is proposing an 80-20 split. I don't think I can accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65, ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a slightly better deal. This is my final offer""}

I'm willing to give Bob a bigger share, but I'm still trying to hold on to some of the money. This is my final offer, so I hope Bob will accept it."
