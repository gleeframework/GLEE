"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split that benefits both of us. I get the majority since I'm taking the first offer, but there's plenty for you too.  Let's end this on a good note!

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be reasonable - I'm proposing a more equitable split that reflects the fact that we both lose money as time goes on.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a larger share this time, but we need to move quickly to avoid further losses from inflation.  Accept this and we both win. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
 
Even though Alice is offering more, the devaluation of the money makes this offer worse than my previous one.  I need to push for a better split before we both lose too much to inflation."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
