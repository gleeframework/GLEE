75.0,25.0,Let's split it 3:1. It's fair considering the inflation rates.,Alice,1,

60.0,40.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60 is a bit too much for you. I'd like to try to find a better balance.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,I agree with a more balanced distribution. Let's go with 65/35.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
55.0,45.0,I'm still not comfortable with the 65/35 split. I'd like to try to find a compromise that's a bit more in my favor. This 45/55 split seems like a fairer balance to me.,Bob,4,
