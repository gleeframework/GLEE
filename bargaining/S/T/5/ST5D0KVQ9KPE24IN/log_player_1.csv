"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better.  Let's split it evenly this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"",
""message"": ""That's a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm confident we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** While Bob's offer is better than nothing, there are still 10 rounds left.  We are aiming for a better deal.
* **Inflation:** Delaying benefits Bob more than Alice due to the different inflation rates. By rejecting, we increase the pressure on Bob as the value of his potential gains diminishes faster. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Showing a willingness to walk away from a ""decent"" offer can signal to Bob that we are serious about getting a better deal and are not desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's find a compromise. I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's closer to even but still acknowledges my initial offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  We've moved slightly closer to an even split to show Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a 60/40 offer and now proposing 55/45, we're trying to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired outcome. 
* **Time Pressure:** While we're still early in the rounds, the clock is ticking for both of us. This offer maintains some pressure on Bob."
