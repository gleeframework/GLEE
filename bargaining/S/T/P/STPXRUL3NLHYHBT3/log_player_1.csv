"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd like to try to get a bit more to make up for it. However, I don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting the offer again.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less in each round, I'll try to take a bit more this time to compensate for the loss in value.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,

This offer is a bit more skewed in my favor, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

# Bob gain: 70

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"

Round 5
