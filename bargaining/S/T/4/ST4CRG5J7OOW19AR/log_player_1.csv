"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 evenly, with each of us getting $50. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives us a chance to see how the game plays out."
