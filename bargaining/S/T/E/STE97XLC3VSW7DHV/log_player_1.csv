Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script this round. I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation will benefit you more in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
