Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose a 50/50 split to start. It's fair and leaves room for negotiation if Bob is dissatisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me, and while I'm aware of the inflation, a 40/60 split is still not fair. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm willing to compromise by offering a 45/55 split, hoping to find a middle ground."
