"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose to take $9000 and leave Bob with $1000.  This is a fair starting point considering the inflation disadvantage he faces in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm still going to offer a large majority of the money to myself, but I'm reducing my share slightly to account for Bob's reduced purchasing power.  I believe this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a larger share. While Bob's purchasing power is significantly reduced, I still have a strong advantage with the inflation rate in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}
```

I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm still aiming for a significant majority of the money.  Given the increasing inflation disadvantage Bob faces, I believe this is a fair offer that will ensure we both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, the inflation rate is starting to hurt Bob significantly. This offer gives me a decent amount, and the risk of getting nothing is too high if I reject."
