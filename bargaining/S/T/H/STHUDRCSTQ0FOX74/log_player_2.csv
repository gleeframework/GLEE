Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise, I'll take a bit less. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is compromising, she's still taking a significantly larger share. It's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Alice, making her more likely to accept a less favorable deal as time goes on. We can likely push for a better split in the coming rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 505000,
""alice_gain"": 495000,
""message"": ""This offer is very fair considering the circumstances. It's time to agree before the money dwindles further.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer gives Bob a slight edge but is strategically positioned as a ""compromise.""  The message emphasizes fairness and the urgency created by the decreasing value, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
