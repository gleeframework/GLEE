"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll be tempted to accept in the early rounds.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

A 50/50 split is fair and there's no reason to risk getting nothing by rejecting this offer."
