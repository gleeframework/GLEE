"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I propose we split the $100 evenly. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the $100 evenly, I think it's a fair deal, and there's no reason to try to negotiate for more. Accepting this offer ensures that I get $50, which is a reasonable share. Proceeding to the next round may risk getting a worse offer or possibly getting less than $50. Accepting now guarantees a fair outcome."
