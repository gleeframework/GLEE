Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand you want a bit more, but this is a fairer split considering the inflation we face.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous than before 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. I urge you to accept before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm willing to make one more compromise 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is severely impacting Bob's potential gains. While Alice is offering slight compromises, they are not keeping pace with how much value Bob loses each round.  It's still worthwhile for Bob to hold out and counter-offer, aiming for a more equitable split even with the inflation factored in."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to reach an agreement soon. I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share to end this, but it needs to be reasonable for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Each round is costing you more, I'm being generous by not increasing my share further 
# Bob gain: 41 
# Alice gain: 59 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming critical. While the offer isn't ideal, accepting a $41 share now is better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds. Alice is unlikely to offer more favorable terms, and the value of further negotiation is shrinking rapidly with each passing round."
