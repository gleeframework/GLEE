"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your fair split, but I'll take a slight edge. Accept and we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a slight edge, huh?

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to take advantage of the fact that Bob's offer was only a slight edge. Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a slight edge? I'll give you a slight edge, but I'll keep a bit more.""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves room for Bob to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think you're giving me a slight edge? I'll take a bigger one this time. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take a bigger edge! Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to adjust my strategy accordingly. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the value of the money is decreasing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll try to adjust my offer to account for the decreased value. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""You wanted a bigger edge? I'll give it to you, but don't think you're getting the better deal!""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a larger share, but I'm trying to make it seem like I'm giving him a good deal."
