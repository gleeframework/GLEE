"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice a large share, but leaves Bob with something to consider.  Let's see if he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I proposed in the first round, even considering the 5% inflation. I'm not willing to accept such a large reduction in my share so early in the game.  Let's see what I can do in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for inflation, but still offering Bob a decent share.  Hopefully, he'll realize that continuing to reject offers will likely lead to a worse outcome for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me. While inflation is hitting hard, I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to play.  His offers are getting slightly better, but I'm not convinced he's willing to be reasonable yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. Bob is clearly being stubborn, but I'm hoping he'll finally realize that he needs to compromise if he wants to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation is taking a toll, Bob's offer finally seems reasonable.  I'm getting half the money, and it's better than continuing to risk losing everything due to further inflation.  It's time to accept and move on."
