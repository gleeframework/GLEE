I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, given that I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer. While the money is worth less now, I still believe a 80/20 split is fair. I'm willing to concede a bit, but I don't think Bob should expect to take 80% of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with this offer. It's clear that Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in just yet. I'll make my own offer next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try a 60/40 split in my favor. Bob has been pushing for a larger share, but this is still a fair compromise considering the inflation and the fact that I'm the one making the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky, and I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation. I'll take the 400,000, hoping I can make it last."
