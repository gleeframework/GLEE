Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise!  I'll take a bit less this time, but I'm hoping we can agree and end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is devaluing faster for her. While her offer is better than the first, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to push for a more equitable split, especially since I'm not as affected by inflation."

{

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. Let's split the money evenly and call it a day. It's the most sensible way forward considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, accepting a 50/50 split now is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're over halfway through the rounds, and the risk of getting nothing is increasing rapidly. 
* **Devaluation:**  The longer the game continues, the less valuable the money becomes for Alice. This makes her more likely to propose increasingly unfavorable splits, hoping I'll crack under pressure. 
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, while not ideal, is fair on the surface. 

Accepting now guarantees a reasonable outcome and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
