Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a fair chance.  This offer is a 90/10 split in my favor, but it is still a significant share for you.  Let's end this round and split the money. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
