Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, but a 90/10 split is too much in your favor.  I'm proposing a 80/20 split. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation and the fact that I'm offering you more than the previous round. Let's call it a day. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000
