Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need the lion's share.  This is my final offer.  Accept it, or we risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  While the decreasing value of the money is a factor, it's not worth accepting a deal this bad. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer share."

{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a very reasonable 45%.  Take it before inflation eats away at both our shares any further!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my last offer. I'm sticking to my position.  We're running out of time, and I'm not willing to accept less. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, but her ""last offer"" is still unacceptable. She's clearly hoping I'll panic as the rounds dwindle. However, even with the increasing inflation, accepting a mere 20% is a terrible deal. It's a gamble, but I'm confident I can get her to be more reasonable."

{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, enough games. It's clear we both want this money. A 50/50 split is the only fair solution. Let's end this now before we both lose out!""}
