"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take 60 and you take 40. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds. This offer isn't ideal for me with the inflation in play."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""How about a slightly more even split? This considers the inflation we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation affects us both. This offer is a compromise, considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice's offer is now better than what I could hope to get in a later round due to the steep inflation we both face."
