"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game!"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a bit of an uneven split, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not get 30$ if I can get more. I'll reject this offer.
