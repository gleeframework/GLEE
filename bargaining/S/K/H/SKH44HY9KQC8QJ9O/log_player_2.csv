Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob.  I'll take a little less to settle this now. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's be realistic. We're both losing out here. 50/50 is the only fair solution at this point. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is unlikely to offer anything better. While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking another round where:

* **Alice's desperation could lead to a very low offer:** She's losing value much faster. 
* **Even a slightly better offer from Bob in the next round might be rejected, leading to an even worse outcome in round 7.**

It's time to cut losses and secure a reasonable amount.
