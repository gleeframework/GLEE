""alice_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to make a slight concession. 58% for me and 42% for you is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making concessions, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid inflation.  It's better to hold out for a more equitable split, even with the shrinking pot."
