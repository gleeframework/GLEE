"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less now!

Considering the new values, my gain of $500,000 is worth $400,000 in the original amount, and Bob's gain of $500,000 is worth $475,000 in the original amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
