"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also aware of the inflation factor and want to secure a good chunk of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  Inflation is hurting me more than Bob, and I don't want to risk losing even more money by continuing. This is a fair split considering the circumstances."
