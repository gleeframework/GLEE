"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split it 60/40, but I'm open to other fair offers. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm not thrilled about the 40 dollars I'd get. However, Bob's message suggests he's open to other fair offers, so I'll make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, 55/45. Take it or leave it!""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, giving me 55 dollars and Bob 45 dollars."
