"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, aiming for a quick agreement. I'll take $9,000, leaving $1,000 for Bob.  Let's see if he's happy with this."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, given the inflation that has already kicked in. While I will lose 10% of the value of the money I gain, it's still better than accepting a paltry $1,000 while he gets $9,000. I'll reject this offer and make a new one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this round. Since Bob clearly wants a larger share, I'll offer him $2,000, while taking $8,000 for myself. This is still a good deal for me considering the inflation. Let's see if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is even more unfair than the last round! I am losing a significant portion of my gains due to inflation, and Bob is still trying to get the lion's share. I refuse to accept this, and I will make a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

This round, I'm going to increase Bob's share to $3,000, hoping to reach a compromise.  I'm losing value due to inflation with each round, so I need to find a balance between getting a decent amount and avoiding further stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still far from fair. While the inflation is hitting me hard, I'm still determined to get a better deal. I reject his offer and will propose a new one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again, aiming for a more balanced split.  I'll take $6,000, leaving $4,000 for Bob.  This is still a significant amount for me considering the current inflation, and hopefully, it's enough to make Bob consider accepting."
