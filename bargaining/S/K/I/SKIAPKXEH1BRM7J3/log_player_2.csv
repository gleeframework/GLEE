"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, considering the risk of inflation.

# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While an even split sounds fair, I know the value of my share will decrease with each round.  I'm going to try and get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I think it's fair to split the money in a way that reflects the risk of inflation. I'm taking a bigger share this time since I'll be the one proposing. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation risk, I propose we split the money more evenly. This way, both of us benefit equally. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer is better than risking even further losses in the next round."
