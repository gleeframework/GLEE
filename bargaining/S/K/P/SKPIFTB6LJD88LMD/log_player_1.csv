I'm starting with a proposal that favors me a bit, hoping to secure a good deal early on before the inflation takes effect.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm losing 5% of my share due to inflation, Bob's offer is a fair split.  Accepting this offer ensures I get half of the remaining money, which is better than risking further inflation and potentially getting nothing at all."
