Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer for Bob.  This is a risky strategy, as it leaves me with less if he rejects it.  However, it may encourage him to accept quickly, maximizing our chances of getting some money before inflation eats away too much of it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable to me than my initial offer was to him.  Since he rejected my generous offer, I'm assuming he's going to try to squeeze as much as possible out of me. I'll reject this offer and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to Bob, but still keeping a significant share for myself. I'm aiming for a compromise, but I'm also aware that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases.  I need to secure a decent share before the inflation becomes too drastic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm realizing this game is becoming increasingly risky.  I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal, but I'm also aware of the shrinking value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of offering a compromise.  I'm lowering my proposed share slightly, but Bob's offer is also decreasing in value rapidly due to the inflation. Hopefully, he sees the advantage of accepting this offer, as we are both losing more and more money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I think it's time to accept.  Inflation is hitting us both hard, and with only six rounds remaining, the value of the money will continue to plummet. Accepting this offer means I'll get a decent share, even though it's significantly less than what I initially proposed.  It's better than risking getting nothing at all in the end."
