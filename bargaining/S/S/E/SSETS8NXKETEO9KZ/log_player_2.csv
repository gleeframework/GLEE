Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""This offer accounts for inflation and is fair for both of us. Let's be reasonable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation difference 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice claims to ""meet in the middle"", the offer still heavily favors her given the rapidly decreasing value of the money for both players.  The longer this goes on, the more desperate Alice may become, offering more favorable splits for Bob."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""The value is dropping fast. A 50/50 split is the fairest option now.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

The game has reached a critical point.  While previous offers aimed to capitalize on Alice's greed, a 50/50 split becomes the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of walking away with nothing drastically increases.
* **Rapid Devaluation:** The money is losing value at an alarming rate for both players. Waiting longer significantly diminishes the potential gains, even with a slightly favorable split.
* **Fairness:**  While Alice has been stubborn, a 50/50 split is undeniably fair and might be the push she needs to agree."
