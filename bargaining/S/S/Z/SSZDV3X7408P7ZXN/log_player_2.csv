"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more now, since the value decreases for me over time. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the value of the money decreases by 5% for me each round, I have an incentive to finish the game as quickly as possible. However, accepting 45% of the money in the first round might not be the best option, as it gives Alice a significant advantage. Rejecting this offer gives me a chance to propose a more favorable division in the next round, hoping Alice will accept it before the value of the money decreases further for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince I'm playing as Bob and the value of the money decreases by 5% for me each round, my goal is to end the game as soon as possible while getting a fair share. Considering Alice's initial offer was 45% for me and 55% for her, I'll try to find a middle ground that might be acceptable for both of us, but slightly in my favor to compensate for the decreasing value of money over time.
