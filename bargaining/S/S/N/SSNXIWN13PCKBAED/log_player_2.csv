Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is slightly better than her previous one, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show strength and willingness to risk it all to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the only fair deal. Take it or leave it.""} 

**Reasoning:** 

It's time for a power play. By offering a perfectly even split, I'm calling Alice's bluff and highlighting the ridiculousness of her demands in light of the inflation working against me. This sends a strong signal that I'm willing to walk away if she doesn't start negotiating fairly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, Bob. My offer is better than nothing 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

While this offer is far from ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point.  Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much, and the longer this drags on, the more I lose to inflation.  Accepting now secures me something, which is better than nothing if we run out of rounds."
