Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  This offer is a good compromise considering the inflation. We need to reach an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Alice is still offering more than I think I can get, but I'm not desperate yet. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
