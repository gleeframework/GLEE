"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 90/10 split. This ensures we both get a significant share, and I'm happy to negotiate further if you have any concerns. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is likely to reject this offer, as he is getting a much smaller share. He will want to see if he can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I believe a 60/40 split is fair, considering the potential for inflation in the future. It allows both of us to gain a significant amount, and I'm open to discussing other options if you have any.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective on inflation, but I believe a 80/20 split is more equitable. This way, we both get a substantial share, and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation and potential losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Bob likely still sees a potential to get more money than this offer provides. He'll likely hope to negotiate a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but a 70/30 split feels like a fairer balance, given the potential losses from inflation. It still allows for a significant share for you, and I hope we can reach an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: With inflation affecting us both, a 70/30 split still seems reasonable. It ensures a significant gain for each of us, and avoids further rounds of negotiation that could leave us both worse off. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob should accept this offer. While the 70/30 split is not ideal, it's still a significant gain for him, especially considering the effects of inflation. Continuing to negotiate risks both players getting nothing if they run out of rounds.  The potential losses from further inflation outweigh the potential for a slightly better deal."
