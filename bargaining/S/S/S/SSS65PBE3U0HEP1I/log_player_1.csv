"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal that gives me a decent share while still leaving Bob with a substantial amount.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth even less now, so I'd like to accept Bob's offer to at least get something.
