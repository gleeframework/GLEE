"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, let's start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or not."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast! You're getting too greedy.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the previous round, and considering Bob's previous offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You want more, I'll give you less, but still a fair deal!""
}
```"
