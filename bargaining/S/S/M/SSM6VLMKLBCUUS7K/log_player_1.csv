Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take more this time, since the money is losing value for me. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting greedier, and the inflation is working in my favor. I'll hold out for a better offer. Each round that Bob rejects my offers brings his potential gains down significantly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""This is a good deal for both of us, Bob, considering the circumstances. Let's wrap it up.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm slightly increasing my offer to entice Bob while the inflation is still chipping away at his potential gains.  There's a chance he might get desperate and accept a slightly less favorable offer in the next round if he rejects this one."
