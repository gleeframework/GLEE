"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm also confident in my ability to get a better deal if you reject this.  Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as it's highly unequal and Alice is getting a much larger share. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get a better deal.\n\nAlso, since the money is worth 5% less in each subsequent round, I'd like to try to reach a more equitable agreement before the value of the money decreases further.\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly and avoid losing too much to inflation!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than your last offer. Let's split it fairly, and avoid losing more money to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as it's still not entirely fair, and I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Although Alice has compromised, the offer is still slightly in her favor.\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round to try to reach a more equitable agreement.\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it exactly in half to be fair and stop losing money to inflation!""}"
