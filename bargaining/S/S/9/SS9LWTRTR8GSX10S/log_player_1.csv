"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40""}\n\n###\n\nSince I have the upper hand in the first round, I'll offer Bob a slightly lower share. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer before the money loses value due to inflation. If he declines, I'll have to adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds to account for the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split seems a little uneven considering the inflation.  How about we try 45/55? 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth 20% less, I need to adjust my expectations. However, considering Bob's offer is still relatively close to an even split, and taking into account the looming threat of further inflation, I think accepting this offer might be the best course of action. It ensures I get a significant portion of the money before its value decreases further.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
