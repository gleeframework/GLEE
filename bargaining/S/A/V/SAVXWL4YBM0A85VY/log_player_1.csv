"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Since I'm getting $300,000, that's only 30% of the original $1,000,000, which is a relatively small share. I'll reject this offer to try to get a better deal. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is worth 40% of its original value now (80% of 80% of the original value). I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

I'll take $420,000 and leave $580,000 for Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value quickly! In this round, I'll have to be very careful. Since I'm getting $100,000, that's only 10% of the original $1,000,000, which is a very small share. I'll reject this offer to try to get a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth only 51.2% of its original value now (80% of 64% of the original value). I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 240000,
  ""bob_gain"": 760000

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! With the current offer, I'll only get $50,000, which is a very small share. Considering the value of the money is decreasing so quickly, I think it's time to take a smaller share now rather than risking getting nothing in the end. I'll accept this offer.
