"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36
* Bob gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54

I'll accept Bob's offer.
