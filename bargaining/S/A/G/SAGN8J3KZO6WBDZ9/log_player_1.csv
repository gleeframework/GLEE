"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a 9000/1000 split, favoring myself slightly.  This is a strong starting point, and I believe it's fair considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While a 1000/9000 split was reasonable in the first round, inflation has changed the game.  My share is worth significantly less now.  It's time to see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I propose an 8000/2000 split. While I'm willing to give some ground, the inflation has significantly diminished the value of my potential earnings. I'm still aiming for a fair deal, but I'm not willing to accept a lopsided split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Bob seems to be holding strong to his position, but I'm not going to accept a deal where I'm getting significantly less than what I'd earn if we just waited until the end of the game.  The inflation is affecting me, but I'm not desperate yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 7000/3000.  We're approaching the halfway point of the game, and the inflation is starting to bite. While I'm willing to compromise, I need to ensure a reasonable return on my investment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  Bob is playing a dangerous game.  He's increasing his stake each round, but the inflation is hurting him too. If we keep going, we both risk getting nothing. I'm going to try to find a compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I propose a 6000/4000 split. We're getting close to the end, and the inflation is becoming a serious factor. This offer reflects a significant concession on my part, but I believe it's still a fair deal, considering the potential for us to both end up with nothing."
