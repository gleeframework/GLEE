I'm going to start with a very greedy offer.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I want to secure as much of the money as possible in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While I'm losing nothing to inflation, I'm still getting significantly less than the first offer. I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm going to offer a more reasonable split this time.  I'm still aiming for a good deal, but I need to be more realistic given that Bob rejected my first offer.  I think this is a fair compromise that could lead to an agreement."
