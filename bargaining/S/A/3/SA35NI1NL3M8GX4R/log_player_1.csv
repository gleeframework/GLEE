Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the value of the money decreases with each round. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Bob's offer is tempting, but it heavily favors him.  Let's analyze:

* **Current Round:** Round 2 (10% inflation already hit)
* **My Offer (Round 1):** I get $600,000 (worth $540,000 now), Bob gets $400,000.
* **Bob's Offer (Round 2):**  I get $400,000, Bob gets $600,000 

If I reject, I'm banking on getting a better offer in the next rounds when I propose. However, the value of the money will decrease further. 

Let's be a bit risky and try to negotiate a better deal.
