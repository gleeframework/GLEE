"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal this time, but don't expect it to last! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move from Bob!

I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, this offer seems more favorable to me. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
