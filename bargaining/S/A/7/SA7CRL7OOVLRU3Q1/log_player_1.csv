I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it right away. It's important to establish some trust and show good faith in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is extremely unfair. I'm not going to let him take almost everything, especially with the inflation penalty I'm facing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's fair, and considering the inflation, it's the best I can do while still securing a significant share of the money."
