"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a slightly larger share. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

I'll reject this offer. Bob's offer is not generous enough for me.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was not generous enough, I'll make a new offer that's slightly more favorable to myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
