"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I get a bit more""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and I'll take $6000, which seems like a reasonable starting point, considering we both want a significant share. I've also included a message to Bob, suggesting this is a fair split, with me getting a bit more. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn! How about a slightly better deal for me this time? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less now due to inflation, I think I can still get a better deal than $4500. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a good deal for both""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4200 and I'll take $5800. Since the money is worth less with each round, I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and considering the decreasing value. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking! This is a pretty good deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer again. Although the money is worth significantly less now, I think I can still negotiate a bit better. Since the gap between our proposed shares is getting smaller, I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. Let's move on to the next round!"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Middle ground, considering the inflation, let's settle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4400 and I'll take $5600. At this point, the money is worth almost half as much as it was initially for me, and about a quarter less for Bob. I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both accept, considering the decreasing value. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and we can settle on this split."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait, 50/50? That actually sounds pretty good at this point! Considering how much value the money has lost, getting half of the original amount is a decent deal. And Bob is right, it's a quick way to end this game before the money becomes almost worthless.
