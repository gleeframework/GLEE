"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, keeping 90% for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to keep more, the inflation is a serious factor. Accepting this offer guarantees me at least half the money, even with the reduced value. It's a safer bet than risking a further reduction in my share."
