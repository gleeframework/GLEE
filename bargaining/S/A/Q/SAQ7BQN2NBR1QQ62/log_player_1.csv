Although he's trying to appeal to my sense of fairness with a 50/50 split, I know that his share is actually worth 40.95% less than in the first round due to inflation. This means that, in real terms, I'd be getting significantly more value out of the deal than Bob. However, considering the decreasing value of Bob's share, I'm holding out for an even better offer or trying to make a counteroffer that further takes advantage of the inflation.
