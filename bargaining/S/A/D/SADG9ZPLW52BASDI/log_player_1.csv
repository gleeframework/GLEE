"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Let's split close to even, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first offer.  This ensures we both benefit from acting quickly.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but I'm confident we can reach a more equitable outcome. Let's swap positions and see if this feels fairer. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer prevents further losses due to inflation."
