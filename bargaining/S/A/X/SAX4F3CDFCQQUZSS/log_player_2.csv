Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money in this game.  I'm willing to compromise slightly from my initial offer, but we need to settle this now before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4700,
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the time pressure here, but I'm also trying to be reasonable. This offer is a fair compromise, especially with the inflation working against you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or I will be forced to be even less generous in the next round. The clock is ticking! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the inflation is significantly impacting Alice's potential gains. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 44/56 split ensures I at least get something reasonable before the value diminishes further for Alice, potentially making her even less willing to negotiate fairly.
