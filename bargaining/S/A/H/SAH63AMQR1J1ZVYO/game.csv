4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, that initial split was far too generous towards you. Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor to account for the inflation factor. This offer is time-sensitive, as its value decreases with each round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to budge a bit, but this is a fair split considering the inflation affecting your share.",Alice,3,

3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is slipping away with each passing round.  I'm sticking to a split that heavily favors me due to the inflation, but I'm increasing my offer slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate. This is a fair deal considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,

5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be reasonable and split it evenly.  The inflation is hitting both of us, and this is the fairest way to divide the remaining value.",Alice,5,
