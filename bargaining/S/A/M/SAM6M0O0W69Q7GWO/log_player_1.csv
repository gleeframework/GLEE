"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You get a smaller share, but I'll make it worth it!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fair.  It's still a good deal for both of us, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 45% share, I'd like to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. 55-45 was too low for me, but 55.56-44.44 is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55.56-44.44 split, trying to meet Bob in the middle."
