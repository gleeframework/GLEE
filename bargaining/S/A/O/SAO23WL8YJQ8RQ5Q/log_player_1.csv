"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, with me taking 900,000 and Bob taking 100,000. This seems like a fair starting point considering the inflation that will impact both of us differently in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer is the most strategic move. My gains are significantly lower than in the first round, but Bob's offer still provides a decent amount of money.  If I reject, the money will be worth even less in the next round, and there's no guarantee that Bob will offer me anything at all.  It's better to take what I can get now."
