I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob. I figure if I give him a small amount now, he might be more likely to accept a better deal for me later on. Plus, with inflation, the value of my offer will decrease with each round, so I want to secure as much as possible early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, it's a much better deal than I would have gotten in the next round due to inflation. It's better to take what I can get now, and hopefully Bob is more generous in the future."
