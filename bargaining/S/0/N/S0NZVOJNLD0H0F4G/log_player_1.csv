Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I believe it's a fair compromise given the circumstances. We're both losing value with each passing round, and I'm not willing to accept a split that leaves me with significantly less than half.  Let's end this game on a mutually beneficial note.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming too significant to ignore. Accepting Bob's offer still yields a better result than continuing to negotiate and risking a no-deal outcome. 

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of getting nothing is very high if we don't reach an agreement soon.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Each round that passes makes the potential gains significantly smaller for me due to inflation.
* **Bob's Stance:** His message implies he's unlikely to budge further. Accepting now secures a reasonable amount, even if it's less than initially desired."
