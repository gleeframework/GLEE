"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can finish the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight discount, but I still want a majority 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good deal for me. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 5% less, I think I should aim for a higher share. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
