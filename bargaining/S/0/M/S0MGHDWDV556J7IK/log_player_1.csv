"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money. Don't bother making a proposal.""
}
```

This is a pretty aggressive opening offer, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate and we can get to a more reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 99 and you get 1.  This way we both get something, and there's plenty of time left in the game to make better deals. 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about getting only $1, but I don't want to give up the opportunity to negotiate further. I'll accept this offer for now and see if I can do better in future rounds.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
