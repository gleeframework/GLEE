"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to be fair and split the money 50/50, but considering the inflation, this is actually a good deal for me. I'll accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
