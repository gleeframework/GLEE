"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
This is a fairly generous offer, considering I'm getting the larger share, but it's still a reasonable split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for Bob, this offer is actually quite reasonable. I'll accept it.
