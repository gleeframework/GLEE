Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving towards a more even split, it's still heavily in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more we both lose. I'm hoping by continuing to reject these offers, she'll get more desperate and offer a fairer split."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 540000, ""alice_gain"": 460000, ""message"": ""This is a generous offer considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's be realistic and end this.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point. The longer this goes on, the more desperate both sides might become, potentially leading to less rational decisions. 
* **Shifting the Balance:** I'm offering a bit more than her last offer, but still keeping a slight advantage for myself. This shows willingness to compromise but also maintains a firm stance.
* **Direct Language:** The message is designed to be assertive and encourage Alice to make a rational decision, considering the ticking clock and shrinking pot."
