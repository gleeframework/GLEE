"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split is fair and will save us from the effects of inflation later on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to remember that the money is worth less each round.  I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. This split is fair, given the inflation we're facing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need to be mindful of the inflation. This offer is a compromise, slightly better for you than your last. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would still like a larger share, the inflation is becoming a real concern. This offer is a good compromise, especially given the potential for even more losses in the next round."
