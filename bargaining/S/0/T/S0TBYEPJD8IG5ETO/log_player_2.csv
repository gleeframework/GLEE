Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""That's not a great start, Alice! How about we go 60/40? It's a much fairer split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your proposal, Bob.  However, I think we can do better. I'm willing to go 60/40, but I'll need to keep the larger share. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against her.  While 40/60 isn't terrible, I think I can get her closer to 50/50 in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be real.  I'm offering a 55/45 split.  It's getting close to the point where the inflation will make this not worthwhile for me, so take the deal while you can still get a good chunk!""}"
