"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the majority, but you still get something. We can work something out in the following rounds. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to take the $10 now, it's better to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further. I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer. We both get a decent amount, and it's a good starting point for future negotiations.""}
