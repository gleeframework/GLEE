"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further if needed""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. This way, I'll get $80, which is a decent starting point for the game. The message is a friendly opening offer, inviting Bob to consider it and potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even. I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than the initial $80, which is $64.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is decreasing in value with each round, I'd rather accept a smaller share now and move on to the next round, where I can potentially make a better offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
