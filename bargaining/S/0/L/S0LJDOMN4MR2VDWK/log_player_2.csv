Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll play your game. But I'm not giving up more than 50% of the pot. You get 4500, I'll take 5500. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is slightly better than her last one, time is working against me more than Alice.  I need to push for a better share soon, or risk getting even less as the rounds progress."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time! This offer is more than fair. Take it and we both win.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing my luck a bit here, but I need to stand firm on getting a larger share. The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me.  By round 4, the inflation is cutting into the overall value significantly, so a sense of urgency needs to be emphasized."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. You get 4800, I take 5200. Let's not let this go any further. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough decision, but the clock is ticking loudly. While I'm not thrilled with getting less than Alice, waiting any longer will only hurt me more due to the faster inflation rate I face. Accepting now at least guarantees me something, whereas pushing further could lead to us both walking away with nothing."
