Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm the one making the first proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer. While I understand the effects of inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal than a 30/70 split. I'll try to negotiate a more favorable outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm offering a 45/55 split in my favor. This takes into account the inflation and Bob's previous offer, but still gives me a larger share. I believe this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money, I'm accepting this offer. Bob's offer is slightly better than my previous offer and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round."
