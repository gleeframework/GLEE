"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting the offer. Considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'd better get a larger share now.

I accept the offer.
