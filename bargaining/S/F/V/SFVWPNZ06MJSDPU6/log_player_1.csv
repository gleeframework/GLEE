"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer because, due to inflation, the actual value of the money I'd get is less than what I initially wanted. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the current value of the money, which is equivalent to 48% of the original $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate accelerating, I need to adjust my expectations even further.

Let me calculate the actual value of the money I'd get from Bob's offer:

Original $10,000 * (1 - 0.488) = $5,200 (current value of the money)
Bob's offer: $5,500, which is equivalent to 105.77% of the current value of the money

Considering this, I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation rate still increasing, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll aim for an even higher percentage to account for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This way, I'll get 50% of the current value of the money, which is equivalent to 25% of the original $10,000."
