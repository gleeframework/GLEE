"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 80-20 sounds reasonable to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a pretty lopsided deal, Bob. I'm not willing to give up 70% of the money, even if it's slightly more than my initial offer.""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, my offer will also be worth less. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. 60-40 seems like a more reasonable split, considering the risks and rewards.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a more balanced deal than Bob's previous offer."

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 14.26% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll reassess the offer.

```

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. 55-45 seems like a fairer split, considering the decreasing value of the money.""
