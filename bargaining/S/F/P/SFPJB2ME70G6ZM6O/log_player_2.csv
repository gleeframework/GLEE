"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm sure you understand the value of a quick deal. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer seems generous at first, it's important to consider the potential for a better deal later.  Rejecting this offer allows me to make a proposal in the next round and potentially get a larger share. The risk of inflation is present, but I can try to compensate for it by proposing a deal that favors me more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair. I'm willing to split the money more evenly. This way, we both get a decent share without waiting for the inflation to kick in.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I'm still hoping for a fair share. Let's not let inflation ruin this for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. 

* **Inflation:**  My gains are worth significantly less due to inflation. 
* **Alice's Stance:** She's clearly not willing to give up a lot, and her offer is a significant improvement from the first round.
* **Risk:**  There's a strong possibility of getting nothing if I continue to reject offers, especially with the increasing impact of inflation.

This offer guarantees me a reasonable share of the money while mitigating the risks of further negotiation."
