"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good start.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, which I think is a fair starting point. I'm open to negotiations, but I want to make sure I get a significant share. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept, while also leaving room for further discussion. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I'm feeling more generous now. Let's make a deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Come on, Bob. Meet me in the middle.""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer slightly, giving Bob a bit more than before, but still keeping the majority for myself. I'm trying to convey that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much. The message is a friendly nudge to encourage Bob to accept this offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time, Alice. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000
