"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000. This is a generous offer considering Bob's money will be worth less in the next round.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although Bob is getting a larger share, I'll accept the offer.  In the next round, Bob's share will decrease again, and my share will stay the same. It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing at all."
