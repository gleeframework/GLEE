"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share, and I get a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still a fair split. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth less due to inflation, I need to be more cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this is a fair split, especially considering the money is worth less now. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still not giving up too much. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

This way, I'm offering a slightly better deal for Bob, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth even less due to inflation, I need to be even more careful.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced this is a good deal, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. Your turn to decide!""

```

Round 6

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I'm getting close to what I want. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 2800 
# Bob gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth significantly less due to inflation, I'm getting desperate to get a good deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've been holding out for too long, and this offer is getting closer to what I can expect in the next round. I'll accept this deal and hope it's the best I can get."
