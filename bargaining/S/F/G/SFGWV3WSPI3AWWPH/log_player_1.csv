"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent amount, but I'm looking for a better split. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000$ is now worth 3600$ (since it's 10% less than 4000$).

I'm not too thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'll consider it. I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is taking a toll!

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of 4500$ is now worth 3277.50$ (since it's 27.1% less than 4500$).
Bob's gain of 5500$ is now worth 4714.86$ (since it's 14.26% less than 5500$).

Hmm, I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation. I think I can do better...
