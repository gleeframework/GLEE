"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90% for me and 10% for you, a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, a fair and equal split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 5% less for me, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Meeting in the middle sounds like a fair proposal, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up half of the remaining money.

I'll reject this offer for now and wait for the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less than in the second round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself to make this worthwhile.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share than before, but I'm still willing to give him a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is as low as I can go 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite! The money is worth significantly less now, and I need to adjust my strategy accordingly.

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer is actually a decent one. I'm not thrilled about giving up 60% of the remaining money, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.

I'll accept this offer.
