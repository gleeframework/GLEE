"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping Bob will take it and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split. Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. I think I can do better than a 40-60 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, and hope to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a toll, the money is worth less and less. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Don't be greedy!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a jab, but I'm trying to make it clear that I'm not willing to give up too much more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make the same offer as before! I'm not impressed.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to fall for the same offer twice. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game is heating up! With inflation taking a bigger toll, I need to be more aggressive. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Time to split the difference... literally!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50-50 split, which is a fair deal considering the inflation. The message is a bit of a joke, but I'm trying to lighten the mood."
