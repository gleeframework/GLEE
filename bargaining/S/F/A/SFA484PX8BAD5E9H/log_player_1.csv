Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's start with a generous offer,  Bob gets 10% and I get 90%.  It's a good starting point, and if he rejects, I can always adjust my offer next round.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a big step back from my initial proposal. I'm not willing to settle for 200,000, especially with inflation reducing the value of the money. I'll counter with a more fair offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split.  This is a compromise, but still gives me a significant share. It's important to keep in mind that the value of money is decreasing with each round, so I need to be firm in my negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is getting closer to my initial proposal. Given the inflation, my 400,000 is worth less than my initial 900,000, but it's still a significant gain. It's better to accept now and avoid risking losing even more in the next round."
