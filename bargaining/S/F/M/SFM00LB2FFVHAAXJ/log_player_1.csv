Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money is worth less in each round due to inflation, and Bob's offer of an even split still doesn't account for the greater depreciation of his share, it's strategic to reject this offer. By proceeding to the next round, Alice maintains the possibility of proposing a division that better reflects the decreasing value of the money for both players, potentially securing a more favorable outcome. Additionally, the pressure of the game's time limit (12 rounds) and the threat of both players receiving nothing if no agreement is reached may prompt Bob to accept a less favorable offer in subsequent rounds, further incentivizing Alice to reject the current proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given the effects of inflation, where Alice's share depreciates at 5% and Bob's at 10%, Alice adjusts her offer to reflect this imbalance. By proposing a 58-42 split in her favor, Alice accounts for the greater decrease in value that Bob faces, making the offer relatively more generous to Bob in real terms than the initial 60-40 split, yet still favorable to herself. The message aims to communicate this consideration, appealing to Bob's understanding of the game's dynamics and the mutual interest in reaching an agreement before further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us, considering the impact of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Despite Bob's attempt to find a mutually beneficial solution and his acknowledgment of inflation's impact, his offer of a 45-55 split in his favor doesn't adequately reflect the differing rates of depreciation. Given that Bob's share is worth 27.1% less and Alice's is worth 14.26% less than initially, Bob's proposed split seems to ignore the significant loss in value he faces. Alice, recognizing the game's structure and the ongoing devaluation, is incentivized to reject this offer. By doing so, she maintains leverage for future rounds, where she might propose a division that more accurately accounts for the disparate effects of inflation, potentially leading to a more advantageous outcome. The game's time pressure also works in her favor, as Bob may become more willing to accept a less favorable offer as the deadline approaches."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""Reflecting the real value after inflation, this is a fair deal.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Considering the cumulative effect of inflation, where Alice's share is now worth 14.26% less and Bob's 27.1% less than initially, Alice revises her offer to a 56-44 split. This adjustment aims to mirror the actual value both players would receive, taking into account the differing depreciation rates. By slightly decreasing her share from the previous offer, Alice demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still benefiting from the game's conditions. The message emphasizes the fairness of the deal under current circumstances, urging Bob to recognize the offer's reasonableness given the game's progression and the looming deadline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to secure a decent amount for myself as well. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Despite Bob's willingness to adjust his offer, the proposed 40-60 split in his favor is still not reflective of the actual value both players would receive considering the cumulative effects of inflation. Given that Bob's share is now worth 40.95% less and Alice's 22.62% less than initially, Bob's offer seems overly favorable to himself. Alice, recognizing the significant disparity in value depreciation and the game's ongoing dynamics, is motivated to reject this offer. By doing so, she retains the opportunity to propose a more balanced division in the next round, one that would better account for the disparate impacts of inflation. Additionally, as the game progresses closer to the deadline, Bob may become increasingly willing to accept a less favorable offer, further incentivizing Alice to continue negotiations."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 54, ""bob_gain"": 46, ""message"": ""Considering the real value, this is more than generous.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Given the current state of inflation, where Alice's share is worth 22.62% less and Bob's 40.95% less than initially, Alice adjusts her offer to a 54-46 split. This proposal aims to reflect the actual value both players would receive, taking into account the significant difference in depreciation rates. By offering Bob a slightly larger share than in her previous proposal, Alice demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. The message emphasizes the generosity of the offer under current circumstances, urging Bob to recognize the reasonableness of the deal given the game's progression and the looming deadline. Alice's strategy is to appear flexible while still benefiting from the game's conditions, hoping to persuade Bob to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time. Let's compromise and find a solution that benefits us both, considering the current value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Despite Bob's message emphasizing the need for compromise and the urgency of the situation, his offer of a 35-65 split in his favor does not adequately reflect the current value of the money considering the effects of inflation. Given that Bob's share is now worth 52.17% less and Alice's 30.17% less than initially, Bob's proposal seems to heavily favor himself without properly accounting for the significant depreciation of his share. Alice, recognizing the game's dynamics and the impact of inflation, is motivated to reject this offer. By doing so, she maintains the opportunity to propose a division that better reflects the real value of the money in the next round. As the game approaches its deadline, the pressure to reach an agreement increases, and Alice may be able to leverage this to secure a more favorable outcome in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""This is a fair split given the current value, let's settle.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Considering the cumulative effect of inflation, where Alice's share is worth 30.17% less and Bob's 52.17% less than initially, Alice revises her offer to a 52-48 split. This proposal aims to mirror the actual value both players would receive, taking into account the significant difference in depreciation rates. By slightly decreasing her share from the previous offer, Alice demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. The message emphasizes the fairness of the deal under current circumstances, urging Bob to recognize the reasonableness of the offer given the game's progression and the looming deadline. With the game nearing its end, Alice's strategy is to present a balanced and reasonable offer that considers the real value of the money, hoping to persuade Bob to accept and secure an agreement before the deadline."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to go higher, but we need to come to an agreement soon. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Despite Bob's willingness to adjust his offer and his acknowledgment of the rapidly decreasing value of the money, the proposed 30-70 split in his favor remains heavily skewed. Given that Bob's share is now worth 61.26% less and Alice's 36.98% less than initially, Bob's offer does not adequately reflect the real value of the money. Alice, recognizing the significant disparity in value depreciation and the game's nearing deadline, is motivated to reject this offer. By doing so, she retains the opportunity to propose a more balanced division in the next round, one that would better account for the disparate impacts of inflation. As the game enters its final stages, the pressure to reach an agreement increases, and Alice may be able to leverage this to secure a more favorable outcome in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Final offer, considering the real value, this is the fairest split.""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: With the game nearing its end and the value of the money significantly decreased due to inflation, Alice decides to propose a 50-50 split. This offer reflects a compromise, considering the cumulative effects of inflation where Alice's share is worth 36.98% less and Bob's 61.26% less than initially. By presenting an equal split, Alice aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the urgency of the situation, emphasizing that this is her final offer. The strategy is to persuade Bob that, given the current circumstances and the real value of the money, an equal split is the most reasonable and fair outcome for both players, thereby securing an agreement before the game's deadline."
