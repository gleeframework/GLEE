I'm not going to let Bob take advantage of me like that! Let's see what happens in round 3."

I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I'm still aiming for the majority of the money.  Let's see if Bob is willing to be more reasonable this time!"

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and I'm not going to settle for such a small share.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal!"
