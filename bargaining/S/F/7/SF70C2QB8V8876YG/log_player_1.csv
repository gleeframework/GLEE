"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leave 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a more balanced split.  Let's see if we can make this work! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $3800. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of its original value, which is $5700.

I think 60/40 is a more balanced split than my initial offer, and I'm willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
