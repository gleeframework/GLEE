Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a tough start, Alice. I understand you want a good deal, but so do I.  How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It's still a significant gain for you, and accounts for the time pressure.

Round 4

# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time and the money is literally shrinking.  50/50 sounds fair on the surface, but inflation hits me harder.  I'm proposing 52/48 - it's a small edge for me, but keeps us both ahead of the curve.
