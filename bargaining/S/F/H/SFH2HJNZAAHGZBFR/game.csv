45.0,55.0,"That's a tough start, Alice. I understand you want a good deal, but so do I.  How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It's still a significant gain for you, and accounts for the time pressure.",Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Let's try to be reasonable here, Bob.  Inflation is hurting us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the remaining money, and it gives us both something to work with.  What do you say?",Alice,3,
