"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take less to begin with.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, you can't resist my generosity! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my gain of $200,000 is worth only $190,000 (95% of $200,000) in the current round, while Bob's gain of $800,000 is worth $720,000 (90% of $800,000).

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher gain to account for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too generous, let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the inflation and gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I'm still the one making the offer 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is worth only $344,000 (86.2% of $400,000), while Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth $438,000 (73% of $600,000).

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the increasing inflation. I'll aim for a slightly higher gain to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more.""
}
```

This offer reflects the decreasing value of the money due to inflation and gives me a slightly higher share, but still leaves room for negotiation."
