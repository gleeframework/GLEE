"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
I propose to take 900,000 and give Bob 100,000.  This is a fair starting point, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach a deal quickly before inflation eats away at the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is far less favorable than my initial proposal, and it appears he's attempting to exploit the inflation to his advantage. I'll reject this offer and see if we can come to a more equitable agreement in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I still believe a more balanced distribution is fair. I'm offering 600,000 for myself and 400,000 for Bob. This takes into account the inflation and should be a more attractive deal than his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer continues to be unfair. While the inflation does impact the overall value, his proposal still heavily favors him, and I won't accept such a lopsided distribution.  I will continue to advocate for a fairer split in the subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

Given Bob's continued insistence on an imbalanced split, I propose we go for a 50/50 division. This is the fairest option considering the rapidly increasing inflation and ensures we both get a significant portion before the money becomes worthless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly in his favor. While the inflation has eroded the value of the money, a 50/50 split is the most fair and equitable solution at this point. I will continue to advocate for a more balanced division in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

We are quickly approaching the end of the game, and inflation is eating away at the potential gains. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway, offering him 450,000 while keeping 550,000 for myself. This is a compromise that acknowledges the inflation while still allowing for a decent outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is simply unacceptable.  Despite the significant inflation, a 350,000/650,000 split is still heavily skewed in his favor.  I refuse to accept such an unfair deal, even with the shrinking value of the money.  We need to reach a more equitable agreement in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

With only a few rounds left, we need to find a compromise. I'm willing to lower my previous offer, offering Bob 550,000 and taking 450,000 for myself. This is a significant concession, and I hope it will finally encourage Bob to accept a deal before the money loses all its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unreasonable. It is clear he is trying to take advantage of the inflation and is not interested in a fair agreement.  Even with the declining value, I refuse to accept such a lopsided deal. We need to come to a compromise in the remaining rounds, or we will both lose everything."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

This is my final offer.  The inflation has drastically reduced the value of the money, and we are nearing the end of the game. While I prefer a 50/50 split, I am willing to compromise further and offer Bob 600,000.  It's time to reach a deal, or we risk losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I cannot accept Bob's offer. Despite the significant inflation, a 100,000/900,000 split is completely unreasonable.  It's clear Bob is trying to exploit the situation, and I refuse to be taken advantage of.  While we both lose everything in this scenario, I won't compromise my principles for such an unfair deal."
