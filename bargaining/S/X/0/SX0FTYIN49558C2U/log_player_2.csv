Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 625000

**Reasoning:**

While this offer isn't ideal, it's time to be pragmatic. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (Bob). Every round that passes eats significantly into my potential gains.
* **Alice's Stance:**  She has labeled this her ""final offer,"" implying she's unlikely to budge much. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in the later rounds carries a significant risk of getting nothing at all if we fail to agree.

Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable, albeit not perfect, payout."
