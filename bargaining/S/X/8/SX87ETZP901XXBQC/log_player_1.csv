"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $4000, and I'll take $6000. It's a 60-40 split, which is a good starting point. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you're lowballing me. I'll take $7,000 and you can have the rest. It's a 70-30 split. Consider it a generous offer. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's still a decent amount.

However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure I'm willing to accept a 70-30 split. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a steep split. I'm not sure I'm comfortable with 70-30. I'll make a counteroffer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 81% of what it was in the first round, so I'll make a new offer that takes that into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll take $4,500 and you can have $5,500. It's a 45-55 split. Let's see if we can find common ground.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more. I'll take $6,000 and you can have $4,000. It's a 60-40 split. Let's not waste any more time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $4000 is worth 40.9% of what it was in the first round, so it's a relatively small amount compared to what it used to be.

However, Bob's offer is still a 60-40 split, which is not much different from my original offer. I'm not sure I want to give him the upper hand again.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 60-40 split again. I'll try to do better.""
}

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 27.1% of what it was in the first round, so I'll make a new offer that takes that into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. I'll take $3,200 and you can have $6,800. It's a 32-68 split. Let's see if we can find a deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to get taken advantage of. I'll take $8,000 and you can have $2,000. It's a 80-20 split. I'm not budging. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $2000 is worth 20% of what it was in the first round, so it's a very small amount compared to what it used to be.

However, Bob's offer is an 80-20 split, which is extremely one-sided. I'm not sure I want to accept such a lopsided deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with an 80-20 split. I think I can do better than that.""
}
