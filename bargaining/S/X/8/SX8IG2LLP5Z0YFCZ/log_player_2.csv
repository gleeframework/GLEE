"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money if we wait too long. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value due to inflation in hopes of getting a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rate, I believe this offer is more reasonable. If we keep waiting, we'll both lose more value, but I'm willing to take a bit more risk to get a fairer share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This offer is the most advantageous for both of us considering the increasing inflation. We're losing more value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems slightly better than the initial one, considering the inflation and the fact that Alice loses more value than I do with each passing round, I believe I can push for a bit more in the next round. The difference in inflation impact between us gives me some leverage to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Given the difference in how inflation affects us, I'm willing to take another round to try and get a better deal. This offer reflects the increasing urgency due to value loss over time. It's getting more costly for both of us to wait, but more so for you.""}"
