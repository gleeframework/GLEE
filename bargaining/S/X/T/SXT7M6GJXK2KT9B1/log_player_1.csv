Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the one making the proposal.  This seems like a fair starting point given the inflation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject the offer.  While it would have been a decent offer in the first round, the inflation has significantly eroded my gains. I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}
```

I am proposing a 54/46 split in my favor.  While my potential earnings have shrunk due to inflation, I believe this offer is still reasonable given Bob's desire to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not happy with the deal, the inflation has significantly eroded my potential gains. I'm worried that if I reject this offer, I might end up with nothing in the next round."
