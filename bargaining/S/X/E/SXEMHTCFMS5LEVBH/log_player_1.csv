I'm proposing a 90/10 split, favoring myself as the first mover.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a better deal for myself,  a 50/50 split is still good considering the inflation. It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
