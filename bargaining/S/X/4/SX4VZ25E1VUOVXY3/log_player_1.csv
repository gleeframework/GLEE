"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm offering Bob $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation. In this round, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to adjust my calculation.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 80% of $500,000 (the amount I would have gotten in the first round). That's a good deal for me.

I accept Bob's offer.
