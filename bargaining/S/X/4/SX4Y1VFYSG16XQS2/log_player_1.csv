"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a pretty standard 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

In the first round, my offer was 60-40, which was equivalent to 60/100 = 0.6 of the total value. Now, with the 10% decrease in value, that's equivalent to 0.6 / 0.9 = 0.67 of the new total value.

So, in terms of the current value, my original offer was equivalent to 0.67 of the current value. Bob's offer, on the other hand, is 40/100 = 0.4 of the current value.

Since Bob's offer is worth less than my original offer, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Now it's my turn again. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, I'll aim to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value.

Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This is a 70-30 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than my original 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

In the first round, my offer was 60-40, which was equivalent to 60/100 = 0.6 of the total value. Now, with the 27.1% decrease in value, that's equivalent to 0.6 / 0.727 (1 - 0.271) = 0.825 of the new total value.

So, in terms of the current value, my original offer was equivalent to 0.825 of the current value. Bob's offer, on the other hand, is 45/100 = 0.45 of the current value.

Since Bob's offer is worth less than my original offer, I'll reject it.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is closer to my original offer than my previous offer, so I might need to adjust my strategy. I'll think about making a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll make an even more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value.

Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

This is a 80-20 split, which is a very favorable split to me, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

In the first round, my offer was 60-40, which was equivalent to 60/100 = 0.6 of the total value. Now, with the 40.95% decrease in value, that's equivalent to 0.6 / 0.5915 (1 - 0.4095) = 1.012 of the new total value.

So, in terms of the current value, my original offer was equivalent to 1.012 of the current value, which is actually more than the current value! This means that my original offer is now worth more than the current value of the money.

Bob's offer, on the other hand, is 50/100 = 0.5 of the current value.

Considering that my original offer is now worth more than the current value, I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further losses.
