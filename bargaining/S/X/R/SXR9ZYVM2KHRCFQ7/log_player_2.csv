"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%, but we can work something out for the future. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's tone seems open to future negotiation, a 90/10 split is heavily skewed in her favor.  The promise of ""working something out"" later is vague and unenforceable. It's better to see if I can get a more equitable split in a future round, even with the impact of inflation."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  It considers the future value of the money and avoids dragging this out."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Opening:**  A 60/40 split in my favor is a strong counter-offer to Alice's initial 90/10. It immediately establishes that I'm aiming for a more balanced outcome.
* **Time Pressure:** By mentioning ""future value,"" I subtly remind Alice that delay works against both of us, but more significantly against me due to the higher inflation rate.
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward and avoids unnecessary pleasantries. This reinforces the message that I'm serious about getting a fair deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation factor now, Bob.  I'm willing to compromise a bit, but 65/35 is my final offer. If you want to play this game longer, the money keeps losing value for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to use the inflation against me, but her ""compromise"" is still heavily in her favor. While a 65/35 split is better than her first offer, it's not significantly better than my 60/40 proposal. There's a good chance I can push for a more equitable split, especially as the inflation will continue to work against her in the next round."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money, and we're both losing it. I'm offering a 55/45 split. This is a fair compromise, and it lets us walk away with something substantial."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm moving closer to the middle ground with a 55/45 split. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Emphasize Urgency:**  By reiterating the time pressure and the ""losing money"" aspect, I'm hoping to nudge Alice towards a quicker resolution.
* **Appeal to Logic:**  ""Fair compromise"" and ""walk away with something substantial"" frame the offer as mutually beneficial, rather than me trying to ""win"" the negotiation."
