"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and take $600,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable offer and accept it. The message ""Let's be fair"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's not waste any more time with inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems generous, I believe I can get a better deal, especially considering the significant amount of money at stake. With 10 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a more favorable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 570000, ""bob_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $430,000 and take $570,000 for myself. This offer is closer to the middle ground, considering Bob's previous offer. The message ""Let's meet in the middle"" is an attempt to convey a sense of compromise and encourage Bob to accept the offer, especially since we're both losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair offer considering the time pressure.  Let's settle this. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems reasonable, I'm still not convinced that it's the best deal I can get. With 8 rounds left, I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a more favorable offer. Additionally, Bob's message implies that he's feeling the pressure of time, which might give me an advantage in future negotiations.\n### {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Getting closer, let's end this""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $450,000 and take $550,000 for myself. This offer is a slight concession from my previous one, considering the increasing pressure of inflation. The message ""Getting closer, let's end this"" aims to convey a sense of urgency and willingness to compromise, encouraging Bob to accept the offer and avoid further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out Alice. This is as close to even as it's going to get. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant loss of value due to inflation (67.23% less than the initial amount), I think Bob's offer is reasonable. The difference between our gains is relatively small, and further negotiations may not yield a significantly better outcome. The message ""Time is running out Alice. This is as close to even as it's going to get. Take it or leave it"" suggests that Bob is unwilling to make further concessions, so I'll accept the offer to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
