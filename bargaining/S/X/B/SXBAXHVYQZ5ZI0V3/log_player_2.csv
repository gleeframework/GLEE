**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing. It's time to show her I'm serious about getting a fairer share. By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling I'm willing to risk it for a better deal, even with the inflation penalty."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The clock is ticking, and we're both losing money. I propose an even split to end this now. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. Alice needs to understand the urgency of the situation. A 50/50 split is fair, and by framing it as a ""take it or leave it"" ultimatum, I'm increasing the pressure on her to accept before inflation eats away at the value even further."
