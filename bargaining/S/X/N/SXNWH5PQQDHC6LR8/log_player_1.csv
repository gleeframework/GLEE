"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal!""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a fair division. Let's see if Bob accepts or not!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn Alice. I'm aiming for a more equitable split this time.  Remember, the value decreases each round. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal, even considering the decrease in value due to inflation. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle from the last round. This is a reasonable compromise.""}\n\n###\nI'm offering Bob $4,200 and keeping $5,800 for myself, taking into account the decrease in value due to inflation. My message to Bob emphasizes that this is a compromise, considering the previous offers. Let's see if Bob accepts this proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's end this.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option, and we're losing money with each passing round! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation (48.8% less than the first round), a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable option at this point. Continuing the game would likely result in further losses for both of us, so it's best to end it here with a fair split."
