# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think we can find a split more in line with how much value I bring to the table. Let's flip the script and go with a 60-40 split in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'm willing to give up more than I did in the first round. Here's my response:
