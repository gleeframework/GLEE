Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing me! Need a better split to make up for it. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting down to the wire. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 guarantees me $3,000. If I reject and go to Round 6, there's a high chance Alice will offer an even smaller amount, given the increasing impact of inflation on her perceived gains. It's better to secure something now than risk getting even less or nothing."
