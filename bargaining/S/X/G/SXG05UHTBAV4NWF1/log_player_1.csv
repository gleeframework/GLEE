"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair and simple, let's start with a good compromise""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will find it acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't think splitting the money evenly is a good idea, especially since I'm the one making the next offer. I'd like to propose something that takes into account the value of the money decreasing over time."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share considering the value of the money is decreasing""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob gets 45%. I'm trying to find a balance between fairness and my own interests."
