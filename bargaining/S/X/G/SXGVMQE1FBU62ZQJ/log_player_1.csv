"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, which is a decent starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split the money more evenly. I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. This ensures we both get a good share, and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'm not as eager to accept a smaller share. I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 55-45 split. I'll propose a 52-48 split in my favor. Let's see if you'll accept.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious and aim for a higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise on a 52-48 split. I think this is a fairer share considering the inflation.""
}
```"
