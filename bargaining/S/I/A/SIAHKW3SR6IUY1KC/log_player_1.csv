"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to receive $600,000, while Bob receives $400,000. The message ""Let's split fairly"" is intended to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit, encouraging Bob to accept the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI, Alice, reject Bob's offer to split the money evenly. Although the offer may seem fair at first glance, considering the inflation, my share of $500,000 is now worth 10% less than in the first round, while Bob's share is worth 20% less. This means the actual value I would receive is $450,000, and Bob would get $400,000. Given this, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to receive $550,000, while Bob receives $450,000. The message ""Considering inflation, let's adjust"" aims to acknowledge the impact of inflation on our gains and suggests a slightly uneven split to compensate for the difference in how inflation affects us. This offer takes into account the decreased value of money for both of us but still presents a compromise."
