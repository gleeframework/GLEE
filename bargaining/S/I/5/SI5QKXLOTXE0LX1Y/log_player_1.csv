"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm aiming for a large share in the first round to maximize my potential gains, as inflation will affect the value of the money in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While my share is significantly lower than my initial proposal, accepting this offer guarantees me $5,000. Given the inflation, it's likely that any further negotiation will result in an even smaller share for me. It's better to secure what I can now."
