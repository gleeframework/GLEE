600000.0,400000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a starting point. What do you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more equitable given the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",Bob,2,
,,"That's a significant jump, Bob. While I'm open to negotiation, a 60/40 split in your favor seems a bit extreme this early in the game.  Let's try to find something closer to the middle ground.",Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, how about a 55/45 split?  This factors in the inflation risk, but keeps things fair.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, with the inflation risk increasing, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  A 70/30 split is the fairest way to account for that.  Let's work together to find a solution.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I understand the inflation concern, but your demands are becoming unreasonable. This isn't a collaborative effort if you keep pushing for such a large disparity. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of getting a completely unfair deal.",Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. We're approaching the halfway point, and the value is slipping away with every round.  To stop us from both losing out, I propose a straight 50/50 split. No more games, let's just be fair and end this.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
