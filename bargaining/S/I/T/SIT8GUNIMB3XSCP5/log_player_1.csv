Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more equitable given the potential for inflation.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, with the inflation risk increasing, I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  A 70/30 split is the fairest way to account for that.  Let's work together to find a solution. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000
