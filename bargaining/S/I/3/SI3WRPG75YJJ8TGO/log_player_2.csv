Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I propose we split it 80-20. This way, you still manage to get a decent share while accounting for the decrease in value.

# Alice gain: 80
