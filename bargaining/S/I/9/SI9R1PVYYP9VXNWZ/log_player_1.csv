"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a better offer, but I'll give you a bit more this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better deal, and I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me $4,000 while giving Bob $6,000. I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground and give Bob a slightly better deal than my initial offer, but still trying to get a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really disappointed by Bob's offer. I was hoping for a better deal, and this one is quite unfair. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me only $3,000 while giving Bob $7,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a big concession, but I'm not giving up""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm trying to make a big concession and give Bob a better deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much. I'm hoping that this offer will be more appealing to Bob and that we can finally reach an agreement."
