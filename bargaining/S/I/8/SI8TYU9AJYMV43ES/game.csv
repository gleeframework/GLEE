60.0,40.0,"Bob, let's start with a reasonable split. I take $60, you get $40.  It's a good deal considering the money loses value over time.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think a 55/45 split is fairer. It gives us both a good amount, and I'm willing to give up a little more to avoid the money losing value.  What do you say?",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, the clock is ticking and that money is shrinking â€“ especially for you. I'll take a bit more this round, $65 to your $35, but let's get this settled.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
55.0,45.0,"I'm still not happy with that split, Alice. Let's meet in the middle at 45/55.  It's a fairer compromise, and we can both get a decent amount while the money is still worth something.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,accept
