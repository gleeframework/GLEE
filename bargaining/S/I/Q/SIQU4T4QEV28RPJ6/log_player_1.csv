"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but you can still get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to negotiate a bigger share for himself. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 75% of the money just yet. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering a 75/25 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a reasonable compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll get a token amount. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 1/9 share of the money. That's not a fair deal at all. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I'm not going to give up too much. This is my final offer, let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise. This is my final offer, so I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
