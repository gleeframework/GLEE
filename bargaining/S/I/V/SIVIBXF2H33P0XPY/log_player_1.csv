"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose an even split of the money. It's fair and avoids unnecessary risk in the early rounds. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is unfair, and I still have 10 rounds to negotiate a better split. I'm confident I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share slightly to acknowledge the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a more equitable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is pushing the boundaries with this offer, but I'm not ready to accept it just yet.  The inflation is getting worse, but I believe I can still get a better outcome with the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 42, ""bob_gain"": 58}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect the ongoing inflation, but I'm still aiming for a split that's more fair than Bob's last offer.  I believe we can find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfair, but I refuse to give in to his pressure. I'll keep fighting for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

The inflation is making this game increasingly difficult, but I'm willing to make another concession in hopes of reaching an agreement. I'm reducing my share further to  40, but I'm still hoping for a more equitable outcome."
