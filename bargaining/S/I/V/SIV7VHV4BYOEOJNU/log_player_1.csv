This is a fair starting point. I'm aiming for a slightly larger share because I lose less value each round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than the first round, even considering inflation. I'll reject and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm hoping he'll see the value in a fair division, especially with inflation hitting him harder."
