"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the money, leaving 30% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll reevaluate the offer.

Since my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll calculate the effective gains as follows:

My gain: 60 / 0.8 (20% less) = 75
Bob's gain: 40 / 0.9 (10% less) = 44.44

With this adjustment, I'll make my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm now offering a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this time."
