,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"Alice, your offer was quite cheeky!  Let's be fair, I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This round only - the clock is ticking and the money is losing value!",Bob,2,

75.0,25.0,"Okay, Bob, I'm willing to compromise.  This time, I'm offering a 75/25 split in my favor.  We both get a decent share, and we can avoid the risk of losing everything with more rounds. What do you think?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
50.0,50.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. 50/50, take it or leave it.  We're both losing money otherwise.",Bob,4,
