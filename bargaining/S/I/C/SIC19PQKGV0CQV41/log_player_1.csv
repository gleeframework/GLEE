"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation in future rounds if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, and the next round will see a further decrease in value for Bob's share.  It's likely he will offer an even smaller share in the future, making this offer the most beneficial for me in the long run."
