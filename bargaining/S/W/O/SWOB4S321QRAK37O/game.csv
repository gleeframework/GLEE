9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. I'm sure we can work out a better deal for both of us later on.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"You got 90% in your first offer, I'm starting with a more balanced proposal. Let's see if we can find a better deal for both of us.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference from the last round. I'll take 70% and you get 30%.  We both get more than before, and we can keep working towards a more equitable solution.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4500.0,5500.0,I'm not willing to give up too much in the early rounds. I'm trying to find a sweet spot where we can both benefit. Let's see if we can find a better balance.,Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, I'm seeing your pattern. Let's try this: I'll take 55% and you take 45%.  This feels like a fairer split considering the inflation, and we can still negotiate a better deal in the coming rounds if we're both willing to compromise.",Alice,5,
