"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 20%."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, I'd rather get a larger share now to make up for the loss. I'll reject Bob's offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```

This way, I get a larger share to compensate for the decreasing value of money."
