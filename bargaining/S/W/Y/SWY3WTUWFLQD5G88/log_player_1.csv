"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

I'm offering to take 70% of the $100, leaving Bob with 30%."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so I need to consider that when evaluating the offer.

My calculation:

* Bob's offer: Alice gain: 60, Bob gain: 40
* Due to inflation, the value of my gain is 95% of what it was in the previous round (100% - 5% = 95%)
* So, my effective gain in this round is 60 * 0.95 = 57
