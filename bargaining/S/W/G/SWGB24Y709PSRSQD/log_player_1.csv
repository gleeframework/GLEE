"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'm willing to give you a decent share.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can finish the game. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the risk of losing money if we keep going. Let's be practical. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, the new total is $9,500.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'd rather not accept a 40% share for myself. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the risks we're taking.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference this time, Alice.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think we both need to be realistic about the diminishing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 14.26% decrease in value due to inflation, the new total is $8,620.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'm not thrilled about the 50.9% share I'd be getting, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept this offer.
