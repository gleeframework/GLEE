Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think a 55/45 split favors you too much. Let's split the difference and go with 57.5/42.5.  This way, we both get a decent amount, and I can avoid the further inflation.

# Alice gain: 5750
