5500.0,4500.0,"Your offer is reasonable for a starting point, but I think a 55/45 split is more in line with the fact that the money loses value faster for me.  What do you say?",Bob,2,

5750.0,4250.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still think a 55/45 split favors you too much. Let's split the difference and go with 57.5/42.5.  This way, we both get a decent amount, and I can avoid the further inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5250.0,4750.0,"Okay, I understand your position on the previous split. How about we meet in the middle at 52.5/47.5?  It acknowledges the inflation but is still fair to both of us.",Bob,4,
