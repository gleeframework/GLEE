"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better. My initial offer of 600,000 was a fair starting point, and I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's closer to my initial proposal, but with a slight adjustment to account for the fact that Bob is willing to give me a smaller share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the initial proposal.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is the best I can do considering the initial proposal. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, I need to consider the relative value of the offer.

I'll reject this offer because it's still a 65-35 split, which is not as favorable as my initial proposal of 60-40. I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that's even closer to my initial proposal, and try to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for Bob.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the value of the money has decreased for you.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is the best I can do considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing for Bob, which is working in my favor. I'll consider this offer carefully.

I'll accept this offer because it's a 45-55 split, which is closer to my initial proposal of 60-40. While it's not ideal, I think it's a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.
