"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good split.""}\n\n### AI: Round 1\nI have proposed a division of $1,000,000 where I, Alice, receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. The message to Bob is, ""Let's be reasonable, 60-40 is a good split."" Now, it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this proposal or proceed to the next round. Please let me know Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but let's be fair. This offer accounts for the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\nConsidering the effects of inflation, the value of the money has decreased for both of us. For me, Alice, the money is worth 20% less, and for Bob, it's worth 5% less. Given Bob's offer of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for himself, along with his message emphasizing fairness and the time value of money, I must weigh the pros and cons.\n\nGiven the decreasing value of money and the fact that Bob's offer is closer to a 50-50 split but still acknowledges my initial desire for a larger share, I find the offer somewhat reasonable, especially considering the impact of inflation on future rounds. However, considering the game's structure and the fact that I initially proposed a 60-40 split in my favor, I might still have room to negotiate for a better deal in the next round, despite the risk of further inflation.\n\n### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### AI: Round 3\nGiven that we are now in Round 3 and the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced, I need to consider these impacts on the value of the money for both of us. For me, the money is worth 40% less than it was initially (due to 20% decrease in each of the first two rounds), and for Bob, it's worth 10% less (due to 5% decrease in each of the first two rounds).\n\nMy previous strategy aimed for a 60-40 split, but considering the decreasing value of money, I need to adjust my expectations while still aiming for a favorable outcome. I'll propose a division that slightly adjusts from my initial offer to account for the time value of money and the ongoing negotiations but still reflects the greater decrease in value on my side.\n\nI will propose that I receive $580,000 and Bob receives $420,000. Given the context, this offer still leans in my favor but acknowledges the shrinking pie due to inflation and the need to reach an agreement before the money's value decreases further.\n\nThe message to Bob will be, ""Considering the inflation and the offers we've both made, this seems like a more balanced split, taking into account the decreasing value of money and the need for a mutually acceptable deal.""\n\n### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation and the offers we've both made, this seems like a more balanced split, taking into account the decreasing value of money and the need for a mutually acceptable deal.""}"
