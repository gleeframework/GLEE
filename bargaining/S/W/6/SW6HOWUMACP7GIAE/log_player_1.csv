"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I believe it's a fair starting point. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Bob is being unreasonable, trying to reverse the roles completely.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a 10/90 split. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 80/20, but I'm still confident this is a fair split.  Let's see if Bob is ready to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being increasingly unreasonable.  This offer is worse than the previous round, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic shift in our favor. I'll continue to negotiate, but I'm not giving up my share this easily."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm dropping my offer to 70/30. I'm still holding firm on a decent portion of the money, but it's time for Bob to meet me halfway.  With every passing round, his gains are diminishing, and I'm confident he'll eventually accept a reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too far off from what I consider reasonable.  While his gains are decreasing, I'm holding steady.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept anything that feels like a huge loss.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 60/40. Bob's gains are decreasing with each round, and I'm showing good faith by making concessions. I hope this is enough to convince him to agree to a fair split before the value of the money continues to dwindle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn.  His gains are diminishing, and this offer is getting worse with each round.  I'm not going to accept this offer, and I'm confident that he'll eventually come around.  There are still a few rounds left, and I'm willing to see this through."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. With only a few rounds left, I believe this is the most fair and logical solution. It's time to end this stalemate and avoid further losses due to inflation."
