"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy, now it's your turn to regret 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial greed!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, $40 is actually equivalent to $36 in the first round, and $60 is equivalent to $36 as well. So, in terms of the original amount, we're essentially splitting the money 50-50.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a more modest proposal this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, and we can finally settle the division of the $100!"
