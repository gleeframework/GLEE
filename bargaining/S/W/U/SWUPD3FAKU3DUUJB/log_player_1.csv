"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can't do better than that!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can't do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting greedy, Bob. I'll give you a slightly better deal this time.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly more generous split, with me getting $420,000 and Bob getting $580,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down. You're getting closer, but still not good enough! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really eating into my potential gains!

Considering the new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think I've reached a point where the diminishing returns from inflation make this offer a good enough deal for me. I'll take the $400,000 and call it a day!"
