"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 60-40 in my favor, but I'm willing to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more. Let's see if you'll accept this offer. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll have to weigh the potential gain against the potential risk of not getting more in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20-80 split in favor of Bob, especially since the money is worth the same for me as it was in the first round. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much. 55-45 split, let's see if you'll accept.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split in my favor, which is a slightly better deal for Bob than my initial offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet. I think I can get a better deal. Let's see if you'll reconsider. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value for Bob, but he's still holding out for a better deal!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth the same for me as it was in the first round, I'll have to weigh the potential gain against the potential risk of not getting more in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30-70 split in favor of Bob, especially since the money is worth less for him than it was in the first round. I'll hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to go 50-50, but only if you accept now. Don't make me go lower.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, especially since the money is worth less for him with each passing round."
