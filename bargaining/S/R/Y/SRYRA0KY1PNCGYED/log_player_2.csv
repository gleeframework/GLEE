"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to try and get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. This is a more fair split, considering the inflation we're facing.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer is more in line with the decreasing value, Bob. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something. The inflation is becoming too much of a risk."
