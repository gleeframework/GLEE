"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm willing to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 70% but still offering a significant portion to Bob, hoping to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, even accounting for inflation. I'm sticking with my strategy of offering a fair compromise, and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm further reducing my share to 60%, but I'm still offering a substantial sum to Bob. With inflation hitting him harder each round, I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a higher share, this offer is the most fair and the best I can hope for at this point. Inflation has severely reduced Bob's bargaining power, and accepting a 50/50 split is the best outcome for both of us."
