Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation will impact Bob more heavily in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action.  The inflation will hurt Bob more significantly than me in subsequent rounds, making it unlikely I'll get a better deal.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
