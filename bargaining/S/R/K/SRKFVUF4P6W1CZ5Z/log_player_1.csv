"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started. You can do better than this, right?""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the initial amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so I need to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting 50% of the remaining $10,000, which is a fair meeting-in-the-middle proposal. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
