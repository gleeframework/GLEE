"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $45 and taking $55 for myself, with a message suggesting that this is a relatively fair split. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do a little better than that. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer. Given the inflation rates, I think I can get a better deal in the next round. The money is worth less to both of us, but it's decreasing in value faster for Bob, so I'll try to use that to my advantage. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you harder, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm taking into account the inflation rates and the fact that the money is worth less to Bob with each passing round. I'm offering him $42 and taking $58 for myself, highlighting the fact that inflation is affecting him more severely. Let's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting us nowhere. Let's split it evenly and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Bob, I think accepting the even split is the best decision at this point. The value of the money has decreased substantially, and further rounds will only continue to devalue it. By accepting this offer, I'll at least secure $50, which, although worth less than initially, is a tangible amount. Continuing the game risks losing even more value, so I'm choosing to accept and conclude the game here."
