Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it down the middle. We're both losing money with each round, and this is the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both players. Every round makes the potential gains significantly smaller.
* **Alice's Declining Share:**  Alice's share is being hit harder by inflation. Her willingness to accept a 50/50 split now suggests she might be willing to accept even less favorable terms in later rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to hold out for a better deal carries the significant risk of getting nothing if no agreement is reached. 
 
While Bob could try to push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of Alice becoming even more desperate and accepting a much lower offer later."
