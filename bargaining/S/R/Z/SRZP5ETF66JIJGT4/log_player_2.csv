"Round 1
Alice's offer:

``` 

I'm not going to accept a 60/40 split right off the bat, especially since I know the money will be worth less in the next round. Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split, considering the inflation we both need to be mindful of. Let's be reasonable and agree on this.  ""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact, I'm willing to adjust, but I still think I deserve a larger share 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still skewed in her favor, and while I understand she wants a larger share, I'm not going to accept a split that's this unequal. I need to see a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable and split the money evenly this time. Inflation is a concern for both of us, and a 50/50 split is the fairest solution in this situation.""}
