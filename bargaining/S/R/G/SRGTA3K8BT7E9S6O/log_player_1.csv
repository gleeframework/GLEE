Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it gives Bob a significant share while still allowing me to get a majority of the money.  Let's see if he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred my original proposal, I realize that the inflation is going to hurt Bob more than me.  Accepting this 50/50 split is the best way to ensure I get a fair share, as things will only get worse for Bob in the next round."
