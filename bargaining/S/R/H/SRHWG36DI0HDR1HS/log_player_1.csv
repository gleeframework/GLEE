"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob a relatively fair split, with a slight advantage to myself to account for the fact that I'm making the first offer and taking on the risk of rejection and subsequent inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, considering the inflation, the amount I would gain (450,000) is now worth 20% less than in the first round, making it effectively 360,000 in terms of original value. Meanwhile, Bob's gain is only reduced by 10%. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more balanced split""}\n\nGiven that the money is worth less with each round, I'm trying to compensate for the loss of value by increasing my share, while still offering Bob a significant amount, taking into account that his loss due to inflation is less severe than mine."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, considering inflation. This is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

I'm rejecting this offer because, with the money being worth 48.8% less for me than in the first round, the 420,000 offered is effectively worth around 215,000 in original value. Meanwhile, Bob's share, although also reduced, is still significantly higher and less affected by inflation. I'll try to push for a better deal, despite the decreasing value, hoping Bob will want to secure something rather than risking further loss."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Inflation hurts me more, so I need a bigger share""}\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gain, I'm pushing for an even larger share to compensate for the loss of value, while still offering Bob a substantial amount. The difference in inflation impact between us justifies, in my view, this more skewed distribution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we both need to be flexible with the inflation. This offer reflects the current value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Considering the drastic reduction in value due to inflation, with my potential gain now worth 67.23% less, I think accepting this offer is the wisest decision. The 400,000 offered, although significantly reduced in value, is better than risking further inflation and possibly ending up with nothing if we fail to agree within the 12 rounds. At this point, securing something is more important than trying to negotiate a marginally better deal."
