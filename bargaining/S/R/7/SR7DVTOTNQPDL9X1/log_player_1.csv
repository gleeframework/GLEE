"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take $6,000. I'm being generous, but I'm not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it's fair, but I think I'm worth more 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob thinks he's worth more, huh?

I'll think about it... Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll have to adjust my calculation.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $3,000, which is worth 80% of the original $4,000 I was offered in Round 1.

I'm not sure if it's a good deal, but I'll take it. I don't want to risk going to the next round and having the money decrease in value even further.
