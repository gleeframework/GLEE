"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I think this is a fair starting point, considering Bob's money is worth less with each round.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I understand the inflation affects him more, his offer is far too unfair.  I am willing to negotiate, but a 20/80 split is unacceptable."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I recognize that Bob's money is depreciating faster, I need to ensure a more equitable share for myself as well.  Let's try to reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is becoming more reasonable.  I am willing to accept this 45/55 split to avoid further rounds of negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
