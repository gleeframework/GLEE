Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's previous offer was 60, I'll try to do better. I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Alice, considering the inflation effect. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","Alice's offer is similar to my previous offer, but with a slight adjustment. Considering the inflation effect, I'll think carefully before making a decision. I'll accept this offer.
