"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
This way, I get the majority, but Bob still gets a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of money decreasing, I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. I reject Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```
This way, I'm trying to get a slightly higher share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
