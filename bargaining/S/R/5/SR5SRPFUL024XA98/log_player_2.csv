Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 60/40 split feels more balanced considering the time constraints. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, accepting 40% now would set a precedent for her to continue lowballing me.  It's worth risking another round to aim for a better outcome, even with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement towards a more balanced split. However, I need you to meet me closer to the middle. This offer reflects the urgency of the situation while still acknowledging your position.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer shows I'm willing to negotiate but won't accept a lowball deal. The 65/35 split is a strong counter-offer to her 60/40.
* **Time Pressure:** Highlighting the time pressure (and increasing inflation) keeps the negotiation moving.  Alice needs to understand that her potential gains are shrinking rapidly.
* **Aiming for Round 5/6:**  My goal is to get Alice to propose something around 60/40 in her favor by Round 5 or 6.  At that point, the inflation will make her offer more appealing to me, and I can accept a slightly less favorable split."
