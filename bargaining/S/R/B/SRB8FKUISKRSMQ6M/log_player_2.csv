"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I want the lion's share.  Let's end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what kind of offer Alice will make next!  Even with inflation, I can likely do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""This is a fair split, considering the inflation. Let's call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than that.  Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, inflation is starting to eat away at my potential gains.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something."
