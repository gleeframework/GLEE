I'm not sure if Alice is aware of the inflation, but 6000 for her and only 4000 for me is not a good deal.  I'll see if I can get a better offer."

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  Since we're both aware of inflation, I think this is a fair deal that gives us both a decent share of the money."
