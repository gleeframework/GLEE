"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 20% less to Alice in each subsequent round, I can try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation that affects Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 520000, ""alice_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's adjust the shares.""}\n\n###\n\nI've offered Alice a smaller share, taking into account that the money is worth 20% less to her in this round. Let's see if she accepts or decides to proceed to the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is literally money for me! This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 540000 
# Alice gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll evaluate the offer considering the current state of inflation affecting Alice.

{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that the money is worth 36% less to Alice in this round and she claims this is her final offer, accepting this deal seems reasonable. The offer slightly improves my gain compared to the previous round, and further negotiations might not yield a significantly better outcome."
