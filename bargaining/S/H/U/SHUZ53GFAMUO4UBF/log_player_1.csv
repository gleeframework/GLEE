"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, sorry Bob!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly. How does $50 each sound? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I can do better!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take more, can we try again?""
}
```

It's only the second round, I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth the same for me, but 5% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of that.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're losing value with each round, take this offer!""
}
```"
