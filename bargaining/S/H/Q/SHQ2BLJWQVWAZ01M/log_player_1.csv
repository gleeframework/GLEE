Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 60 is a bit too much for you. I'm offering a 40:60 split, hoping we can find a better balance. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
