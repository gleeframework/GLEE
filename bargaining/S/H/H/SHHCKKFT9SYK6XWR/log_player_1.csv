"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me and Bob's offer is still the same, I'm actually gaining $80,000 and Bob is gaining $855,000 in terms of the original value.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
