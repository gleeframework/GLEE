"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50/50 is a good starting point. Your turn to consider! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $5000 is actually worth $5000 / 1.1 = $4545.55.

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, 50/50 it is! Let's shake on it, Bob.""
}
```"
