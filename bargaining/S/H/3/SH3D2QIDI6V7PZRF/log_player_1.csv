"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. You can't do better than this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which means I'd get $6,000 and Bob would get $4,000. I'm confident this is a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
