"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's finish the game!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the money equally, 50/50. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiation."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower share, but it's still a good deal. Let's not waste time! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll focus on the absolute values. With this offer, I'd be getting $300,000, which is less than what I initially proposed. I'll have to weigh the potential benefits of accepting this offer against the potential gains I could get in future rounds.

For now, I'll reject the offer and proceed to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to increase my chances of getting a better deal.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if you'll accept this offer!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant portion of the money. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiation."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent deal. Don't make me go lower! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to take that into account when evaluating the offer. However, the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round.

With this offer, I'd be getting $400,000, which is a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll think twice before accepting.

For now, I'll reject the offer and proceed to the next round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance. I think this is a fair share, and I'm willing to walk away if you don't accept.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiation. I'm willing to take a risk and see if Bob will accept this offer."
