"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent share. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations. Bob's offer is a bit more generous than my initial one, but I'm still not getting the majority of the money.

I'll reject this offer for now.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44}

This time, I'm offering a slightly smaller share to myself, but still aiming to get a larger portion of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. With the money worth 27.1% less than initially, I need to be more cautious.

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal considering the decreased value of the money. I'll accept this offer to avoid further rounds and the continued erosion of the money's value.
