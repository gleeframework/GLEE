"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal.  I think this split is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob should reject this offer. While it seems like a fair deal at first glance, the inflation factor plays a huge role in this game.  Bob has 12 rounds to negotiate, and each round sees his share of the money decrease by 10%. By rejecting this offer, Bob keeps the possibility open to get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. This is the fairest way to start, considering the inflation factor.""}
