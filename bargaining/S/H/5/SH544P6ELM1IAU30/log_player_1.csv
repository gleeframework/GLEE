Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 45 dollars and keep 55 dollars for myself. My message to Bob is ""Let's be fair"".\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I'd actually be getting 45 dollars in ""real value"" if we split it evenly. I think I can get a better deal. Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but it's still fair considering the inflation""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 42 dollars and keep 58 dollars for myself. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. My message to Bob is ""I'll give you a bit less, but it's still fair considering the inflation"".\n\nYour turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hurting us both. Let's split it more in my favor this time, but I'm willing to give you a bit more than last round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me in this round, I'd actually be getting approximately 32.85 dollars in ""real value"" if I accept this offer. Considering the increasing effects of inflation, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking another round and losing even more value. Your turn!"
