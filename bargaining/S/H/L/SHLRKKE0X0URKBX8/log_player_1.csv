"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy, now it's your turn to be reasonable! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I didn't expect Bob to reject my initial offer, but I'm willing to negotiate.

Considering the inflation effect, I'm not too thrilled about the 30-70 split. However, I don't want to be seen as being unreasonable, so I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
