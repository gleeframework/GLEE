"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and end this quickly before inflation hits us!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting to be fair, but let's find a compromise. This offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think Bob's offer is still not fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of another round to try to get a better deal. Bring on Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
