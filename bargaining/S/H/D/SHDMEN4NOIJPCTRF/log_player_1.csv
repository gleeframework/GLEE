"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this quickly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less after the first round, I now have $5,400 ($6,000 x 0.9) and Bob has $3,600 ($4,000 x 0.9).

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll accept it. The offer is a 50-50 split, which is reasonable, and I'd rather end the game quickly.
