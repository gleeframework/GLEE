"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed Alice. How about we meet closer to the middle? This deal accounts for the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you want closer to the middle, but the inflation hurts me more. This offer is a compromise, taking future rounds into account.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  We're both losing money with every round. Let's settle this fairly before the inflation eats away at the pot. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is still slightly in his favor, the ongoing inflation is eroding the value of the money significantly. Accepting 5300 now is better than risking further losses in future rounds, even if I could potentially negotiate a slightly better deal."
