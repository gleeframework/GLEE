Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. 57-43 is my new offer. Time is running out, let's make a deal. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is right, time is running out, she is still not acknowledging the significant impact inflation has on my end of the deal. Accepting now would mean losing out on a much larger chunk of the potential value. I need to hold firm and hope she becomes more reasonable in the next round or two."
