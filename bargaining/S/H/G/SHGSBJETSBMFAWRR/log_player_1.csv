"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob. My message to Bob is to propose a fair and reasonable split, and to see if he's willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, the money is worth 20% less, so I'd gain $400,000 x 0.8 = $320,000. Bob's offer is still $400,000, but it's worth the same as in Round 1.

Considering the offer, I'd rather not accept a 60-40 split in Bob's favor, especially since it's not even a good deal for me in terms of the actual value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value, so I'd gain $400,000 x 0.8 x 0.8 = $256,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than last time. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining value, which is $256,000 x 0.7 = $179,200, and leaving $76,800 for Bob. My message to Bob is to see if he's willing to meet me in the middle."
