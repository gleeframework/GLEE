"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering to take 80 dollars and leave 20 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I'll think about the value of the money in terms of its purchasing power. In the first round, I would have gotten 80 dollars, which is worth 80 / (1 - 0.2) = 100 dollars in terms of its purchasing power. Now, in this round, Bob is offering me 70 dollars, which is worth 70 / (1 - 0.2) = 87.5 dollars in terms of its purchasing power. That's a good deal!

I accept Bob's offer.
