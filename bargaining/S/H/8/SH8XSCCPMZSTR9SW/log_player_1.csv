"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer.  I'll take 999,999 dollars and leave Bob with just 1 dollar.  It's unlikely he'll accept, but this sets the stage for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, this is a fair offer and I don't want to risk getting less in future rounds due to inflation."
