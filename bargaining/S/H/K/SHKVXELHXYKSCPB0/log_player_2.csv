Let's see what I can get in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if she accepts my offer!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair split, and I'm not sure I'll get a better deal later, given the inflation."
