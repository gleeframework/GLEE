Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, the money loses value with each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, and I'm not willing to accept less than half of the money. The inflation warning from Bob doesn't scare me... yet! Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, inflation is coming!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $48 and taking $52 for myself, with a message that suggests meeting in the middle and acknowledging the pressure of inflation. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer before the money loses even more value!"
