"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60% for me, 40% for you""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is $400,000, and I'll take 60%, which is $600,000. I think this is a reasonable offer considering we're just starting the game. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a bit more than that. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer of $550,000 for me and $450,000 for him. Considering the inflation, my share is actually worth less than it was in the first round. I think I can negotiate a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob $420,000 and take $580,000 for myself. Since the money is worth 5% less for me in each round, I'm actually losing value if we keep negotiating. I hope Bob will accept this offer, considering it's still a relatively good deal for him.\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm being generous. Take it or leave it!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing for both of us. This feels like a good compromise to me. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer of $525,000 for me and $475,000 for him. Although the inflation has reduced the value of my share, I think this is a reasonable compromise, and further negotiation might lead to an even worse deal due to the decreasing value of the money. So, I'll take this offer and end the game here.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
