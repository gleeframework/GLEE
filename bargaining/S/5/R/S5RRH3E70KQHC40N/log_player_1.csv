"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $600,000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $400,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, since the money will be worth less for you in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting move by Bob! Since the money is worth less for me in this round, I'm willing to accept a slightly smaller share. However, I'm not thrilled about giving up the extra 200,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
