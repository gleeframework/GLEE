Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45. It's better than getting nothing, and we still have plenty of rounds left. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55

Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The value is dropping fast.  I'm sticking with $60/$40. It's a fair deal considering the circumstances.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I see your point. Let's split it 60/40. It's not ideal, but it's better than the current trajectory. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```
Alice has finally agreed to my $60/$40 split, even though it's in her favor now.  Better to take the deal than risk getting nothing as inflation eats away at the value.
