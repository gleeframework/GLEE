"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original $100, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the offer from Bob, I'd get 60% of the original $100, but due to inflation, it's equivalent to 60% of $95 (since 100 * 0.95 = 95). So, I'd get $57, and Bob would get $38.

I'll accept this offer.
