This is a tough one!  Here's why I'm choosing to accept, even though it's not ideal:

* **Severe Inflation Impact:** The inflation is hitting me much harder than Bob. Waiting any longer means I'll lose even more value.
* **Better Than Nothing:** While I'd prefer a larger share, 4500 is better than nothing, which is what I risk if I keep rejecting and the game goes on. 
* **Bob's Stance:**  His ""final offer"" message suggests he's unlikely to budge further.

It's a gamble either way, but at this point, cutting my losses feels like the most strategic move."
