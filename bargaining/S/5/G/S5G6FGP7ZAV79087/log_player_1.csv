"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob. No need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, you get a decent chunk. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I think I can do better than this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give up too much.""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself, while still offering Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not giving up enough, I want more. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less for Bob with each round, so I think I can afford to give up a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can finalize the division of the money."
