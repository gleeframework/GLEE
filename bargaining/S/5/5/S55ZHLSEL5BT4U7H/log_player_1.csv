"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a deal early and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is not good for me.  It's less than I offered him in the first round, and the inflation means I'm losing a significant portion of my potential earnings. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount. I need to get a deal done quickly to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a difficult decision.  While this offer is better than what I'd receive if we fail to reach an agreement, it's still significantly lower than the initial amount I offered Bob.  I'm going to risk it and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm making another concession, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  I'm hoping this offer is enough to get Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable. While it's more than what I'd get if we fail to reach an agreement, it's significantly lower than what I had hoped for. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  Inflation is really hurting, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm making another concession, but time is running out.  Inflation is really starting to bite.  I'm hoping Bob will finally see the value in coming to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision.  While the offer is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, the continued inflation is making the potential payout so small that I'm better off taking this offer. It's still a decent amount of money, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
