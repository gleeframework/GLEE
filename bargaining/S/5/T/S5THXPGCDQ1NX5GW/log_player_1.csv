Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, giving Bob a small percentage. This is a risky move, but it's a good way to see if he's willing to be cooperative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher share, it's more beneficial to accept this offer than risk getting nothing due to the decreasing value of the money. It's a fair split, and I can't be certain what Bob might offer in the following rounds."
