"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven split! While I understand starting with a proposal, hoping I'd accept out of fear of losing everything, this is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but Alice needs to offer something much fairer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. It benefits us both to agree sooner rather than later.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still need a bigger share. Let's go with 85/15 this time. We're running out of rounds! 
# Bob gain: 1500 
# Alice gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is barely budging!  While the time pressure is on, accepting a 15% share when the value is already decreasing significantly for me would be foolish. I need to hold firm and show I'm serious about a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm lowering my share to 55% to reach a deal.  We both lose if this fails, and time is running out!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer, Bob.  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I won't go any lower. It's better to get something than risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is incredibly frustrating! Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation and the decreasing value of the money for me. However, accepting a mere 20% when it's already worth so much less is a terrible deal. I'd rather gamble on myself and hope she gets nervous as we get closer to the deadline."

{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it. I'm done playing games. We both lose if we don't agree now!""}
