"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit less than half, but still a significant amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can avoid the inflation penalty. Let me know what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share for being the proposer this round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share.""
}

I've reduced my share slightly, but still think I should get a bit more than Bob. Let's see what he thinks!"
