"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we're both taking a hit from inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'm not sure if a 55/45 split is the best deal for me. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better share. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 5% toll, the money is worth less now. I'll propose a slightly more favorable split for myself to account for the decreasing value of money.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
