"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer of a 50/50 split, but I think it's important to recognize that delaying agreement comes at a cost for me due to inflation. How about we try a 60/40 split in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
