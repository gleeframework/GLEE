"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! You're getting a generous offer.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. This is a relatively high offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice.  I'm offering a more equitable split.  Accept this, and we both get something.  Reject, and we both lose more with each passing round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's proposal, I've decided to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the split, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for Bob's next offer, and hope to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob. Take this, or we'll both lose big time!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $7,000 and leaving $3,000 for Bob. I'm trying to be more aggressive this round, hoping to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer.  We're both losing money with every passing round.  Let's end this now before it's too late.  Accept, and we both get a decent share.  Reject, and we both risk getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting higher!

After considering Bob's proposal, I've decided to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get, and I'm willing to take the risk of losing even more money in the next round to try to get a better deal. I'm not ready to settle for this offer just yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. This is my last chance to get a decent deal. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I'm trying to be more realistic about the value of the money, considering the inflation, and hoping that Bob will accept this offer to avoid losing even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing out here. I'm willing to give you a little more, but this is my final offer.  It's time to stop this cycle of rejections and reach a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The offers are getting more and more desperate!

After considering Bob's proposal, I've decided to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get, and I'm still hoping to negotiate a better deal. I'm not willing to settle for this offer just yet, even if it means risking even more losses in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""It's time to split the difference, Bob. This is my last chance to get a fair deal. Take it, or we'll both lose big time!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is the most equitable option at this point. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can finally end the game."
