"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate later.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the money and Bob gets 10%. I'm being generous, but I'm also aware that the game is just starting, and I want to set a baseline for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's both get a good share.  I'm willing to split it more evenly, but I'm sure you understand the value of this game is decreasing with each round.  
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing with each round, so I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too generous. I'll make a counteroffer: 700000 for me, 300000 for you. It's time to be realistic about the value of the money.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less than in the second round, so I need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 630000,
  ""bob_gain"": 370000,
  ""message"": ""You're not taking this seriously, are you? I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to go easy on you.""
}
```"
