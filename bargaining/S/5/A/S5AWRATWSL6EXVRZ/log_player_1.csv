"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 90% to me, 10% to you. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way, we both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to split it evenly just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of money decreasing by 20% again, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, Bob. 70% to me, 30% to you. This way, I can get a bit more, but we can still move forward.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to give you 40% to ensure we can both agree. This is a fair compromise given the inflation affecting your side. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think 40% is a reasonable compromise, especially considering the effects of inflation on my end. I'd rather accept this deal and move on."
