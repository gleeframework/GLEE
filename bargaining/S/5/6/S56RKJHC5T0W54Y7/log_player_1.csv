"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 80:20 ratio, a fair division with a slight bias towards my end, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
