Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your need for a bigger share due to the faster inflation, but I'm proposing a slightly more even split to account for the fact that I also lose money with each passing round.  Let's find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
