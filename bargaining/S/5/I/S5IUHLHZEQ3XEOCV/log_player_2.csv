"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I take the lion's share, but I'll give you a decent cut.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With 20% inflation, the money will be worth less, but I'm hoping to get a better deal than 10% of the original amount. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more in my favor, considering the 20% inflation that's already reduced the value of the money. Here's my proposal:\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's split the reduced value fairly.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more than last time.  This offer reflects the reduced value, but still leaves us both with a good amount.  Let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. Even though the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","With the money now worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to make an offer that takes this into account while still trying to get a decent share. Here's my proposal:\n{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting us hard, let's split what's left 50/50 to minimize losses.""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see if Alice will accept this offer!"
