Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob.  I figure he might accept this, and even if not, it'll give me a good baseline for future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to have more than $50, it's better to take what I can get.  Bob's offer is fair, and if I reject it, I run the risk of ending up with nothing in the later rounds."
