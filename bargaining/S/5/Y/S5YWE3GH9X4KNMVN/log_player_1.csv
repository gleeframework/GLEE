"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, which is $6,000, and Bob will take 40%, which is $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50-50, a fair and simple solution 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $4,800 in the second round.

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but it's a fair and simple solution. I'll accept Bob's offer.
