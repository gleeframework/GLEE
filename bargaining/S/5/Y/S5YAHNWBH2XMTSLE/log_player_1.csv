I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, aiming to secure the deal quickly.  Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse than what I offered him in the first round, even after accounting for inflation. I'm not going to accept that. I'll make a better proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I'm still giving Bob a decent share. I'm hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept, considering the increasing inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round.  While the inflation is hitting me harder, I'm still confident I can get a better deal than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a larger share. Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable, and I need to secure something before the inflation hits me too hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting even worse, and the inflation is hitting me hard.  However, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal than this. I'm going to hold out and see if I can get Bob to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

The inflation is getting serious now, but I'm still trying to secure a good portion of the money.  I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that we're both losing value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are getting worse, and the inflation is really hitting me hard.  I'm still going to reject this offer, though.  He's going to have to offer me more if he wants to secure a deal before the money is worthless."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

We're both losing a lot of value with each round. I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is the fairest option at this point.  I hope Bob will realize that it's in our best interest to end this game before we both get nothing."
