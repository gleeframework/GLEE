"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

Considering the new values, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 5000 * 0.8 = 4000 (due to 20% inflation)
Bob's gain: 5000 * 0.95 = 4750 (due to 5% inflation)

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best option, considering the inflation rates. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share due to the inflation. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```

I'm trying to adjust the split to account for the inflation, but I'm still not giving up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, Alice, but I think this is the highest I can go. Let's see if you're willing to meet me here. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: 5200 * 0.516 = 2684.8 (due to 48.8% inflation)
Bob's gain: 4800 * 0.855 = 4104 (due to 14.26% inflation)

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the significant inflation. However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with even lower potential earnings.
