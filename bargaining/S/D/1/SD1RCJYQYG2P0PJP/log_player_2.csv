I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a more even split, hoping Alice will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the money is worth less, I'm taking the deal. There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and with inflation, the money will continue to decrease in value."
