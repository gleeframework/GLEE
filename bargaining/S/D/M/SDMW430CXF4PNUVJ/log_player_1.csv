"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a different division. I'll take 475000 and you'll receive 525000. This way, we both get more than what we would in the long run due to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
