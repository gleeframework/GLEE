"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got a great start, can you do better than even? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll consider the effective gains in the new round. If I accept Bob's offer, I'll be getting 4000, which is equivalent to 5000 in the first round, considering the inflation.

I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up more than half of the total amount, but I'll consider the fact that Bob is trying to negotiate. I'll try to make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I can do better than that, let's try again""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer is now worth 64% of its original value (since 20% less in two rounds is 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I'm not giving up too much""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit impatient, can we speed up the negotiations? 
# Alice gain: 2800 
# Bob gain: 7200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 51.2% of its original value (since 20% less in four rounds is 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.512).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think carefully. If I accept, I'll be getting 2800, which is equivalent to 5625 in the first round, considering the inflation. It's a significant concession from my previous offer, but I'm trying to move the negotiations forward.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping to get a better deal in future rounds.
