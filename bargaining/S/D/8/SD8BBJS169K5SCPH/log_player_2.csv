"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly! Seems fair, right? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd rather try to get a better deal, considering the inflation rate is higher for me. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55 for me and 45 for you?""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is hitting you harder, but let's be reasonable.  I'll give you 52, but I need at least 48 to make it worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 52 
# Alice gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nWhile Alice's offer is slightly better, considering the higher inflation rate affecting me, I believe I can negotiate for a more favorable split in the next rounds. The difference isn't enough to compensate for the value I'm losing due to inflation. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is really biting into my share. I need a bit more to make it fair. How about 58 for me and 42 for you? It's the best I can do considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Look, inflation is tough for both of us. This is my final offer - 55 for you, 45 for me.  Let's settle this before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, Alice's offer of 55 for me and 45 for her seems reasonable at this point. Continuing to negotiate risks losing even more value, so I'll accept this offer to secure what I can."
