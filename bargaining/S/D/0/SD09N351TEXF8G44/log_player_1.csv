"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40 dollars and keep 60 dollars for myself. Since the money doesn't lose value for Bob, he might be inclined to accept this offer. But since the value of money decreases by 20% for me with each passing round, I want to try to end the game as soon as possible to maximize my gain.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's go with 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less for me in this round, I would actually receive 32 dollars (80% of 40 dollars). I'm not happy with this offer, so I'll reject it and try to get a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""}\n\nIn this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round for me, and 40% less than in the first round. I'll offer Bob 45 dollars and keep 55 dollars for myself. Since the value of money is decreasing rapidly for me, I'm willing to compromise and offer Bob a larger share than before. I hope he'll accept this offer and end the game.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since inflation is hurting you more, I'm willing to take a bit more to even things out.  Let's go with 65/35. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn this round, the money is worth 51.2% of its original value for me (100% - 20% - 20% - 20% = 51.2% of the original value, but since it is 48.8% less, then it is 100% - 48.8% = 51.2%). So if I accept this offer, I would actually receive approximately 17.92 dollars (51.2% of 35 dollars). Considering the rapidly decreasing value of money for me, I think it's better to accept this offer and end the game rather than risking an even worse deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome!"
