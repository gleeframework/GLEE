Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We're losing money with each round, so it's in both our best interests to agree now. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nAlice is right, we are losing money with each round. Splitting it evenly seems fair, and it's better to agree now than to risk losing more value in the next rounds."
