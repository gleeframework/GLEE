"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about the inflation effect on my end. However, I notice that Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, which means he's getting a relatively larger share of the pie.

I'm willing to compromise, but I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and propose a new one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm trying to find a middle ground between our previous offers. I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let me analyze the new offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about the inflation effect on my end. However, I notice that Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which means he's getting a relatively smaller share of the pie.

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair split. I'll take the 450,000 and Bob can take the 550,000.
