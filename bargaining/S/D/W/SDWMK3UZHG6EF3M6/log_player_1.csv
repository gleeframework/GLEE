Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money and keeping 60% for myself. I think this is a reasonable offer, considering I'm the one making the first proposal. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer of only 30% of the money. Considering the inflation, I think I deserve a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round. Bring it on!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Come on, Bob, meet me halfway!""}\n\nI'm taking into account the inflation and offering Bob a slightly better deal than before. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll offer Bob 42% of the original amount. Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. The clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think 35% of the original amount is a reasonable compromise at this point. I'd rather take this offer than risk losing even more value in the next round. Time to wrap up the game!
