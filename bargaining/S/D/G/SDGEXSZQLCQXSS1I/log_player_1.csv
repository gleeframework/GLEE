"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 ratio, where I get 80% and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'm not thrilled about this offer. However, I'm willing to compromise.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will be more willing to negotiate further in future rounds.
