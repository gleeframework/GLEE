# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""
