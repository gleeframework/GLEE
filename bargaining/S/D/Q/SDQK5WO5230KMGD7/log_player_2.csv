"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll offer you 30% of the money, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her and better for me. While the value of the money is decreasing, holding out for a better offer still makes sense. She'll be even more desperate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time. I'll agree to your original offer of 60/40 to get this done."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly, especially for Alice. We're now in round 4 of 12, and the pressure is on.
* **Alice's Desperation:** Alice's offer in round 3 (70/30) was significantly worse than her opening offer (60/40). This suggests she's feeling the pressure and might be willing to settle.
* **Strategic Concession:** By accepting her original offer, I appear reasonable and willing to compromise. This might make her more likely to accept, avoiding further losses for both of us."
