Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to divide the money. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to make sure I get a fair share as well. This offer is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While this offer is closer to a 50/50 split after Bob's gains are adjusted for my inflation, it's still not in my best interest.  Bob is banking on me getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into my potential gains. I need to hold out for a better offer, but time is running out!"

Round 5

{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand inflation is hurting us both, but we can still find a fair solution. This offer gives you more than the last round, and still leaves me with a decent share. Let's end this now and avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**  This is a tricky one. Bob is right that further inflation will hurt us both, but it's clear he's trying to take advantage of the situation. Accepting this offer would mean I get less than a 50/50 split after adjusting for inflation.  I need to show I'm serious about getting a fair deal, even if it means risking another round."
