"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nIn the first round, I'll offer Bob 40% of the money, which is $400,000, and I'll take 60%, which is $600,000. The message to Bob is ""Let's divide fairly"". I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer since it's a reasonable split, but we'll see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer gives me $400,000, which is now worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual value first. The original $400,000 is now worth $380,000. Considering Bob's offer and the impact of inflation, I'll decide to reject this offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round or that my initial offer was more reasonable.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, considering the impact of inflation on both of us, I'll adjust my offer slightly to make it more appealing to Bob while still being favorable to me. I'll offer Bob 45% of the money and take 55% for myself. Given the inflation, the actual value for both of us will be less, but the percentage split remains the focus for the offer.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle""}\n\nI hope this revised offer is more acceptable to Bob, considering we both lose value with each passing round."
