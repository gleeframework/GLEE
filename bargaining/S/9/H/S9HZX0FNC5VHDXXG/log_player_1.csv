"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, with the message ""Let's split fairly"". This is a reasonable starting point, as I'm giving Bob a significant share while also taking into account the inflation penalty that affects us both. The message is brief and to the point, encouraging Bob to accept a fair split and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I propose an even split. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer of an even split. While it may seem fair at first glance, I have to consider the inflation penalty. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, an even split is actually slightly more favorable to Bob. Additionally, I started with a 55-45 split in my favor, so accepting an even split would mean I'm giving up some ground without a good reason to do so. I'll make a new proposal in the next round to try to find a more favorable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nI'll make a new proposal that takes into account the inflation penalty and the fact that Bob was willing to accept an even split. I'll offer a 52-48 split in my favor, which is slightly more generous than my initial offer but still reflects the fact that the money is worth more to me than to Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fair compromise""}\n\n###\n\nThis message acknowledges the impact of inflation and frames my offer as a compromise between our previous proposals. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's settle this.  This offer accounts for the inflation so far. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob claims that the offer accounts for inflation, the actual numbers don't quite add up in my favor. Considering that the money is worth 14.26% less to me and 27.1% less to Bob, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a new proposal in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us. Since the money is worth less to both of us, I'll propose a slightly more even split, while still considering the greater decrease in value for Bob.

{""alice_gain"": 5100, ""bob_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Inflation is hurting us both, let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nThis message acknowledges the shared impact of inflation and frames my offer as a compromise that finds a middle ground between our interests. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, ending the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4700 
# Bob gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob claims that this is his final offer, I'm not convinced that he won't continue negotiating if I reject it. Considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a new proposal in the next round, taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since the money is worth less to both of us, I'll propose a slightly more even split, while still considering the greater decrease in value for Bob.

It's worth noting that the game is reaching its midpoint, and the pressure to reach an agreement is increasing. However, I still believe that I can negotiate a better deal, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the game to try to achieve that."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll make an offer that takes into account the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money for both of us.

{""alice_gain"": 5050, ""bob_gain"": 4950, ""message"": ""We're running out of time, let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nThis message acknowledges the time pressure and frames my offer as a compromise that finds a middle ground between our interests. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, ending the game.

I've decided to offer a nearly even split, with a slight advantage to myself, in the hopes that Bob will see this as a fair compromise and accept it. The message emphasizes the time pressure, which may help to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept the offer."
