"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a decent share, but I think 3:1 is too extreme. Let's try 3:2 instead. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
