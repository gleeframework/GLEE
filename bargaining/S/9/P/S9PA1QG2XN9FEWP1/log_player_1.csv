"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial offer was quite low. This way, I'll get a decent chunk and you'll still get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{

  ""bob_gain"": 40,
