"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and we can adjust from there.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not going to give away too much just yet. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values. Bob's offer is a 40/60 split, which is a bit worse for me than the 50/50 split I proposed initially.

However, I'm not eager to risk waiting for a better offer, and I don't want to give Bob too much more room to negotiate. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I won't regret it later.
