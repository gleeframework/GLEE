"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm starting with a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer... Hmm, I'd rather not give up as much as 40% of the total, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation is taking its toll! The money is worth 40% less now.

Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm trying to balance my gain with the decreasing value of the money, while also considering the fact that Bob's offer was 40/60 in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really biting now!

Considering the value of the money has decreased by 48.8% from the initial amount, I'm getting a bit desperate. However, I still think 35/65 is a bit too skewed towards Bob.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money is worth even less now. I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer.

Here's my revised offer for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm trying to take a bit more, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on me now! The money is worth a whopping 67.23% less than the initial amount!

Considering the drastic decrease in value, I'm getting quite desperate. Bob's offer is actually a relatively small difference from the previous rounds, but I'm not sure if I can afford to be picky at this point.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
