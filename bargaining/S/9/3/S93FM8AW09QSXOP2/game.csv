900000.0,100000.0,I propose a fair deal. I take 90% and leave 10% for you. We both get something. What do you say?,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
100000.0,900000.0,"I'm willing to be generous this time, but let's work towards a more equitable split in the future.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
700000.0,300000.0,I'm still not satisfied with a 10/90 split. Let's try a 70/30 split.  This gives you a significant share and ensures we both get a decent amount before inflation eats away at the money.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a larger share this time, but I still need a substantial amount to make it worthwhile. Let's try a 60/40 split.",Bob,4,
