"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal for both of us considering the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me less than half the money, especially with the time pressure and the fact that Alice's money is depreciating faster than mine. I'm going to counteroffer and see if she's willing to be more fair."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest option considering the inflation and the limited rounds.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is a reasonable offer, slightly better for me but still fair to you. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still not happy with this offer. It's better for me than the first offer, but I'm still getting less than half, and Alice's money is depreciating faster. I'm going to counteroffer again."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""Alice, we need to be more efficient. Let's split it closer to even, I'm willing to give you a slight advantage to avoid further rounds and wasted money.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable but I need a better deal. This offer considers the inflation we both face. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with this offer. While Alice's money is depreciating much faster, I'm still getting less than half and the inflation is significantly impacting my share. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to a 50/50 split."
