Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money a bit closer to the middle. This way we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is closer to an even split, it's still skewed in his favor.  I'm willing to hold out for a slightly better deal, knowing that the money will be worth even less next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 55,

""message"": ""Okay Bob, let's try this again. I'll take a bit less this time, but I still need a bit more than you. How about 55% for me?""
