"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nMy reasoning is that since I'm the one making the first offer, I want to start with a slightly higher amount for myself, but still leave a reasonable amount for Bob. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him more likely to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a bit more, but this is more balanced.  Let's close this deal and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nMy reasoning is that, considering the inflation, the offer of $45 for me is actually worth less than its face value, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Additionally, Bob's message seems to be trying to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not convinced that this is the best offer I can get. I'll take my chances and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more.""}\n\nMy reasoning is that, taking into account the 20% decrease in value for me, I'm willing to compromise and offer a slightly lower amount for myself, but still want to maintain a slight advantage. The message is an attempt to show Bob that I'm willing to listen to his concerns and find a middle ground, while still advocating for my own interests."
