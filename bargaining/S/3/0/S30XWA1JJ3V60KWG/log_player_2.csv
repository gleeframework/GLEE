Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a 55/45 split is fairer. It accounts for the inflation you're facing, but still gives us both a decent share.
