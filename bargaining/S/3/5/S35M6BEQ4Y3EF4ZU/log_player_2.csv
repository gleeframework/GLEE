Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 570000

**Reasoning:**

The effects of inflation are getting severe. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, rejecting it means risking an even lower offer in future rounds where the money will be worth even less to me.  It's better to take a less than ideal offer now than risk getting a much worse outcome later."
