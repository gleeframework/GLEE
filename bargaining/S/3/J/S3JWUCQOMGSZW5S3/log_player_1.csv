"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 gain from the first round is now worth $5,400.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with splitting it exactly down the middle, especially since I've already proposed a more favorable split for myself in the first round. However, I don't want to reject this offer without considering it carefully.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
