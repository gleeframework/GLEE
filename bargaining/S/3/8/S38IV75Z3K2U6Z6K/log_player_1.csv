"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. I'm feeling generous, so I'll offer you a significant portion. However, time is money, and it's in both our best interests to settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly less than my initial offer.  Since the value of his money is depreciating faster than mine, it's in my best interest to continue to push for a better deal.  I believe I can still get more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise.  This offer is still fair, but it reflects the changing value of the money.  Let's make this happen before we both lose more!""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair and simple deal. 50/50 split. Let's end this now before inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd still prefer a slightly larger share, it's getting increasingly risky to hold out. The value of Bob's money is declining rapidly, and he's now offering a truly equal split.  This is a good deal, and accepting it minimizes the risk of both of us getting nothing in the end."
