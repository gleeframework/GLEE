"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money, and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is not as attractive as it seems.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite fair, Bob. I'd like a better deal.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's now my turn to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
