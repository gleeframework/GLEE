Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 55/45 split is a fairer reflection of the risk we both face with inflation. I'm willing to share more than a 40/60 split, but I need to secure a larger share for myself to mitigate the potential losses from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
