"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6000, you get $4000. This way we both benefit from dividing the money early. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what I can get if I wait!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fair.  Let's both get $5000!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's not very fair considering the money loses value for both of us. I'll take a little less, $5500, but you need to take a bit more at $4500.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I prefer a 50/50 split,  I'm willing to take a slight loss to avoid further inflation."
