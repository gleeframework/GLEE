"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I figure this is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation in the future rounds if needed.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, the inflation means that my share is already worth 20% less. Accepting this offer will guarantee me at least $6,000.  It's better to take what I can get now than risk getting nothing in the future."
