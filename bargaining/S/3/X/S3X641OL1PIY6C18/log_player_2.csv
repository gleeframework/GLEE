"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I rejected your offer because I believe in fairness. Let's split it evenly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you want fairness, but I came first, so a little more for me is fair 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a slightly larger share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you want a bit more, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is incrementally increasing Bob's share, indicating a potential willingness to negotiate further as the rounds progress. Accepting now might leave potential gains on the table."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's settle this fairly. I'm increasing my offer, but the time pressure is on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but you're being too greedy 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  We are now past the halfway point. While Alice claims Bob is being greedy, she only offered him $100 more. The trend suggests she may be getting nervous and might offer a better deal soon to avoid getting $0."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. I'm standing firm on this offer to be fair to both of us.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  With time running out, repeating the previous offer reinforces a sense of urgency.  Alice is likely to realize that further minimal increases for Bob won't yield a better outcome for her if they run out of rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between our last offers, final compromise 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** While Alice claims a ""final compromise,"" her offer is still tilted in her favor. The urgency of the situation is likely greater for her now, as she's risking losing everything. Holding out for one more round might force her to make a more balanced offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is it. We either split evenly now, or we both get nothing. Don't be greedy!""}
```

**Reasoning:**  With only two rounds left, it's time for a strong ultimatum.  By proposing a perfectly even split, Bob emphasizes the very real risk of getting $0 if they fail to agree. Alice is now faced with the stark choice between a guaranteed $5,000 or a very high chance of getting nothing."
