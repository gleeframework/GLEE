"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, considering the inflation factor!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept the offer, as I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 20% less now compared to the initial amount. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It's getting interesting!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}

I think this is a fair offer, and it's better than the one I made in Round 3. We'll split the remaining amount 50/50, and it's a good compromise."
