"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, but Bob's gain is still worth the same as before. I'll have to decide whether to take the slightly lower amount now or risk waiting for a better offer.

I'll reject this offer and proceed to Round 3.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2. My gain will be worth 20% less than in Round 1. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth significantly less than before, and Bob's gain is still worth the same as before. I'll have to think carefully about this one.

However, considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I should take the offer now, rather than risking further inflation.

I'll accept this offer.
