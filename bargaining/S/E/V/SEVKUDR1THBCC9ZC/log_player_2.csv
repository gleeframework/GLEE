Alice's offer:

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting close, but time is also a factor now. I'm proposing a slightly higher amount for me to reflect the increasing impact of inflation. This ensures we both walk away with a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting greedier, but there's still a lot of time.  While the difference in devaluation is significant, holding out a bit longer puts pressure on her to make a better offer before it becomes too detrimental for both of us."
