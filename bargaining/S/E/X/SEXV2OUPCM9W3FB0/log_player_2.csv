Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You wanted 60-40 in your favor, but I think my initial offer was more reasonable. Considering the inflation, I'll give you a bit less this time. Take it before the money loses more value for you. 
# Bob gain: 390000 
# Alice gain: 610000
