"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I'll take most of the money now, and you can get some too. It's better than nothing! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 100,000$ is a decent sum, it's definitely worth trying to get more, especially since Alice's offer is significantly higher than mine. I'll reject and see what she proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. We both get a good amount, and we don't have to risk losing anything to inflation.""}
