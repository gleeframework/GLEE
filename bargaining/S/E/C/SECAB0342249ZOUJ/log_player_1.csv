"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a relatively balanced offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the money I gain, I need to be more cautious. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'd be getting $5,600 (6000 / 0.95).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm getting $4,000, which is worth 4,000 / 0.9 = $4,444.44 in the first round's value.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself. This way, I'm trying to make up for the loss in value due to inflation."
