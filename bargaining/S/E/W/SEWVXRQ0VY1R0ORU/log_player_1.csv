"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm starting with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is still a fair deal. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, the numbers are now:

* Alice's gain: 450,000 * 0.8 = 360,000$
* Bob's gain: 550,000 * 0.8 = 440,000$

I'm not satisfied with this offer, as it still gives Bob a larger share. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob! No need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm now offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept this fair and equal division."
