I'm going to offer Bob a measly $1.  I'm hoping he'll be so insulted he'll reject the offer, giving me a chance to make a more even offer in the next round.  Of course, I'll still try to get the lion's share since he's not losing anything with each passing round!  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a much fairer offer than what I made in round 1.  I'm not going to be greedy and risk losing all my potential gains!  This is a good deal for me."
