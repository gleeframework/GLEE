"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:**  Alice proposes to take $900,000 and give Bob $100,000. 
* **Reasoning:** Alice is taking a big chunk of the money, but is leaving Bob a small amount.  This is a starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a significant imbalance in the initial round. 

**Important Note:** Alice is aware of the inflation, but doesn't know how it affects Bob.  She's aiming for a good starting position, knowing the value of her share will decrease in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  Alice's share is now worth 20% less than it would have been in Round 1. Accepting Bob's offer would be significantly worse for her than rejecting it.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** Even though Bob took a larger share in this round, the inflation effect on him is less significant than on Alice. This suggests that Alice might be able to secure a better deal for herself in the next round if she rejects this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  Alice knows the inflation is working against her, so she's going to make a more aggressive offer this round. 
* **Seeking a Compromise:** This offer is a compromise between the extreme imbalance in the first round and Bob's proposal in round 2. Alice is likely hoping Bob will see that this is a fairer deal than his previous offer and accept it, as further rounds will only diminish the value of the money for both of them.

**Important Note:** Alice is trying to find a balance between maximizing her gain and preventing Bob from making an even more advantageous offer in the next round."
