Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share, but leaving something for Bob to incentivize him to accept. Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. Although I get less than my initial proposal, the inflation is significant, and accepting this offer secures me a decent amount of money."
