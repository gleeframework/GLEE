Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which means my bargaining position is improving, even with the inflation. I need to hold my ground a little longer to secure a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alright Alice, let's stop this dance. 50/50, take it before inflation eats our profits!""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

I'm offering a 50/50 split this round.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the inflation is hurting both of us. Waiting longer significantly risks getting nothing.
* **Alice's Desperation:** Her offers are getting less favorable for her, suggesting she's feeling the pressure.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair and might be more appealing to Alice than continuing to haggle under time pressure."
