Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. I need to hold out for a better offer, closer to even, even if it means accepting a lower amount due to inflation later.

While not ideal, this offer is better than what Bob offered in Round 4. Accepting now avoids the risk of getting even less due to inflation in subsequent rounds."
