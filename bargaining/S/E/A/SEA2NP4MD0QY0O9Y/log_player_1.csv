"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
```

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer to myself, but I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  I'm confident that I can convince him to take a slightly smaller share in the next round if he rejects this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me, and I'm confident that I can get a better deal in the next round. I'll take advantage of the inflation and make a counteroffer closer to 50/50."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than in the previous round, but I'm still taking advantage of the inflation to ensure I get a fair deal. I'm confident that Bob will accept this offer to avoid risking further inflation."
