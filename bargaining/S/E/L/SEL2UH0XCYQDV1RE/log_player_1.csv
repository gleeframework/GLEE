"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as Alice. This gives me the majority share while still offering Bob a significant amount. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most strategic choice. With inflation, my potential gains in the next round are significantly lower than Bob's. Accepting this 40/60 split secures a considerable sum and avoids the risk of receiving even less in the future."
