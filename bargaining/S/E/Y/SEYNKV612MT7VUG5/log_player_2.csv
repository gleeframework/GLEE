Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm holding firm on this split. It's the most equitable given the circumstances, and I'm willing to risk it all for a fair deal. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate. While her offers are getting closer to a more even split, she's clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation working against her.  I'm willing to bet she'll offer an even better deal in the next round as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's a reasonable split considering the circumstances. Let's close this deal now and avoid walking away with nothing.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  We're entering the endgame now. While I'm pushing for a slight advantage, offering Alice 475,000 is a good deal considering the inflation will further diminish its value for her in subsequent rounds. This offer balances my desire for a larger share with the very real risk of getting nothing if we don't agree soon."
