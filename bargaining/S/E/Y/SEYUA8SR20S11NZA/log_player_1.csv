Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose an equal division of the funds, with both parties receiving $500,000. It ensures fairness and avoids potential inflation concerns. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
