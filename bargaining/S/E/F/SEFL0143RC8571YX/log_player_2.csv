Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. A 50/50 split is the most reasonable option.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a 50/50 split, Bob, but it's more fair if I get a little extra to compensate for the faster inflation on my end. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100
