I'm going to propose a very straightforward split:  $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob.  I'm starting with a big share, but I want to see how Bob reacts to this offer.  It's a good deal for both of us considering the inflation risk.  Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I need to consider the inflation.  While it's an even split, my share is worth 5% less than it was in the first round. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to try a slightly less aggressive offer this time. $7,000 for me and $3,000 for Bob.  It's a better deal for Bob than the previous round, and considering the inflation, it's still a good deal for me. Let's see if this time Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable due to the inflation.  While my share is decreasing, Bob's share is not affected. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway this time, even though inflation is really starting to hit my share.  $6,000 for me and $4,000 for Bob is a more balanced split and hopefully it'll be enough to persuade him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly lopsided in his favor, and the inflation is really starting to hurt. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round. There's still time to negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to propose an even split again, $5000 for me and $5000 for Bob. The inflation is really starting to hurt, and I need to secure a decent share before it's too late. I'm hoping Bob will recognize the rapidly decreasing value of my share and accept a fair deal."
