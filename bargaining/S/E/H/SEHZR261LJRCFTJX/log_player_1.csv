Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a significant amount, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept, as the longer this goes on, the more the inflation will hurt both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'm not thrilled with a 30/70 split, it's better than nothing. I know the inflation is hurting me, and if I reject, I might not get anything in the next round."
