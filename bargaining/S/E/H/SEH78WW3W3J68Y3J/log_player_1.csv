"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""
}

I'm offering a 55-45 split in my favor, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable and fair starting point. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This seems like the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5250,
  ""bob_gain"": 4750,

I'm trying to find a compromise between our previous offers, hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable step towards a mutually acceptable agreement."
