Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 900,000:100,000 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point, and I believe it leaves room for negotiation if Bob chooses to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While I appreciate the increase in my share from the previous round, it is still significantly less than the 900,000 I initially proposed. I'm willing to negotiate further, but a 100,000:900,000 split is not acceptable to me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000} 
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation and Bob's counter-proposal.  This split of 720,000 for me and 280,000 for Bob is a compromise that still leaves a significant portion of the money for me."
