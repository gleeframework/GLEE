"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000, and we can finish the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 3000 / 0.8 = 3750
* Bob gain: 7000 / 0.8 = 8750

I'm not too happy with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather get a better deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, the actual amount is $8,000 (10,000 / 1.2).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Take a slightly bigger share, but I still think this is fair. What do you say?""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, but I'll give you a small share. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is getting out of control! Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, the actual amount is $5,200 (10,000 / 0.5168).

Let's calculate the actual amounts:

* Alice gain: 2000 / 0.5168 ≈ 3874
* Bob gain: 8000 / 0.5168 ≈ 15514 (but that's not possible, so I assume it's a typo and it's actually 8000 / 0.5168 ≈ 1552)

I'm not happy with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd rather get a better deal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less money.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the previous round, the actual amount is $5,200 / 0.5168 ≈ $10,000 (but due to the 20% decrease from the previous round, the actual amount is $8,000 / 0.8 = $10,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
