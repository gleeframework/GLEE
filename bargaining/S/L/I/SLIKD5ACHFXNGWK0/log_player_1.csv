"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then negotiate from there""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm not as eager to split it 50/50. I'd rather aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $55 and Bob gets $45."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more to account for inflation, but I still think 52 is a fair share 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","With the accelerated inflation, the value of money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be more careful with my decisions. Considering the reduced value of money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable now. However, I still want to negotiate a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping he'll be willing to give me a bit more."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, the value of money is decreasing rapidly. I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more to keep up with inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $52 and Bob gets $48. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, as it's closer to his previous offer."
