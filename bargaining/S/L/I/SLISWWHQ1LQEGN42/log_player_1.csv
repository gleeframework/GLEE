"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the middle ground, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation. 

In the first round, I proposed $60, which is 60% of $100. Now, in the second round, I'd need to get 60% of the new total, which is $100 * 0.8 = $80, to keep the same value. So, I'd need to get 60% of $80, which is $48.

Bob's offer is $50, which is 62.5% of the new total. Since this is more than my target, I'll accept his offer.
