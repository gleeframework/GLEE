"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20 dollars to get us going.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80 dollars and Bob gets 20 dollars. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 40 dollars is now worth less than it was in the first round.

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, though. I think I deserve more than 40 dollars. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think 40 is too low. I'll give you 50, but I want 55.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and 40% less than in the second round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 47.5,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 52.5 dollars and Bob gets 47.5 dollars. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger hit, my 52.5 dollars is now worth much less.

I'm not sure if I want to meet Bob halfway, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's split it 50/50. I'm not getting any younger.""
}
```"
