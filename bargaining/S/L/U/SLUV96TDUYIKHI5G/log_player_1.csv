"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $1,000,000 and leaving 20% for Bob. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get some money out of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  It's more equitable than your last offer and gives us both a good share of the money. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $450,000 I would get is now worth 80% of the original amount, which is $360,000. That's still a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's worth accepting a 45% share for me.

I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is too generous, Bob. I'd like to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. It's still a fair deal, and I think I deserve a bit more considering the risks and uncertainties of the game.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will consider my counteroffer and accept it, but I'm prepared to reject it and make another offer if he doesn't."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 64% of its original value now (80% x 80%). I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of the money.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to offer a 64/36 split. It's a fair deal, and I think we can both walk away with a decent amount of money.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
