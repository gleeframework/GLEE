Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're not making this easy, Bob. I'm still willing to give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to give up the majority. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better, it's crucial to remember that time is working against me. However, accepting only 10% of the total when I could potentially secure a much larger share would be a mistake at this stage. I need to show Alice I'm serious about getting a fair deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about getting a fair deal. This offer is still generous to you, but it reflects the time pressure we're both under.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I am increasing my previous offer slightly to show Alice I am willing to negotiate, but also to convey that I am firm in my desire for a more equitable split. It's a gamble, but the declining value of the money for me makes a quick resolution essential."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I'm not giving up much more.  We're running out of time, and I'm not going to let you take advantage of that. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly trying to pressure me by mentioning the diminishing time. However, her offer is still far from acceptable. While 20% is better than 10%, it's a significant loss compared to my target of at least 50%. The risk of getting nothing is growing, but I'm betting Alice will make a more serious offer soon to avoid that outcome herself."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's end this now with a perfectly fair 50/50 split.  Any more stalling and we both lose.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a strong play.  Offering a 50/50 split might seem naive at this point, but it achieves a few things:

* **Highlights fairness:**  It clearly shows Alice that I'm willing to be equitable and not trying to exploit the situation.
* **Adds pressure:**  By emphasizing the ""we both lose"" aspect, I'm reminding her of the very real consequences of inaction.
* **Sets a clear benchmark:**  Future offers from her below 50% will look even more unreasonable. 

It's a calculated risk, but the dwindling time and the need for a decisive move make this a strong tactic."
