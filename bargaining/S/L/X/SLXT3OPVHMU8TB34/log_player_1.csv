Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was quite fair, and I appreciate the sentiment. However, the impact of inflation is already being felt. Let's make this quick and equitable. This offer accounts for the devaluation and ensures we both walk away satisfied. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
