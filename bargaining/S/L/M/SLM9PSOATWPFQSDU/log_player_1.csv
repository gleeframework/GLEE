"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the $1,000,000. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more for my skills 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided offer from Bob!

I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more for my contributions""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which is a bit more favorable to me, but still a significant share for Bob. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I've been patient enough 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

I'll reject his offer from round 4, since I think I can do better than a 30-70 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's time to make a stronger move. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think I've been reasonable so far""
}
```

I'm proposing a 85-15 split, which is a significant increase in my share, but still a relatively small amount for Bob. Let's see if he accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being very greedy, I'm willing to give you a tiny share 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really trying to squeeze me now!

I'll reject his offer from round 6, since a 5-95 split is extremely unfair. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's time to make a final push. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 950000,
  ""bob_gain"": 50000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a tiny share, but I think I've been patient enough""
}
```

I'm proposing a 95-5 split, which is a significant increase in my share, but still a small amount for Bob. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking what I deserve, you're getting a small change 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really trying to take advantage of me now!

I'll reject his offer from round 8, since a 1-999 split is completely unfair. I'm not going to let him get away with taking 99.9% of the money!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","It's time to make a final, strong offer. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to let you take advantage of me, I deserve the majority""
}
```

I'm proposing a 99.9-0.1 split, which is a very strong offer in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finally end this game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking it all, you're getting nothing 
# Alice gain: 0 
# Bob gain: 1000000 
Do you accept this offer?","NO WAY!

I'll reject his offer from round 10, since a 0-100 split is completely unacceptable. I'm not going to let Bob take the entire $1,000,000. This is a ridiculous and unfair offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It looks like we're at an impasse. I'm not sure what to do next. Do I make another offer, or do I just walk away?"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I think I've had enough of Bob's games. I'm going to make a final, last-ditch effort to get a fair deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's just split it 50-50, for the love of all things fair and reasonable""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, just like in round 1. I'm hoping Bob will finally see sense and accept this fair offer."
