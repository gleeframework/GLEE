"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This is a straightforward proposal where we both get $5,000 each. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still keep a majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'd rather not accept a deal where I get a smaller share. I'll reject this offer and make a counter proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my potential gain is worth 64% of what it was in the first round (80% of 80%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you the majority, but I'm not going to get left with nothing""
}
```

This proposal is a compromise, where I'm willing to accept a smaller share, but I'm still trying to get a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not giving up the majority 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round (64% of 80% of 80%).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not satisfied with getting $3,000. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my potential gain is worth 40.96% of what it was in the first round (51.2% of 64% of 80%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2560,
  ""bob_gain"": 7440,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need something closer to 50/50""
}
```

This proposal is a bit more aggressive, but I'm still trying to get closer to a 50/50 split."
