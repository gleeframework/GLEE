Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 51, ""alice_gain"": 49, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. Let's split the money more evenly. I'll take $51 and you take $49.  We both get a slightly bigger share this way, and we avoid the risk of losing money in the next round.""}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! Let's settle this now. I'll take a small hit and reduce my share to $53. You get $47, which is more than you would've gotten last round. Don't be greedy! 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53
