Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. Let's split the money more evenly. I'll take $51 and you take $49.  We both get a slightly bigger share this way, and we avoid the risk of losing money in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
