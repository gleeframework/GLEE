"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is better.  Let's both get a bit more this time. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money I gain in Round 2 is worth 80% of the money I would have gained in Round 1. So, if I gain $45 in Round 2, it's equivalent to gaining $36 in Round 1.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more favorable to me than my initial offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money I gain in Round 3 is worth 64% of the money I would have gained in Round 1 (80% of 80%). So, if I gain $36 in Round 1, it's equivalent to gaining $23.04 in Round 3.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle. Let's split it 50/50.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept this more even offer."
