# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Since the money is worth less in each round, I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. A 60-40 split in Bob's favor is not acceptable to me, especially since I made a similar offer in the previous round and he rejected it. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think 45-55 is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Since the money is worth significantly less in each round, I think it's time to settle for a reasonable deal. A 55-45 split in my favor is a good compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money. I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next rounds.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
