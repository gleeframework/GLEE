"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize.""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the money, and we can avoid any potential conflicts that might arise from an uneven split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair start.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations. However, I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, as it's still slightly unfavorable to me.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a slightly better split. Let's try 55/45.""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will adjust his offer to meet my demands."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 10% less now than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway. Accept and we can finalize.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive with my offer, but still keep it reasonable, considering the decreasing value of the money."
