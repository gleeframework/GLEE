Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you $400,000 and keep $600,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but you have to take it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to accept the offer because I don't want to risk losing more money due to inflation.
