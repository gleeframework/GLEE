Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage in later rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Even with the 10% inflation, getting 5000 is better than risking getting nothing in the next 10 rounds. It's a fair split for both of us, considering the circumstances."
