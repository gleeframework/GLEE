I'm going to try to get a good share early on! I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to take the 50% now than risk getting nothing at all.  I'm not sure if Bob knows about the inflation, but I don't want to risk losing more money!"
