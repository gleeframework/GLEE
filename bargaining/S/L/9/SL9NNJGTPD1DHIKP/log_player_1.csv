Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, and I don't know how it affects Bob, I'll have to think strategically.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll counteroffer: 4500 for me, 5500 for you""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me again, my gain is now worth 40% less than in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, take it or leave it!""
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm getting greedy! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is eating away at my potential gain!

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since I don't know how the inflation affects Bob, I'll have to make a decision based on the numbers.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.
