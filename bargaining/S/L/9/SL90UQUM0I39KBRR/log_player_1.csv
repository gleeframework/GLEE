Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I also need to account for the inflation. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the bigger share. This offer is still fair considering the changing value of the money. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
