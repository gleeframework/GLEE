"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'd like to get more money, considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less in each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation and the previous rejection, I'll make a more aggressive offer this time.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm aiming for a 50-50 split, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
