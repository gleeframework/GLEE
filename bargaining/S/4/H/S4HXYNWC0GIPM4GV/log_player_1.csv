"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not feeling generous 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a decent one. I'll accept it, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
