Let's see if Bob is greedy or reasonable!  I'm hoping to maximize my share early on, but I'm also mindful that inflation could hurt me in later rounds if we don't reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it seems fair on the surface, remember that the money is worth 20% less for me than in the first round. I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially since there are still many rounds left. I believe I can get a better deal if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm offering Bob a 10% share, which is more than he received in the previous round.  This is a compromise that allows me to maintain a large share while still offering Bob a reasonable amount. I believe this proposal might be appealing to him, especially given the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. The inflation is taking a huge toll, and while I'd love to hold out for more, the risk of getting nothing at all is too high.  It's a significant drop from my initial proposal, but at least I'm getting something."
