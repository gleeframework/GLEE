49.0,51.0,I think a 51/49 split is a fairer starting point.  Let's see how we can work together from here.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor.  This takes into account the inflation, but still leaves room for negotiation in future rounds.",Alice,3,
