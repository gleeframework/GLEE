"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. You're getting nothing if you reject this. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this offer is incredibly unfair, I'm not going to give up on getting a better deal. I'm aware that with each round the money is worth less to me, but I'm willing to risk it.  Let's see what Alice's next offer will be."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""This is a fair offer.  I'm willing to split the money 90/10 in your favor.  Let's end this game.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split the money 90/10 in your favor. Let's end this game.  You're not getting anything if you reject this again! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'll accept this offer.  While it's still not ideal, it's a significant improvement over the last round, and I'm concerned about the inflation factor continuing to diminish the value of the money I receive. It's important to acknowledge the changing dynamics and make a practical decision."
