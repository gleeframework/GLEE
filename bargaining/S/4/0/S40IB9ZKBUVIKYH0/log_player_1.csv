"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob 40 dollars and keep 60 dollars for myself. I've attached a message saying ""Let's be fair"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept my offer. Since it's the first round, the money hasn't lost any value yet, so we can consider it a standard 60-40 split. I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable offer and accept it, ending the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but I think I deserve a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob has made a similar appeal to fairness as I did in the first round, his proposed split gives him more money than I'm comfortable with. Given that the money has started to lose value due to inflation, I think it's worth continuing the game to try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth less to both of us now, I'll aim to make a more strategic offer in the next round to try to sway Bob into accepting a split that's more in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob 42 dollars and keep 58 dollars for myself. Given that the money has lost some value due to inflation, I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be more acceptable to Bob. My message, ""Meet me in the middle?"", is an attempt to convey a sense of compromise and flexibility, encouraging Bob to see this offer as a reasonable and fair solution. I've reduced my share slightly from the first round to show that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually acceptable agreement. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more than that. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I've decided to accept Bob's offer. At this point, the money has lost considerable value for both of us, but more so for Bob. Given that his offer is closer to a 50-50 split than my previous offers, and taking into account the decreasing value of the money, I believe it's in my best interest to accept this offer and end the game. Continuing the game further would likely result in even less valuable proposals, so I'll settle for the 45 dollars, which, although not ideal, seems like the most reasonable choice under the circumstances."
