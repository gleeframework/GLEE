"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share of the $1,000,000. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I want the majority of the money. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided offer from Bob.

I'll reject this offer. I'd like to negotiate further to get a fairer share.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I want a significant portion of the money.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still keeping a significant majority of the $1,000,000. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a quarter, but I want the majority of the money to be mine. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you 40% of the money, but I want a decent share too.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a smaller majority, but I'm still getting a significant share of the $1,000,000. What do you think, Bob?"
