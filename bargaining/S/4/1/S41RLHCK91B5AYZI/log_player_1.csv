"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, a fair and equal division of the $100. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me a smaller share, I'll need to consider whether it's worth accepting or waiting for a better deal.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time for me to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation is affecting the value of the money, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I'll need to decide whether to accept this offer or wait for a better deal.
