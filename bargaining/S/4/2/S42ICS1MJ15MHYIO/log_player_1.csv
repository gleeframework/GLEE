"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. I've attached a message that says ""Let's divide fairly"" to convey a sense of cooperation and fairness in my proposal. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair deal, so I'm offering a bit more than I'll take.  Let's close this and avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although he's trying to appear generous by offering me a bit more than he's taking, I believe I can get a better deal, especially considering we're only in the second round. The impact of inflation isn't severe enough yet to justify accepting an offer that's less than what I initially proposed.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince Bob tried to appear generous in his offer, I'll counter with a proposal that seems even more generous but still benefits me. I'll offer $57 for myself and $43 for Bob, which is closer to my original proposal but takes into account the inflation. My message will be ""Meet me in the middle"" to emphasize that I'm trying to find a compromise.
