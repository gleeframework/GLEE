Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the devaluation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 370000 
# Alice gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! I'll have to be careful.

Since the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, and I rejected an offer of 300,000 in the first round, I should be willing to accept an offer of 370,000 in the third round, considering the devaluation.
