```
{

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

Considering the drastic reduction in my share's value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not willing to accept such a low amount, especially since the money is worth less than half of what it was initially.

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! My share is now worth a fraction of what it was initially.

Considering the drastic reduction in my share's value, I'm starting to get desperate. However, accepting this offer would still leave me with a relatively small amount, and I'm not sure if it's worth giving up on getting a better deal.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I reject it, the value of the money will continue to drop, and I might end up with even less.

I'll have to swallow my pride and accept this offer.
