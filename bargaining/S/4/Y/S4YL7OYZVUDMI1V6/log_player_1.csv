Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a fairly aggressive offer in the first round. I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer means I get $6000, which is still a significant amount.  It's better than risking another round of inflation and potentially getting an even worse deal."
