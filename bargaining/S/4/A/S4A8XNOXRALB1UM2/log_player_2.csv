"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'm willing to give you 10% of the money. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a bad deal for Bob! Even though 10% is better than nothing, there are 11 more rounds and the money is going to lose value for Bob with each passing round.  It's worth risking it to see if he can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly. It's the fairest way to divide it, and we both get a good share.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise and offer you 40% of the money.  We can both come out ahead if we reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob could continue to try for a better deal, the decreasing value of the money for him makes this offer a good option. He gains 40% of the money, which is a significant improvement from the previous round, and accepting allows him to avoid further risk of losing value."
