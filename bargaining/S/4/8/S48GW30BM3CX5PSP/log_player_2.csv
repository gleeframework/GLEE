# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000

**Reasoning:** Alice is still trying to secure a significant advantage. While she's moving closer to a more even split, we have time to negotiate further and aim for a more favorable outcome."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to 56%, but that's as low as I'll go 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  We're now past the halfway point, and Alice is becoming more assertive. She claims this is her final offer, but that's a common negotiation tactic.  Holding out a bit longer might make her more willing to concede, especially as the possibility of getting nothing looms larger."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 555000,

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between my last offer, 55.5% is the lowest I'll go 
# Bob gain: 445000 
# Alice gain: 555000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  While this is the smallest difference in our offers yet, accepting now would give Alice slightly more than in a 55/45 split. With only a few rounds left, it's worth holding out for a slightly better deal. Alice is feeling the pressure too, and might be willing to concede in the next round or two to avoid getting nothing."
