"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount to start with, but I'm hoping he'll see it as a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. 50/50 seems like a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

I don't think a 50/50 split is in my favor, considering the initial amount was $10,000. I'd like to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth 40% of its original value now. I'll make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You were too generous last round, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's find a compromise. I'm willing to move closer to your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less than the original amount, I'll have to be careful with my next move.

Bob's compromise is closer to my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. I'll try to get a better deal while the money is still worth something.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, Bob. I need a better deal to make this worth my while.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's get this done. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth only 32.77% of its original value, I'll have to be very careful. Bob's compromise is closer to my previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth only 32.77% of its original value, I'll have to be extremely aggressive in my proposal. I'll try to get as much as I can while the money is still worth something.

  ""message"": ""This is my last offer, Bob. Take it or leave it. I'm not getting any younger, and the money's almost worthless.""
