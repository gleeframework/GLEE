Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I think your offer was a bit unfair. Let's be more equitable. I'm willing to give you $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. This way we both get a fair share, and we avoid the risk of further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000
