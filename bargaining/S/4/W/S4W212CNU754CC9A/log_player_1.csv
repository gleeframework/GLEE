"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0
}

I'm going for a bold move, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting the game!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my money. However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob 60% of the total.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly lower share for myself.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With Bob's offer, I'd be giving up a significant amount of value, considering the inflation.

However, I'm not sure if I can do better at this point, and Bob's offer is a significant improvement over my previous rejection. I'll think carefully...
