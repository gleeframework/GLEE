"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 60% 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 40% of the original amount, especially considering the inflation factor that affects my end. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly larger share to account for inflation""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share than in his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too stingy, I'll take 70% this time 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 70% of the original amount, especially considering the significant inflation factor that affects my end. I'd like to try to negotiate further and find a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I need a bit more to account for inflation""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to take into account the further decrease in value due to inflation, and I'm trying to find a more balanced split that works for both of us."
