Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

I'm offering a split that's more favorable to me, but still leaves Alice with a decent share. Let's see if she accepts."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is better than her last one, but I still think I can get a more favorable split. Let's see if I can push her a bit further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, aiming to meet Alice halfway. Hopefully, this is enough to convince her before the inflation hits us too hard."
