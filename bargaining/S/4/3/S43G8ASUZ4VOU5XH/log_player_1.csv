"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share is now worth 20% less than before, so I'm looking at a gain of 400,000 * 0.8 = 320,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal, as I'm still hoping to get a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in Round 2, so my gain will be worth 20% less than 320,000, which is 256,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly larger share, but not so large that Bob will reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, my gain is worth 48.8% less than the original 500,000, which is approximately 260,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate my gain in this round: 450,000 * 0.8 * 0.857 (to account for the 20% and 5% inflation effects in the first two rounds) = 276,600.

Since Bob's offer is actually better than mine, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take 450,000."
