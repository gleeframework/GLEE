"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly to avoid inflation loss""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with a message encouraging him to accept the offer to avoid losing value due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a slightly better split for me this time. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next round, and I'm not willing to settle for $4,500, which is worth even less due to the 5% inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 3:\n\n```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5700,
  ""bob_gain"": 4300,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more balanced offer""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to give Bob a bit less, taking into account that his share is worth 20% less due to inflation, while mine is only worth 5% less. I'm hoping he'll see this as a more balanced offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The clock is ticking, Alice. This is a reasonable offer to end this before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I think I can still get a better deal. Bob's share is worth almost 50% less than the original amount, so I'm hoping he'll be more willing to compromise in the next round. I'm willing to take the risk to try to get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6200,
  ""bob_gain"": 3800,
  ""message"": ""Time is running out, but I'm still willing to give you a fair share""
}
```

I've increased my share slightly, considering the significant decrease in value of Bob's share due to inflation. However, I'm still offering him a substantial amount, hoping he'll see that it's better to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

Considering the significant impact of inflation on both our shares, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable offer at this point. I've lost 22.62% of the value, but Bob has lost a whopping 67.23%. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least $5,000, which is better than risking further losses in the next rounds. It's time to cut my losses and accept the offer."
