"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple and fair split, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 4000 is a decent starting point, there's potential for more.  I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think we can both do better.  Let's try 65/35.  It's a bit closer to my ideal split, but I'm still willing to negotiate.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing 55/45. It's a significant portion for you, but still keeps things relatively balanced considering the time pressure and inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still aiming for a bigger share, and I think I can do better with my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and inflation is hitting us both hard. I'm sticking with my previous offer of 70/30. It's the best deal I can offer, and I think it's fair considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  This back-and-forth isn't benefiting either of us. I propose a simple 50/50 split. It's the fairest option, especially with the increasing effects of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With inflation continuing to climb, I need to secure some of the money before it's worth even less.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all."
