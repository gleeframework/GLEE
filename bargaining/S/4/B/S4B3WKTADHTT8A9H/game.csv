3500.0,6500.0,"I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think we can both do better.  Let's try 65/35.  It's a bit closer to my ideal split, but I'm still willing to negotiate.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate your counter-offer, Bob, I believe a more balanced agreement is possible.  Let's not be hasty.",Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'm proposing 55/45. It's a significant portion for you, but still keeps things relatively balanced considering the time pressure and inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and inflation is hitting us both hard. I'm sticking with my previous offer of 70/30. It's the best deal I can offer, and I think it's fair considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, I understand the time crunch, but your offer is heavily skewed in your favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but 70/30 is simply not acceptable.",Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic.  This back-and-forth isn't benefiting either of us. I propose a simple 50/50 split. It's the fairest option, especially with the increasing effects of inflation.",Alice,5,
