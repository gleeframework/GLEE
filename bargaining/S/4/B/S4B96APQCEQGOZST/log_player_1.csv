"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $2000, and we can reevaluate in the next round.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  It's the fairest option. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of the original amount, which is $4750.

I don't think splitting it evenly is the fairest option, considering the initial proposal I made. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 95% of the original amount, which is $4750, and it's 5% less than in the previous round. I'll aim to increase my share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm still aiming for a decent chunk.""
