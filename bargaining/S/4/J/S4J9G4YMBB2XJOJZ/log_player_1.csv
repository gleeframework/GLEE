"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 50/50, let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $50 is worth less than $60, and Bob's gain of $50 is worth more than $40.

I'll consider Bob's offer. A 50-50 split seems fair, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting a worse deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim to get a bit more this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 45, but I think I deserve a bit more""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you less, but I think 60/40 is a good split 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation effect is catching up with us!

Considering the significant reduction in the value of the money, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. A 60-40 split is still a significant advantage for Bob, but it's not as bad as it seems at first glance. I'm not sure if I should push for more or accept this offer.
