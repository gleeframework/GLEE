Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, I'm being generous by not taking more. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is using the threat of inflation, but she's not offering a fair deal that accounts for the decreasing value of Bob's potential gains.  While time is running out, accepting a 40/60 split would be heavily in Alice's favor.  Bob needs to show firmness to push for a better deal in the later rounds, even if it means risking a lower outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. This is the fairest deal for both of us considering the circumstances.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and inflation is killing your share. This is a good deal for you, considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting a 38/62 split is the most logical choice at this stage. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing significantly increases if Bob continues to reject Alice's offers. 
* **Severe Inflation:**  The 26.49% inflation already represents a significant loss for Bob.  Waiting longer will only worsen the effect, potentially leading to a deal worse than the current offer. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation factor and seems unwilling to move much from her position. 

It's a tough decision, but accepting now cuts Bob's losses and secures him a reasonable, albeit smaller, share of the money."
