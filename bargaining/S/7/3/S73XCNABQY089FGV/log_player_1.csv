"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

This means I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the new values due to inflation, the offer from Bob is:

Alice gain: 90,000 (10% of 900,000)
Bob gain: 855,000 (95% of 900,000)

I'll accept this offer.
