Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is the last round where I can propose a deal that benefits us both before inflation eats into the value too much.  I'm offering a slight edge, but we both lose if this goes to round 4. 
# Bob gain: 490000 
# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
