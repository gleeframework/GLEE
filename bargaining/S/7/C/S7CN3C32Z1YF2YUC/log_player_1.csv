"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value in getting something rather than nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation and the risk of getting nothing."
