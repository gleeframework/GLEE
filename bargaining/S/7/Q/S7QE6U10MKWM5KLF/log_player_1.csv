"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 70 and you take 30.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the initial amount is $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of rejection. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, and Bob's offer is exactly in the middle, I'll have to be careful. I don't want to give away too much. However, considering the risk of rejection and the fact that Bob is meeting me in the middle, I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
