"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 70/30. This is fair considering the risk and potential loss due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While the offer is tempting, I want to see if I can get a better deal. The inflation rate makes it risky to accept too early on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""I propose we split the money 80/20. I believe this is a fair compromise given the risk of inflation. Let's reach an agreement quickly to maximize our gains.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation and Bob's last offer, I propose a 60/40 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for potential loss of value. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Inflation is a significant factor, and I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""I understand inflation is affecting us both, but I'm still willing to compromise. Let's split the money 70/30. This allows us to secure a significant amount while acknowledging the risk of further devaluation.""}
