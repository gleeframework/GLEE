Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I was hoping for a slightly better split, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll!
