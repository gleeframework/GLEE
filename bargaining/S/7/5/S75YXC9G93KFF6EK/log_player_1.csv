"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as the first mover I want to secure a large portion of the money, knowing that the value will decrease with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. Even though I'm losing 10% of the value of my potential gains, the offer is still significantly worse than the 90/10 split I proposed in the first round. I'm confident that I can still secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to decrease my proposed share to 80%, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept while still maintaining a significant portion of the money. The inflation is starting to bite, so it's crucial to secure an agreement before it becomes too detrimental."
