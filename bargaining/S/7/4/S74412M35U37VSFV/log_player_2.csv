I'm rejecting this offer.  It's too low for me, and I'm hoping for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 
Let's split it fairly, I'll take 60$ and Alice gets 40$.  This is a good starting point for a fair deal."
