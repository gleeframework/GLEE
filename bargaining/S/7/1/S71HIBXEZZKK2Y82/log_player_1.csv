"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Fair and square!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob receives 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to propose my own offer again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""You can't beat this deal!""}

I'm proposing that I receive 70% of the remaining $1,000,000 and Bob receives 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping to get a better deal, the inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly, and 60% of the remaining amount is a decent offer. I think it's better to take this deal and end the game rather than risking further reductions in value."
