"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and leave $40 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain of $40 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $36. I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that leaves me with $36.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer for round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm now offering a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this more equal division."
