Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, considering the inflation is hurting you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but I need to cut my losses.  The value of the money is decreasing too rapidly. Accepting a slightly unfavorable deal is better than risking getting even less next round."
