"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'm fair!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 80% 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I think I'm being taken advantage of. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and 20% is a very low offer. I'll reject this offer and try to make a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50/50 split""}

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with each of us getting 50% of the initial $100, which is $50. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, you can keep 15% 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer again! 15% is a very low offer, and I'm starting to feel like I'm being taken advantage of. With inflation eating away at my potential gains, I need a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but still a significant improvement over the previous offers. I'm hoping that this offer will be more acceptable to Bob, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
