"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. My message to Bob is, ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more,"" suggesting that while I'm taking a larger share, it's still a relatively fair split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's not fair, Alice. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI think Bob's offer to split the money evenly is a fair one. Since we're under time pressure to come to an agreement within 12 rounds or risk losing everything, accepting this offer ensures that I get a substantial amount of money without the risk of ending up with nothing if negotiations were to break down in later rounds. Plus, an even split reflects a perfectly equal division, which aligns with a cooperative and fair approach to the game."
