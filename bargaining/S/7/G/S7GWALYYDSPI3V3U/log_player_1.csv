I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  Since it's the first round, I'm hoping to get most of the money.  Let's see how Bob feels about it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting a lot less than I wanted, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. The money is worth less now because of inflation, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all in a later round."
