"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This is a classic game theory problem. I'm proposing a 9000/1000 split, hoping Bob will accept it. While it's not perfectly fair, it gives Bob something to gain and leaves me with the majority. Let's see what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I initially wanted a larger share, this offer is fair and prevents further inflation.  It's a 50/50 split, which is a reasonable outcome. Accepting ensures we both get something and avoids the risk of further rounds reducing our potential gains."
