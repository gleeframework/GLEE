"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to take 900,000$ and leave 100,000$ for Bob.  I'm hoping this is a good starting point for a fair negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 720000, ""bob_gain"": 280000}
```

I'm still hoping for a fair deal, but I'm willing to lower my initial offer to 720,000$ for me and 280,000$ for Bob.  This reflects the inflation we've seen, and I think it's still a generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a fair deal, and with inflation increasing so rapidly, I can't risk going another round and getting an even smaller share."
