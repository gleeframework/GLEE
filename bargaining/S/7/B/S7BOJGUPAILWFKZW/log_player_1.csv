Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive offer. I want to secure the majority of the money, but I'm also leaving a little room for Bob to negotiate. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, I am willing to accept Bob's offer. Since the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round, I don't want to risk another round and potentially losing even more."
