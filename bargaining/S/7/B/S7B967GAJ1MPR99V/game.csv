60.0,40.0,Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. We have plenty of rounds to work out a better deal if you'd like.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I think we can do better than 60/40. How about we meet closer to the middle?,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,Let's split it evenly this time. We both lose more money the longer we wait.  A fair split seems like the best option.,Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,accept
