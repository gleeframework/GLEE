"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair and reasonable split, Bob.  We can both get a good chunk of this money.  Let's start off on the right foot. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer sounds fair on the surface, it's important to remember that the money is worth less to her with each passing round. By rejecting, I can ensure that I'll have the opportunity to make a counter-offer and potentially get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. It's a fair compromise considering the decreasing value of the money.  Let's end this on a positive note.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's aim for a split closer to 60/40. This will allow us both to get a significant share of the money.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is still proposing a split that heavily favors her.  While her offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation is working against her.  I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  This takes into account the declining value of the money for you, Alice. It's time we reach an agreement.  What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm offering a 55/45 split, which still gives you a decent share.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is closer, but still favors her. The inflation is working in my favor and I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice,  the value of the money is decreasing for both of us. Let's find a fair solution. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  This will give you a significant share, and we can finally move on.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we are both losing money with each round.  Let's be realistic and split this 50/50. We can both walk away with a significant amount, and we can finally end this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer of a 50/50 split is finally becoming more appealing. While the inflation is still working in my favor, there's a risk that we'll both get nothing if we keep rejecting offers. Accepting this means we both walk away with a substantial sum, and I can finally end this negotiation."
