"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a fairer reflection of our respective contributions.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I think a 55-45 split is a bit more favorable to him than I'd like. However, I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll accept this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
