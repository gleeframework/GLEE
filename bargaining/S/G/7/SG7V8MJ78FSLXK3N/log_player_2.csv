While it's tempting to take something, it's very early in the game.  Bob should try to negotiate a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is better than her initial one, it's still not great. Bob should aim for a larger share, especially since there are still several rounds left. There's a good chance Alice will need to offer more to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is fair and the money is losing value rapidly due to inflation.  It's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
