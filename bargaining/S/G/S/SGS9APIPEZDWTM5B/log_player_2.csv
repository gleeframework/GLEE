"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more upfront since the money devalues faster for me. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can split the money more evenly while still accounting for the devaluation.  Let's try this for a fair deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. This offer acknowledges the devaluation but is still fair to both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is slightly better than my last one, and I'm worried about further devaluation. Let's take it."
