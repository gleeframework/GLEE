"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 3:2 split.  Let's try 6:4, which is a more equitable way to share the money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
