"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This means I'm offering to take $70 and leave $30 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer. I'll wait for a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This time, I'm offering a more modest share for myself, but still trying to get a decent amount."
