"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This is a fairly aggressive first offer, but I'm aiming to secure a large portion of the money early on. It's a risky move, but I'm willing to gamble that Bob might accept it to avoid the possibility of getting a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While my initial offer was rejected, I'm aware that the money is losing value with each round. Accepting a 50/50 split is a fair outcome, especially considering the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round."
