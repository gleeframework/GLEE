Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80

```

Explanation: 

At this point, the value of the money for me is so diminished that getting anything is better than nothing. Rejecting this offer means I risk getting $0 in round 7, which would be a worse outcome than accepting Bob's current offer."
