"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to consider the value of the money more carefully.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, the actual value of my gain would be 95% of the original amount. So, in this case, my gain would be 0.95 * 40 = 38.

As for Bob's gain, it's worth 20% less, so his gain would be 80% of the original amount, which is 0.8 * 60 = 48.

Considering these values, I think I'll accept Bob's offer this time.
