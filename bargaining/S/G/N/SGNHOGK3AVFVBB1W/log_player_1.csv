"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the money, but still leaving Bob with a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts I would receive are:

* Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.8 = 360,000
* Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.8 = 440,000

Considering the inflation, I think this offer is a good deal for me. I accept the offer.
