"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll have to consider it carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to be more strategic.

I'll decide to {""decision"": ""reject""} this offer. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more. Let's try again!""}

I'm increasing my proposed gain by $120,000, hoping to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to be generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With the money I gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate.

I'll have to think carefully about Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's not a terrible deal either. I'll decide to {""decision"": ""accept""} this offer. I don't want to risk going into the next round with an even lower value for my gains."
