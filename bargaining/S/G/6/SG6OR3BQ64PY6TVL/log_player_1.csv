"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this time, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the reduced share, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less than before, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that I can negotiate a better deal in future rounds.
