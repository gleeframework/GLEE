"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even split of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finish the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $48 (60 x 0.8) if I accept Bob's offer.

I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal, so I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try again""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting! With the reduced value of money, I'm getting even less than I was hoping for.

However, Bob's offer is a slight improvement from his previous one, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better deal in the next round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
