"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's move forward. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share is worth 20% less, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll decide to reject it. I think I can do better than a 2:3 split.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway and we can end this!""
}
```"
