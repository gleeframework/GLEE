"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a more even split for the first round. 80 for you and 20 for me. This allows for a more balanced distribution throughout the remaining rounds. 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
