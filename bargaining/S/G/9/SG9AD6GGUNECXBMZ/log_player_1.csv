Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,

}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, giving us both $500,000 each."

Round 2

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to be more cautious. Since the offer is not as favorable to me as the previous one, I'll reject it.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is affecting my gain more severely, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my own gain.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet. I think we can find a better split. 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain even more severely, I'll have to be even more cautious. Bob's offer is still not as favorable to me as I'd like, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer.
