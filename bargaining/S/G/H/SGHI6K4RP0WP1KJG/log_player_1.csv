"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  This acknowledges the risk of inflation, but offers me a larger share considering the potential value loss in subsequent rounds.  Let's work together to maximize our gains in the remaining rounds. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
