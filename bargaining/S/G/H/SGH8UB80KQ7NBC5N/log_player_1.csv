"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 45 dollars and keeping 55 dollars for myself, which I think is a relatively fair split. I'm also including a message to Bob, ""Let's be fair,"" to appeal to his sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept the offer or proceed to the next round. Please relay his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value of the money decreases quickly. Let's make a deal where we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I'll have to consider the decreased value when making my decision. With that in mind, I think Bob's offer of 40 dollars for me and 60 dollars for himself is not ideal, but I also don't want the money to lose even more value in the next round.\n\nHowever, considering the relatively small difference in the loss of value between us, I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my response to Bob and let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money is worth even less in this round, I'll try to find a compromise that takes into account the decreasing value. I'll offer Bob a slightly larger share than before, while still trying to get a decent amount for myself.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 48 dollars and keeping 52 dollars for myself, which I think is a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances. My message, ""Meet me in the middle?"", is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of cooperation and find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nPlease relay my offer to Bob and let's see how he responds."
