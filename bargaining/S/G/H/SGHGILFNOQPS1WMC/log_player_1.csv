"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This means I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I still think I can do better.

I reject Bob's offer from round 2.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, my offer from the first round would be worth much less now. Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a good opportunity to split the remaining money fairly.

I accept Bob's offer from round 4.
