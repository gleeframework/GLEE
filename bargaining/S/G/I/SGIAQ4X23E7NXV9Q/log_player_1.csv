"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm starting with a fair and equal split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I should be cautious. My initial instinct is to reject this offer, as I'm getting a smaller share than I did in the first round. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 40-60, and the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to adjust my offer to get a better share. I'll aim for a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to a 45-55 split, but the inflation is working in my favor this time. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth less, I should be more willing to accept this offer.
