Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, I'll take a bit more this time. Last chance before I get even greedier 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

At this point, the inflation is significantly eating into Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob receives something rather than risking getting nothing if the rounds continue."
