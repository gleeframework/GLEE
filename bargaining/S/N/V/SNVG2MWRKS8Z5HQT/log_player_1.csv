"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This way, we both get a significant amount and can avoid the risk of a lower offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 1. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm trying to balance the risk of inflation and the potential for a better offer in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is pushing for a bigger share. Considering the significant inflation hit I've taken, I'll think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not willing to give up that much. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 5, the money is worth 19.13% less than in Round 1. Considering the inflation and Bob's previous offers, I'll make a new offer that tries to balance the risk and potential for a better deal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to avoid further inflation hits and get a fair deal."
