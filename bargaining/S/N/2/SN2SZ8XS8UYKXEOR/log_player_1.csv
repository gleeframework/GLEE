Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I propose a 60/40 split as a more balanced starting point for negotiation.  Let's find a fair agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
