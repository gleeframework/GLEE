"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering future losses.""}\n\nLet's start by offering Bob a deal where I take 60% of the money and Bob takes 40%. Given the rate of inflation, where the money loses 20% of its value for me and 5% for Bob with each passing round, starting with a higher percentage gives room for negotiation while still being mindful of the decreasing value of the money. This initial offer sets the stage for potential adjustments in subsequent rounds, taking into account the differing rates of inflation for both of us. The message to Bob is a straightforward appeal to reason, emphasizing the fairness of the split in light of the conditions affecting the game's progression."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This considers the time-value better. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the adjusted values due to inflation, accepting 45% of the now devalued total does not align with my initial strategy of securing a larger share upfront to offset future losses. With the money losing 20% of its value for me each round, I need to aim for a higher percentage to compensate for this loss. Bob's offer does not sufficiently account for the disparate impact of inflation on our respective gains, making it prudent to reject and proceed to the next round where I can propose a division that better reflects these dynamics."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the impact of inflation, this is a fairer split.""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer slightly, still aiming for a higher percentage to counteract the significant impact of inflation on my gains. By proposing 58% for myself and 42% for Bob, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges Bob's lower rate of inflation while protecting my interests. The message to Bob emphasizes the fairness of this split in light of the differing inflation rates, aiming to persuade him that this offer is more reasonable given the conditions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. This offer accounts for the declining value. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite the increasing pressure from inflation, with my potential gains now worth nearly half of their original value, Bob's offer does not sufficiently compensate for this loss. Accepting 47.5% of the significantly devalued total does not adequately address the disparate impact of inflation on our respective gains. Given the game's progression and the urgency to reach a deal before the money loses all value, I must still prioritize securing a higher percentage to offset these losses, making it necessary to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 560000, ""bob_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""We're running out of time. This is a more balanced offer considering the current state.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to slightly decrease my share from the previous offer, acknowledging the urgency to reach a deal as the value of the money continues to plummet. By offering 56% for myself and 44% for Bob, I'm attempting to meet Bob halfway, considering the cumulative effect of inflation on both our potential gains. The message emphasizes the need for a timely agreement and positions this offer as a balanced solution given the current state of the game, aiming to persuade Bob of the offer's reasonableness and the mutual benefit of accepting it before further devaluation occurs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice.  This is a very fair offer given the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this stage, considering the drastic reduction in value due to inflation—my potential gains are now worth only about a third of their original value—Bob's offer of 49% starts to look more reasonable. The differential impact of inflation on our gains means I'm losing value at a much faster rate than Bob. Given the game's structure and the fact that we're halfway through the rounds with no agreement yet, the pressure to accept a deal increases significantly. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a substantial amount, albeit greatly devalued, rather than risking further losses or potentially ending up with nothing if we fail to agree within the 12 rounds. The slight difference in our shares in Bob's offer is negligible compared to the risk of continuing negotiations and facing further devaluation. Therefore, accepting this offer seems to be the most prudent decision at this point."
