"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. This gives us a good head start. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds. While not ideal, I'm willing to forgo some initial gains for a better outcome in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I understand you want a larger share, so I'm proposing a slightly more balanced split this time.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and the value is shrinking fast. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is getting tight, but I have to believe there's a better outcome possible. Alice is clearly aiming for a larger share, but her offer doesn't reflect the increasing pressure from inflation on my end."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4200,
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""message"": ""Alice, this offer acknowledges your desire for a larger share while considering the impact of inflation on both of us.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal.""}
