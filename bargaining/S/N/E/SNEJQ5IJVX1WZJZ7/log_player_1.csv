"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. This is a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50/50 is a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll consider the offer from Bob's perspective.

In this round, the total amount of money is $9,000 (10,000 - 1,000 due to inflation). Bob is offering me $5,000, which is 55.56% of the remaining amount ($5,000 / $9,000). This is a more generous offer than my original proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
