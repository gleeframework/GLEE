"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. Since inflation is a factor, I want to secure as much of the money as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Even though the offer is still quite lopsided, it's better than getting nothing in the next round. Since Bob is gaining more than me, it's unlikely they will get a better deal in the future rounds."
