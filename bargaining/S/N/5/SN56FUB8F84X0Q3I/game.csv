400000.0,600000.0,"That's not how fair deals work, Alice. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  Take it or leave it - the clock is ticking, and the money is literally evaporating.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is too much. Let's meet in the middle with a 55/45 split. It's a fair offer considering we're both losing money with each round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Okay, Alice. Let's stop wasting time and cut to the chase.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution.  We both walk away with a substantial sum. Deal?",Bob,4,
