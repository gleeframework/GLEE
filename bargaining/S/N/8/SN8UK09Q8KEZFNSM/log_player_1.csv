"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 900,000 dollars for myself and give Bob 100,000 dollars.  Since it's the first round, I'm being generous and giving him a small portion. Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm losing 90% of my potential gain compared to the first round, it's still better than getting nothing at all after 12 rounds.  It's time to accept this offer."
