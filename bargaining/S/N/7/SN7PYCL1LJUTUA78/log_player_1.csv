"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. 

This offer is based on the assumption that Bob doesn't know about the inflation factor. By offering a seemingly generous amount to Bob, I aim to secure the deal in the first round and avoid the risk of inflation reducing my share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

This offer is based on the following assumptions:

* **Bob's Logic:** Bob rejected my previous offer, indicating he might be aware of the inflation factor or simply wants a larger share.
* **Inflation's Impact:**  Even with inflation, this offer still gives me a larger share than Bob's offer in round 2. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  By offering a slightly smaller share to Bob than my initial proposal, I demonstrate flexibility while still retaining a large portion of the money.

I aim to end the negotiation in this round and avoid further inflation-induced losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this offer is significantly less than my initial proposal and even my offer in round 3, the impact of inflation is now substantial. Accepting Bob's offer will secure at least some of the remaining value of the money, whereas rejecting and potentially proceeding to further rounds could result in a significantly smaller share due to the compounding effect of inflation."
