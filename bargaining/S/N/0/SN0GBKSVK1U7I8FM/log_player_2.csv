"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Alice, considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While this offer seems fair, it's better to see if I can get a better deal later. Inflation might hurt Alice more than it hurts me, giving me an edge in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is a more equitable split than the last offer, and still leaves you with a significant share.  Let's end the game and avoid further inflation.""}
