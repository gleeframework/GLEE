"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'm keeping 90% for myself, but I think it's fair given the risk of inflation and the fact that I'm the one making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is clearly unfair and takes advantage of the inflation situation. I'm not going to accept that. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  I need to be aware of inflation, but I also want to avoid a situation where we both get nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the last one, it's still not fair considering how much the money's value has depreciated for me. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and maximizing my gains, considering the significant inflation.  I'm offering Bob a larger share, hoping to make him more agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.  While his offer is the best one yet, the difference in inflation makes it very unfavorable to me. I'm still hoping to secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a larger share again, hoping to reach an agreement.  The inflation is getting serious, and I need to be more flexible to avoid getting nothing.  I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money, but I'm willing to concede some to avoid further losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation is significantly impacting my share, this offer is the closest to a fair split considering how much Bob's share has been affected.  I need to accept this to avoid ending with nothing."
