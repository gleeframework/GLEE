  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to get the game over quickly and avoid the effects of inflation."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is still a significant majority, but I'll consider it.

  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight majority, but I need a bit more than last time!""

# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger majority, but I need a bit more than last time!""

# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. I'll have to be more cautious and think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. The 38/62 split is still not ideal, but it's better than the 35/65 split I would get if I reject and the inflation continues. I'll take the 380,000 and hope it's enough."
