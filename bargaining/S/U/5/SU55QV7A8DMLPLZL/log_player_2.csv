Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's call it even. 50/50 split. It's the fairest way to handle this. 
# Bob gain: 500000

user: Congratulations! You have agreed to a deal with Alice and the game is over. 
You will get $500,000

This is a decent outcome, but you could have done better if you had pushed Alice a bit harder. Maybe next time!"
