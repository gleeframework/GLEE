"Round 1
Alice's offer:

I'm going to reject this offer, Bob. While it's tempting, I know that the money will be worth less in the next round.  I think I can get a better deal if I counter-propose."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. This way, we both get a fair share, and we don't have to worry about inflation eating away at our earnings.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and inflation is hurting your share more than mine. Let's be reasonable and close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject.  While the money is worth less, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I know Alice is trying to pressure me, but I'm confident I can get more than 3500 if I wait a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 40/60, so you get a bit more, but I still get a decent amount. Inflation is still a big factor, so let's not waste more time.""}
