"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split than your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I need to consider that Bob's offer is actually worth 5% less than the $6,000 he would have gotten in the first round.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think this is a fairer split than my initial offer, and I'd like to propose again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to my initial proposal. This way, we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor, with me getting $7,000 and Bob getting $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I need to consider that Bob's offer is actually worth 14.26% less than the $5,000 he would have gotten in the first round, which is approximately $4,326.

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
