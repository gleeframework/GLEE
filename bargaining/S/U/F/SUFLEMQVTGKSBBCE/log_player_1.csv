"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. It's a good starting point, and we can adjust from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair at the beginning of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more for being the one to make the proposal this round 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more for making the proposal this round, huh?

I'll have to consider the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. With a 20% decrease, the money is now worth 80% of its original value.

In this round, the offer is:

* Alice gain: 2000 (now worth 1600)
* Bob gain: 8000 (now worth 6400)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll have to think about the bigger picture. I don't want to give up too much too early. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a reasonable amount for myself, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small consolation prize, but I think I've been generous enough already 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! With a 48.8% decrease, the money is now worth only 51.2% of its original value.

In this round, the offer is:

* Alice gain: 1000 (now worth 512)
* Bob gain: 9000 (now worth 4608)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, especially since Bob thinks he's been generous enough already. I'm not convinced that 512 is a fair consolation prize, considering the value of the money has decreased so much.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to be realistic about the decreasing value of the money. I'll give you a larger share, but I still think I deserve a decent amount. Let's see if we can find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to take into account the significant decrease in the money's value due to inflation and adjust my offer accordingly. I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to hold onto a reasonable amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think I can stomach giving you a tiny bit of money 
# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 9500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money's value is decreasing rapidly due to inflation! With a 67.23% decrease, the money is now worth only 32.77% of its original value.

In this round, the offer is:

* Alice gain: 500 (now worth 163.85)
* Bob gain: 9500 (now worth 3115.50)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate too. The value of the money is decreasing so rapidly that I'm starting to think that taking something is better than nothing. However, 163.85 is a very small consolation prize, and I'm not sure it's worth it.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further, but I'm getting worried that we might not be able to reach a deal before the 12 rounds are up.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1800,
  ""bob_gain"": 8200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting worried that we're running out of time. I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not sure how much more I can give. Let's try to make a deal before it's too late.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous, but I'm also being realistic about the fact that the money's value is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'm hoping that Bob will see that I'm making a genuine effort to compromise and that we can reach a deal before the 12 rounds are up."
