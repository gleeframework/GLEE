Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! I'm feeling generous. Let's split it $55 for me and $45 for you.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
