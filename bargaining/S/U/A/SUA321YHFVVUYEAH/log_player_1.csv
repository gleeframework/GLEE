"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take $6,000 and you can have $4,000. We can always negotiate from here!""
}

Your turn!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share this round, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, I'd rather aim for a higher share.

```
