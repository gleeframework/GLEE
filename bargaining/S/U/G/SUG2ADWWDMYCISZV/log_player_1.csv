"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with a measly dollar.  While I acknowledge this is a bit aggressive, I believe the threat of inflation will incentivize Bob to accept my offer.  After all, even a dollar today might be worth more than a dollar tomorrow!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to take more, accepting this offer is the most logical choice. Even with inflation, a guaranteed 500,000 is better than risking a potentially much lower sum if we continue negotiating."
