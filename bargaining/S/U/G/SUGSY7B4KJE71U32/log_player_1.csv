Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that initial offer was quite harsh! Let's be more realistic. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  This reflects that I'm more disadvantaged by the inflation in this game. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close, but we need to factor in the inflation.  I'm proposing 5800 for me and 4200 for you. This is a fair deal considering the value of the money decreases faster for you with each round.

# Bob gain: 5800
