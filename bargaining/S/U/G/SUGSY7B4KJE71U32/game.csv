9000.0,1000.0,"Let's start fair, Bob. I'll take 90% and leave you 10%.  We can always adjust in the next rounds if you think it's unfair.",Alice,1,

4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, that initial offer was quite harsh! Let's be more realistic. How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  This reflects that I'm more disadvantaged by the inflation in this game.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Okay, Bob.  Let's compromise.  I'll take 5500, and you get 4500.  We're both getting a decent chunk, and we can avoid the risk of further inflation.",Alice,3,

4200.0,5800.0,"Alice, we're getting close, but we need to factor in the inflation.  I'm proposing 5800 for me and 4200 for you. This is a fair deal considering the value of the money decreases faster for you with each round.",Bob,4,
