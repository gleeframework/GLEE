"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start to our negotiations.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, which means I'll get $800,000 and Bob will get $200,000. I'm framing it as a ""fair start"" to the negotiations, hoping to set a tone for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair 50/50 split to start 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's proposal, I'll have to think carefully. A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better.

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60:40 split in my favor, which is a bit more aggressive than before. I'm framing it as a compromise, but I'm not showing my hand too much."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money continues to drop due to inflation.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled with the 40:60 split, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

However, I'm not convinced that Bob is giving me the best deal possible, and I'm not willing to settle for 40% of the reduced value of the money. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal.

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55:45 split in my favor, which is a bit more aggressive than before. I'm framing it as a compromise, but I'm trying to get a better deal for myself."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money continues to drop due to inflation.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not happy with the 30:70 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out, and I need to make a decision.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 7, the money is worth 71.46% of its original value due to inflation. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

I'm proposing a 42:58 split in my favor, which is a bit more aggressive than before. I'm framing it as a compromise, but I'm trying to get a better deal for myself. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in taking a slightly smaller share of the reduced value of the money."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money continues to drop due to inflation.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not happy with the 20:80 split, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out, and I need to make a decision.

However, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer, and the value of the money is dropping rapidly. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering the situation, I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing.
