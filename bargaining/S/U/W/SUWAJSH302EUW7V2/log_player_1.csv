"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, considering I'm getting the majority of the money. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less, I'll want to maximize my share. However, I'm not sure if Bob is trying to lowball me.

I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll make a more aggressive offer this time. Since Bob's offer was 40, and the money is worth 25% less (5% less than the previous round), I'll aim for a higher share.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

Let's see if Bob accepts this time!"
