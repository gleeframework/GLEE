This offer gives me a significant portion of the money (9000$) while still giving Bob a small amount (1000$). It's a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk. I'm curious to see if Bob will accept or counter-propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is trying to turn the tables on me! While my gains are only 5% less, his gains are 10% less than in the previous round. This means he's trying to exploit the inflation to his advantage. I'm not going to let him get away with this.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm still aiming for a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit. My gain is down to 8000, but I'm offering Bob 2000, which is more than what he was offered in the previous round. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to secure a majority of the money. The inflation is hitting hard, so I need to be strategic and secure as much as I can while ensuring the negotiation doesn't completely fall apart."
