"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $6000 and give Bob $4000, with a message suggesting a fair division to start the negotiation. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable. I'm offering a slight increase for you. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI, Alice, reject Bob's offer because I believe that a 45% share is too low for me, considering I started with a more generous offer of 60% for myself. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think I can get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nIn this offer, I, Alice, propose to take $5800 and give Bob $4200, with a message suggesting we compromise and meet halfway between our previous offers. I've decreased my initial proposal by $200 to show willingness to negotiate, while still aiming for a favorable share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI, Alice, accept Bob's offer because splitting the money evenly seems like a fair deal, especially considering the inflation affecting Bob's share. I was initially aiming for a higher share, but given the decreasing value of the money for Bob, I think this is a reasonable compromise. By accepting this offer, we both get $5000, and the game ends with a mutually agreeable outcome."
