"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's adjust! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster inflation on her end. While she's offering a slight increase for me, her own loss is minimized by the rapid devaluation. It's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to push for a more significant shift in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""The inflation is really starting to hurt both of us. I'm proposing a more realistic split to reflect that.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts me more; be fair! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the inflation difference as leverage, but her offer is still not reflective of the rapidly decreasing value of her share.  I need to hold firm and make it clear that I'm aiming for a more equitable split considering the circumstances."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is disappearing quickly.  This is my final offer to try to make a deal. It's the best I can do.""}"
