Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I'll take a bit less than before, but still a fair share.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're feeling the pressure of inflation, but I'm not budging much. This is my compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is acknowledging the pressure, her offer is barely budging.  It's better to hold out and signal I'm willing to risk it all as the rounds progress, hoping she'll make a more substantial move to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll move a bit closer, but don't think I'll go much further. Inflation isn't affecting me, remember? 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is finally moving in the right direction, but her offer is still too far from an equitable split.  With six rounds left, I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal, even if it means risking a smaller share later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""This isn't just about the money anymore, Alice. It's about respect. Accept this offer and let's end this.""}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this stage, a strong message needs to be sent.  By significantly increasing the demand, I'm demonstrating seriousness and willingness to walk away with nothing. The ""respect"" angle is introduced to appeal to her sense of fairness and potentially nudge her towards a more agreeable position.  It's a risky move, but the dwindling rounds necessitate a bold approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Respect is a two-way street, Bob. I'm willing to compromise, but not surrender. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, but with only four rounds remaining and inflation eating away at my potential gains, Alice's offer is starting to look more appealing. While not ideal, it's significantly better than her previous offers and shows she is willing to compromise.  Accepting now guarantees a reasonable share, whereas holding out further risks a worse outcome, potentially even ending up with nothing."
