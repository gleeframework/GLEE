"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide the money in a 60-40 ratio. This way, we both get a significant amount, and I'm willing to settle for a bit more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. Let's split 55/45.  Given the inflation, a deal now is in our best interests.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to make a slightly more generous offer than before. Let's settle on a 58-42 ratio. It's still a bit in my favor, but it's better for both of us to agree now rather than losing more value in the next rounds. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer we wait, the more negotiating power I gain due to the faster rate of her inflation.  I need to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. Let's be practical. 58/42 reflects the increasing pressure from inflation on your end.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm turning the tables, offering Alice the same proportion she offered me, but with the roles reversed.  This highlights the impact inflation is having on her potential gains. It's a strong negotiating tactic to secure a favorable deal before the money shrinks further."
