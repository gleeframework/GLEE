"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 32 ($40 * 0.8)
Bob gain: 48 ($60 * 0.8)

I'm not thrilled about giving up 32, but I'm also not eager to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
