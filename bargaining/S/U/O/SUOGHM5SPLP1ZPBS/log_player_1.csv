Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000

``` 

This is a tough one! While I'd prefer to get a bit more, accepting a 50/50 split makes sense for a few reasons:

* **Inflation:** The longer the game goes on, the less money we both get. 
* **Bob's stance:**  Bob seems insistent on a 50/50 split and might not budge further.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, there's a real chance I could end up with even less in subsequent rounds if Bob plays hardball. 

It's better to secure half the pot now than risk getting nothing later."
