"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority this time""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. I'm being generous and offering Bob a decent share, hoping he'll accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority this time, but we can be fair in the future. Let's make this work. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'm willing to negotiate. Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll make a mental note to try to get a better deal in the next round.
