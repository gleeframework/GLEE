"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer, but I'm keeping the majority of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $70 in this round is actually worth less than my gain of $60 in the previous round. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer.

However, Bob's offer is still a relatively modest one, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

I'll accept this offer.
