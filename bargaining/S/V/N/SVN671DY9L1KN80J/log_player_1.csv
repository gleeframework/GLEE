"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a significant share of the money, but I'm also taking a substantial amount for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive, but I still think it's a reasonable proposal. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
