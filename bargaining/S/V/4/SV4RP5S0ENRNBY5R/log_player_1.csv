  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous today. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""You should've taken my first offer""
}
```

Since Bob's money is worth 20% less with each passing round, I'm decreasing the amount I'm offering him. Let's see what he decides!"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time""
}
```

Since Bob's money is worth even less now (48.8% less than the original amount), I'm decreasing the amount I'm offering him again. The pressure is on!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

# Bob gain: 5000

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.

  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is crushing you""
}
```

At this point, Bob's money is worth a significant 67.23% less than the original amount. I'm taking advantage of this and offering him an even smaller share. The longer we play, the worse it gets for Bob!"
