Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it's clear we both want a larger share. This is my compromise - take it or lose out to inflation! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offers are getting worse for me with each round. Even though he's trying to frame it as a compromise, the inflation heavily favors me in the long run. I need to push for a better deal."
