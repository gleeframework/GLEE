"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap things up quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already hitting me hard!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the 20% less value of the money, but I need to think strategically. With a 20-80 split, I'd be giving up a significant amount of money.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting worried that I'll end up with almost nothing.

Bob's offer is very aggressive, and I'm not sure I want to give in to his demands. However, I also don't want to risk going to Round 12 and getting nothing.

I'll reject this offer, but I'll have to be more careful with my next proposal.
