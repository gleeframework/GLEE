"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose you get 900,000 and Bob gets 100,000. This seems like a fair first offer, giving Bob a small share but setting the stage for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is more even, it's still a significant decrease from my initial proposal.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe there's still room for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 800,000, but I'm still offering Bob a larger share than before. I hope this shows my willingness to compromise while still securing a majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable. I am losing a significant amount due to inflation, and his offer is giving him a majority share, which is unacceptable. I'm hoping he will realize that a fairer division is in his best interest, even if it means accepting a smaller portion."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to 700,000, hoping to reach a compromise with Bob.  This offer still gives me a significant share while offering Bob a more substantial share than his previous offer.  I believe this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unacceptable. The inflation is severely affecting my share, and his offer is giving him a much larger share than is fair. I believe there's still room for a better negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my share again to 600,000, hoping to bridge the gap. I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, but I still believe we can find a fair split.  This offer gives Bob a sizable portion, but still leaves me with the majority."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable. I am losing a significant amount due to inflation, and his offer is becoming extremely lopsided in his favor. While I understand his desire for a larger share, this offer is not fair. I am still hoping we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm making a final attempt at a fair compromise, offering a 50/50 split. This addresses the significant inflation impact and offers a balanced solution for both of us."
