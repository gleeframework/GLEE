"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous 10% of the total amount. I'll get the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $450,000.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
