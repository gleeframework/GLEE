Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but I think I should get the majority since I'm the one making the offer. This way, I can account for the uncertainty of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
