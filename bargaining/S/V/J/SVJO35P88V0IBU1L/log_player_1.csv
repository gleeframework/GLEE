"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to secure most of the money.  I'm aware of the inflation risk, but I'm hoping Bob will be tempted by the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still quite generous for him, but it's not worth it for me to accept it.  I'm still hoping to secure a larger share of the money, and I know that the inflation will hurt Bob more than it hurts me in this round. I'm going to see if I can push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly from the first round, but I'm still aiming for a substantial share. I think Bob will see that this offer is better for him than rejecting it and facing even higher inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is pretty good for me, considering the inflation.  It's significantly less than my initial goal, but I'm not sure I can push for a better deal in the later rounds.  I'll accept and take the money."
