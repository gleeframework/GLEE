"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can have 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, which is a relatively fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  Let's try 60/40 in my favor this time.  If we keep rejecting each other, we'll both end up with less. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with Bob's revised offer, as I'd be getting only 40% of the total amount. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly more aggressive split to compensate for the decrease in value. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split considering the inflation.""}

Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable.  I'll give you 45 this time, but I'm not going any lower.  We're both losing money with every round, so let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 45/55 split, but considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I think it's getting increasingly difficult to negotiate for a better deal. I'll accept Bob's offer this time, hoping that we can finally wrap up the game.
