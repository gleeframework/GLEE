Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: It's my turn now. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is fair considering our different depreciation rates and gives us both a good amount. Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
