40.0,60.0,It's my turn now. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This is fair considering our different depreciation rates and gives us both a good amount. Let's end this quickly!,Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Okay, Bob, let's be realistic. I'm willing to come down a bit, but 60/40 in your favor is just not going to work. How about 55/45?",Alice,3,
