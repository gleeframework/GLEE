"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you $4000, and I'll take $6000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'm not as keen on giving up $2000. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with the 80-20 split. I'd like to propose a 55-45 split. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me at 55-45."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a 45% share, but I need to take the majority. Can you accept this compromise?""
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I'm not giving up yet. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'm not thrilled about giving up $3000, but I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I'll accept this offer. I'm not sure if I can do better, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money devaluing further.""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, hoping that $3000 is better than what I'd get in the next round."
