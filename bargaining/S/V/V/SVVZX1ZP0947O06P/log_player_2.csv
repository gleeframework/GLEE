"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 3:1, a fair start to the game! 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see how Alice will react to my counter-offer!  I'll aim for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice.  A 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable way to start.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You were close, Bob. I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is starting to bite, and I don't want to risk getting nothing.  Let's take this deal and secure some of the money."
