I'm Bob, and I'm going to try and get a better deal!  10 dollars is not a good start. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm offering Alice 10 dollars, and keeping 90 for myself.  It's time to show her who's boss!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much better offer for me. While I'm losing a lot of value due to inflation, getting 40 dollars is better than nothing. I'll accept this offer."
