Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a larger share to account for the increasing inflation. Let's make a deal before we both lose more money.

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting greedier, and I need to hold firm. While the inflation is hitting me harder, accepting this offer would set a bad precedent and likely lead to worse offers in the future. I'm banking on Alice becoming more reasonable as the rounds progress and the risk of getting $0 increases."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  I'm meeting you closer to the middle ground, acknowledging the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's be done with this before we both lose out.""}

**Reasoning:**  The pressure is on. I need to signal that I'm willing to compromise but also hold a firm line to discourage further lowball offers.  This amount still heavily favors Alice, but it's better than risking $0 as we get closer to the deadline."
