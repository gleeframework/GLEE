300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, your offer was quite unbalanced. Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split.  Time is money, and we both lose value with each round. Don't let this opportunity slip away!",Bob,2,

600000.0,400000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is still too unbalanced.  Let's try a 60/40 split.  We're both losing money with each round, so let's find a solution that works for both of us.",Alice,3,

500000.0,500000.0,"I understand we're both losing money, but I'm still not comfortable with a 35/65 split. Let's go for a 50/50 split. It's the fairest option, and it's still a decent outcome for both of us. Let's get this done before we lose even more.",Alice,5,
