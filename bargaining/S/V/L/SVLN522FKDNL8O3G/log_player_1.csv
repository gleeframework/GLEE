"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and balanced split to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before responding.

Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, my gain of $200,000 is actually worth $180,000 (90% of $200,000). This is a significant decrease from the $600,000 I could have gotten in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about the small share, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing values. I'll accept this offer to get some money, even if it's not ideal.
