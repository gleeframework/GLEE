"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem quite fair to me, and I believe we can find a better division. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try to find a middle ground, considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The deal has to be fair to both of us, Bob. I'm being reasonable, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation on both of our gains and the fact that Alice has made a slightly more favorable offer this round, I believe accepting this offer is the best course of action. The difference in our gains is not significant enough to warrant further negotiation, especially since the value of the money will continue to decrease with each subsequent round. Accepting now seems like the most reasonable decision to make."
