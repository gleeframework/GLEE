"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm not going to give away the majority of the money. Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer now. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so I'll get $190,000 (200,000 x 0.95) if I accept this offer. 

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering I could get more in the next round. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a smaller share, but I still think this is a fair deal. Your turn to decide!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the share, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. Let's see if you can accept this one. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 14.26% less than the original amount, so I'll get $343,000 (400,000 x 0.8557) if I accept this offer.

I still think I can do better, considering I rejected a similar offer in the previous round. I'll reject this offer.
