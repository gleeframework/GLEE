Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Let's split it 40-60, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get $40 and Bob gets $60. I think this is a good starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
