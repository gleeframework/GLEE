"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you get 40.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me taking 60 since I'm the one proposing this time. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

In this round, my gain of 40 is worth 90% of the original amount, which is $36. So, the offer is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too generous for you, Bob. I'd like to counter with a new proposal.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and planning to make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I still think 45 is a fair amount for me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, which takes into account the reduced value of money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to have to take a bigger share this time.  With inflation, I need 70 to make it worth my while.  Let's finish this. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, Bob's offer is:

* My gain of 30 is worth 64.2% of the original amount, which is approximately $64.20
* Bob's gain of 70 is worth 52% of the original amount, which is approximately $52

Considering the reduced value of money, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too generous for him. I'd like to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with that large of a difference. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth even less due to inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 40 is a fair amount for me. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable compromise."
