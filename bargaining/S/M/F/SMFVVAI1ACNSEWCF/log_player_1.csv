"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a fair starting point. If Bob accepts, we can end the game and collect our respective amounts. If he rejects, I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting off that easy, Alice. 50/50 is a fairer split. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% decrease in value due to inflation, my proposed gain of 60 in the first round would be worth 54 in the second round, and Bob's proposed gain of 40 would be worth 44.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think a 50/50 split is a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
