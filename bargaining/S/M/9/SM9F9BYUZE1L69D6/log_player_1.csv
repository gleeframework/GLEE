Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. This way, we can both get a fair share of the money before it loses too much value in the following rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
