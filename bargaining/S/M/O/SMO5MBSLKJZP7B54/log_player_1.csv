"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 
 
I propose to take $9000 and Bob gets $1000. This is a pretty standard first offer, as it shows I'm willing to negotiate but still get a good portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not happy with this offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but 4000 is way too low. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob $3000.  This is a compromise from my first offer, showing I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but still get a majority share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split, and we're running out of time."
