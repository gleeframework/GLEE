"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a small share, but I'm willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, so the effective amount I'd get from Bob's offer is $19 (20 x 0.95).

I'm not thrilled about taking such a small share, but I don't want to risk going to the next round either. I'll accept the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
