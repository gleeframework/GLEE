"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get our fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 9,000$ (10,000 * 0.9). Bob's gain is still 6,000$. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I think I'll take it.
