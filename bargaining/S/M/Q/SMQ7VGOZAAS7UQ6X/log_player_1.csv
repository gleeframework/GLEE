"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 40-60 split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. 50-50 seems fair considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable compromise considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
