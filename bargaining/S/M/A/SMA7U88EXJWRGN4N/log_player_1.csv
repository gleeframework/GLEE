"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a relatively generous offer, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're lowballing me, I'm expecting a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the 5% decrease in value due to inflation, my gain of $3,000 is actually worth $2,850 in real terms.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but it's a significant improvement from my initial proposal. I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and Bob's previous proposal.

Since the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, my gain of $3,000 is actually worth $2,850 in real terms. I'll aim to increase my share to make up for the loss.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied. I want more! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard! With 14.26% less value, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth only $3,434 in real terms.

Considering Bob's previous offer and the decreased value of money, I'm not sure if this is the best I can do. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round, as the value of money will continue to decrease.

I'll decide to...
