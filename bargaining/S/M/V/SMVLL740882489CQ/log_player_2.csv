Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to take a bigger share to compensate for the inflation loss. You're losing more than me, so let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Even though the deal is not very favorable, it's better to accept it. With each round, the value of the money is decreasing more for me than for Alice. Continuing the game will only lead to a lower share for me, and it's better to cut my losses at this point."
