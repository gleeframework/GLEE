"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to start with.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, I'll take a bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

* My gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
* Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'm not thrilled about the increased gap, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a bigger share, so I'll take a bit more this time, but still reasonable.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more after your last offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts:

* My gain: 4500 / 0.721 = 6230.73 (27.1% less than the original $10,000)
* Bob's gain: 5500 / 0.8586 = 6402.51 (14.26% less than the original $10,000)

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. Here's my response:

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
