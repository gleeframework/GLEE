Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but it's not quite fair to me. How about we try a 55/45 split? This way we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
