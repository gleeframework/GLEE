"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a generous offer, let's split it 4:1 in my favor. You can try to do better next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the total amount. This way, I'll get the majority of the money, but it's still a decent offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting with a more balanced split.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $320,000. This is a significant decrease from my original offer.

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's a more balanced split than my initial offer. I'll consider it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
