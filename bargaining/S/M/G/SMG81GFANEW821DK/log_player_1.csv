"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount. I hope this will be enough to incentivize him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I would get $100,000, it's worth less now due to inflation.  I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

This offer is a more balanced split than Bob's offer. Even with the inflation, I'm getting a significant portion of the money, and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept a more equitable distribution."
