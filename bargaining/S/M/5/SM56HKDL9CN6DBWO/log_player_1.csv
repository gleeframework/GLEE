"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose an even split of $50 for each of us. This is a fair starting point, and I hope Bob will agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer.  While I understand the effects of inflation, a 60/40 split is too lopsided in his favor. I'm hoping we can reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

Round 4

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  The proposed split is becoming increasingly unfair. While I acknowledge the impact of inflation, a 70/30 split is not a reasonable compromise. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a more equitable agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}
```

I propose a split of 35 for me and 65 for Bob.  While I understand that inflation has eroded the value of my potential gains, I'm still trying to find a way to secure a fair share of the money. This offer represents a significant compromise on my part."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}
```

I propose a split of 30 for me and 70 for Bob. While inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, I am willing to make one final concession in the hope of reaching an agreement before time runs out."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 25, ""bob_gain"": 75}
```

With time running out and the value of my share rapidly diminishing, I propose a final offer of 25 for me and 75 for Bob. This is a significant concession, but I am hoping to secure some portion of the money before it's too late."

Round 12

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While the value of the money has eroded significantly, I refuse to accept such a grossly unfair distribution. It's clear that Bob is exploiting the inflation to maximize his share, and I won't be complicit in that.  I'd rather walk away with nothing than agree to such a lopsided deal."
