Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take almost everything, leaving Bob with just $1. This is a very aggressive strategy, but I'm hoping he'll accept it since it's better than getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it's not ideal to take only 600,000, it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds. The inflation rate makes it risky to keep rejecting offers, especially considering Bob's gain is decreasing at a much faster rate."
