"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70, you can have 30, it's a good start for me 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I think it's too skewed in his favor. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll compromise at 55/45, it's a fair middle ground""}

I'm trying to find a more balanced split this time, and I think 55/45 is a good compromise."
