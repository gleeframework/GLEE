Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to feel like we're just going to run out of time.  Let's try to be a bit more flexible. I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile for me. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is taking advantage of my impatience.  While time is a factor, I still have 7 rounds to negotiate and the value is diminishing rapidly for me with each passing round. I need to signal I'm willing to risk it going down to the wire."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you're right. Let's just split it evenly and end this.""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly aiming for a 60/40 split in her favor. By round 6, the inflation has hit hard enough that accepting a 50/50 split is better than risking getting a worse deal in later rounds.  This signals that I'm willing to compromise, but also that I'm not going to accept a bad deal just because time is running out."
