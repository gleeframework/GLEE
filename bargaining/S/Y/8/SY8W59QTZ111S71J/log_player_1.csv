"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10, a fair start?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a better deal, but not too generous 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll have to be more cautious now that the money is worth less. Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will make an even more generous offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Middle ground, let's meet in the middle""
}

I'm aiming for a more balanced split, hoping Bob will accept and we can wrap up the game."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is heating up!

Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. The money I gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, and Bob's offer is not very generous.

However, I don't want to give up yet, so I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next move, hoping he'll make a more substantial offer."

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The game is getting intense!

Considering the effects of inflation, I'm starting to feel the pinch. Bob's offer seems reasonable, and meeting in the middle is a good compromise. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm hoping this will be the final round and we can wrap up the game."
