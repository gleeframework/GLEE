"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair start. Now it's his turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's my turn to be generous too, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the rejection, Bob!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it as well. His offer is still quite lopsided in his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Time to get serious! Will you take this deal?""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept!"
