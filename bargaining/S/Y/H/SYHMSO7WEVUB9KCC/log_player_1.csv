Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as it gives him something.  However, I'm aware that if he rejects, he gets to make the next offer.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would have preferred to keep more of the money, the inflation is a real threat. A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, considering the decreasing value of the money with each round. It's better to take what I can get now rather than risk getting nothing at all later."
