"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair and reasonable split.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% of the original amount, a reasonable compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. I think 40% is a bit too low for me, and I'd like to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's split it 55:45""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still leaning towards a slightly higher share for myself."
