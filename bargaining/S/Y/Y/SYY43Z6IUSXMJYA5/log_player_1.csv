Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer, considering the money will be worth less in the next round. Let's aim for a 55/45 split, with me taking the larger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
