"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's in my best interest to try to negotiate a better deal. There are still many rounds left and the value of the money will decrease for me if I don't."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
``` 
I'm proposing a more equal split. Since the money will be worth less for me in future rounds, I'm willing to give Alice a slightly larger share this time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, the money is worth significantly less now due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's a more equitable split."
