Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your loss is my gain, literally. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one. Alice is clearly exploiting the situation. However, rejecting this offer means I'm risking getting even less in future rounds. 

Let's analyze:

* **Accepting:** I get $3800, which is significantly less than what I aimed for, but it's still something.
* **Rejecting:** If Alice continues to chip away at my share at this rate, I'll be forced to accept an even worse offer soon.  

It's time to cut my losses.
