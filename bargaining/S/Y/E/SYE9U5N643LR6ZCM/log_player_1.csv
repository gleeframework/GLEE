Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000. Since I know the money will be worth less for Bob with each round, I figure he might be willing to accept this deal to get something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I would prefer to keep more, it's likely that Bob will continue to offer a 50/50 split in the following rounds, and his share will decrease with each round due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least $5000, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
