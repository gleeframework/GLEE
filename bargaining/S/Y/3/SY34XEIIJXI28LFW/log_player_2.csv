**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, which suggests our strategy of holding out for a better deal is working. We're now past the halfway point in the rounds, so increasing the pressure by continuing to reject offers that aren't close to 50/50 is a good strategy."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Let's settle this fairly. I'm offering a slight edge to me, but this ensures we both benefit significantly.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and Alice knows time is running out. 
* **Concession:**  We're conceding slightly from a pure 50/50 split, which might make Alice more receptive.
* **Framing:** By emphasizing fairness and mutual benefit, we might nudge Alice towards accepting a deal that's still in our favor."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're really close now. I'll give you a tiny edge in concession, but this is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob gain: 495000 
# Alice gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

We're in the endgame now.  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure and trying to present this as our best chance. However, she's still aiming for a larger share, even if it's just slightly.  By rejecting this offer, we are maximizing the pressure on her to concede to a near 50/50 split, especially with only 5 rounds remaining."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 505000,
""alice_gain"": 495000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. We both win if we agree now. This is a tiny edge for me, but ensures we both leave with a significant amount. Don't risk it with so few rounds left.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Mirroring:** We're mirroring Alice's previous offer, showing we're willing to negotiate but won't accept less than them.
* **Urgency:** By highlighting the limited remaining rounds, we increase the pressure on Alice to accept a deal.
* **Framing:** We're presenting this as a win-win, emphasizing the practical benefit of securing a deal now. 
* **Calculated Risk:** This offer is a calculated risk. Alice might accept a slight disadvantage to avoid walking away with nothing. It's a gamble, but the potential reward is high."
