"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60$, and you get 40$.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think it's only fair that we split the money evenly. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to budge a little, but I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a 50/50 split, the inflation is starting to bite. Accepting this offer is the best way to secure at least some of the money before it loses even more value."
