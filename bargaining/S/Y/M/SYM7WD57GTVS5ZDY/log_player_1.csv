I propose that Alice receives $990,000 and Bob receives $10,000.  I think this is a fair initial offer, given that the money is worth less for Bob in each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I offer Bob $200,000 and keep $800,000 for myself.  Since Bob rejected my first offer, I am willing to give him more this time, but I still need to keep the majority of the money."
