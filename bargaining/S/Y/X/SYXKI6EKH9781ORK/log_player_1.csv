"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems reasonable for the first round. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have all the fun, Alice. I'll give you a small share. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer is less attractive than it initially seems. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, I'll take a closer look.

I'll reject this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more given the inflation. Your turn, Bob!""
}
```

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob's gains are worth 20% less due to inflation, and I'm offering a slightly more favorable split in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet. You're getting a bit too greedy, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate accelerating, Bob's offer is becoming less attractive. Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth significantly less, I'll consider this offer.

However, I still think I can do better. I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a big concession, Bob. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm pushing for a more favorable split, considering the accelerated inflation is eating away at Bob's potential gains. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer before things get even worse."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's potential gains. Given that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I think I can do better than this offer.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping to squeeze out a better deal, but I'm running out of time (and money) before the value of the remaining amount becomes negligible."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""It's now or never, Bob. I'm taking a big risk, but I think I deserve most of the remaining cash.""
}
```

I'm making a bold move, trying to grab as much value as possible before the inflation renders the remaining amount almost worthless. It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy, but I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

# Bob's message: I'm not giving in yet. I think I can do better than that, even with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm hoping that Bob will realize the value of the remaining amount is dwindling rapidly and will make a more generous offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 9:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a huge risk, Bob. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm making an extremely aggressive move, trying to grab almost all the remaining value. With inflation eating away at Bob's potential gains so rapidly, I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to salvage what's left."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is almost crippling Bob's potential gains now. Given that my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I think I have to accept this offer.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's not the deal I wanted, but I'm not willing to risk losing even more value due to the extreme inflation."
