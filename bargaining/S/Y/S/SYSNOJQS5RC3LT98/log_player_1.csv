"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering my loss to inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and taking $600,000 for myself, considering that with each passing round, the value of the money decreases by 10% for me due to inflation. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand inflation impacts you, but this is a fair split considering it's my turn to propose. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""Considering two rounds of inflation, this is a more balanced offer""
}\n


I'm taking into account that the money is now worth 19% less to me than in the initial round (10% decrease from Round 1 to Round 2 and another 10% decrease from Round 2 to Round 3), so I'm trying to find a middle ground that we can both accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value is decreasing for both of us. This offer represents a compromise considering the time pressure. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is taking its toll, this is likely my last compromise""
}\n


Considering the significant decrease in value for me due to inflation (now 34.39% less than the initial round), I'm making what I believe is a final attempt at finding a mutually acceptable agreement, slightly increasing my share while still offering Bob a substantial amount."
