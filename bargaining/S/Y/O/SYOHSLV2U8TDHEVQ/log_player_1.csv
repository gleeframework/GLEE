"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to give away everything!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a fair share, but I'm not going to give you a free pass! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more careful. Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too even, I'd like to get a bit more, but I'll give you another chance to sweeten the deal!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation affecting my gain, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of, I want a bigger chunk of the remaining cash!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to get left with nothing! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger toll on my gain, I need to be even more cautious. Bob's offer seems like a better deal for me now, but I'm not sure if I should take it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think I'll take this deal, it's not great, but it's better than risking getting even less in the next round.""
}
