I'm taking a risk here, but I figure I'll get the most money with a highly imbalanced offer. Bob might reject this in the hopes of getting more in the next round. But we'll see!"

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6 
# Bob gain: 999994 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm taking this offer!  I know it's a bit less than I was hoping for, but it's better than nothing.  Bob was clearly hoping to get more, but in the end, he had to accept. I've learned that I should have started with a slightly more balanced offer, but it's good to know that I can still get a good result even with a little bit of stubbornness!"
