Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I deserve a bit more. 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for you. Let's settle this now.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me harder, so I need a better deal. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is right that inflation is hitting her harder, she's getting greedy. Accepting this offer would mean I'm losing more value to inflation than I'm gaining in the negotiation. I need to push for a better deal, knowing that time is also working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest considering the circumstances.  Let's end this before inflation eats away any more.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to appear more flexible and understanding of Alice's situation, but I'm holding firm at a 50/50 split. This emphasizes fairness while also being my best chance at a deal considering the rapidly decreasing value and the limited rounds remaining."
