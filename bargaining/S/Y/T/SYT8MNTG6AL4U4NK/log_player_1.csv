"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me a substantial amount, but still leaves Bob with a decent share. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my previous offer would have been less attractive to Bob, so I'm glad he rejected it.

As for Bob's new offer, it's a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
