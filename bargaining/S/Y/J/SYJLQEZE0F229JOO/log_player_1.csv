"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent chunk, but don't expect me to be too generous!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial amount, which is $2,000, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still not giving away too much! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential gains!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. I'd like to wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but don't think I'm getting taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it."
