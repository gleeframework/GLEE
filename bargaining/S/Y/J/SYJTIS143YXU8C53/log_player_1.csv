"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't get away that easily! I'll give you a slightly better deal this time. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I was hoping for a better deal, but I'll take what I can get!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, and we can move on to the next round."
