"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous today, Alice.  Let's flip the script! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! Bob is trying to flip the script, but I'm not buying it.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, and hope that I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation kicking in, the money is worth less and less. Time to make a new offer!

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $1,000,000 and leaving 45% for Bob. Let's see if he'll accept this compromise!"
