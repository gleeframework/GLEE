"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping to get a good deal for myself. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 300,000$ is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 700,000$ is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

```
{

I'm trying to be more aggressive this time, offering Bob a smaller share in the hopes of getting a better deal for myself. Your turn, Bob!"

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 450,000$ is now worth 72.9% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 550,000$ is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round.
