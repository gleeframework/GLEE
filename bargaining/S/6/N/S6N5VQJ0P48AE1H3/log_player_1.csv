"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming for 90% of the money. While I recognize that Bob might not accept it, I want to maximize my potential gain in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my initial proposal, even with the inflation factor.  I'm willing to wait for another round and make a counter offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm lowering my asking price slightly to 80%. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my initial proposal, even with the inflation factor. I'm willing to risk another round and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm dropping my asking price again to 70%. While I'm losing out on some value due to inflation, I believe this is still a reasonable offer, and I'm hoping Bob will see that we're both better off reaching a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my initial proposal, even with the inflation factor. I'm willing to risk another round and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm dropping my asking price to 60% to demonstrate a willingness to compromise. However, with inflation hitting hard, I'm still trying to secure a decent share of the remaining value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my initial proposal, even with the inflation factor. I'm willing to risk another round and see if I can negotiate a better deal.  The clock is ticking, but I'm holding out for a more favorable outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

With only 4 rounds left, I'm willing to compromise and go for a 50/50 split. The inflation has taken a significant toll, and it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  I believe this is a fair outcome considering the circumstances."
