"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, the effective gain I would get from Bob's offer is 4000 * 0.95 = 3800.

I'm not interested in accepting a 60-40 split, especially since I'm losing value due to inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share now, but I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with this split.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more this time, but I still think 70/30 is a fair split. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective gain I would get from Bob's offer, considering the inflation:

Initial value of Alice's gain: $3000
Inflation factor: 1 - 0.1426 = 0.8574
Effective gain: $3000 * 0.8574 = $2571.20

I'm not happy with this offer, as I'd be losing value due to inflation. I'll reject it.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the cumulative effect of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money. I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think this is the minimum I'm willing to accept.""
}
