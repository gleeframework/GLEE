"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better.  Let's split it closer to 50/50. This way, we both get a decent amount and still have time to see how the inflation plays out. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
