"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. This seems fair considering the time pressure and inflation.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better.  Let's split it closer to 50/50. This way, we both get a decent amount and still have time to see how the inflation plays out.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is ticking and inflation is eating our potential gains.  I'll take a slight hit from my previous offer and meet you in the middle.  $55 for me, $45 for you.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
