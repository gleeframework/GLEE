Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and propose a 900k-100k split in my favor. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer.  While the 200,000 offer is tempting, I am confident I can get a better deal in the next round.  Since my money is worth 10% less this round, I need to secure a higher percentage to compensate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to propose a 450k-550k split.  Since my money is worth less, I need to find a middle ground that is both fair and advantageous for me.  Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer.  While the 250,000 is significantly less than what I originally wanted, the inflation has severely devalued my money. At this point, I need to secure some gains before the next round."
