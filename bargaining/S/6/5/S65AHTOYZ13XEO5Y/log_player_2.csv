Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's find some middle ground.  I'll take 60 this time, and you get 40.  This seems more reasonable, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
