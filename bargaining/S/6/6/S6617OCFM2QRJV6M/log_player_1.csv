"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I'll start with a very greedy offer. I want almost all of the money. Since Bob has no idea how the inflation impacts him, he may be more inclined to accept something small to avoid losing even more in the next round. Let's see how it plays out!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not going to accept that offer! I know inflation is working against me, but I'm still worth more than $1.  I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer a more reasonable split this time. While inflation is hurting me, I still want to secure a significant portion of the money. I'll offer Bob 100,000, which is a lot more than he received in his last offer. This should make him think twice about risking further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting! I know inflation is really hitting me hard now, but I can't accept being left with only 100,000.  I believe I can still get a better deal if I continue to negotiate.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to propose a 50/50 split. Inflation is hitting us both hard, and this seems like the fairest solution at this point. We both get something substantial, and we avoid the risk of getting even less in the next round.  Let's see if Bob agrees."
