"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not sure if I'm ready to accept a slightly skewed split, especially since the money is worth less for me due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for me.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48
}

I'm proposing a slightly more skewed split, but still trying to be fair considering the inflation factor."
