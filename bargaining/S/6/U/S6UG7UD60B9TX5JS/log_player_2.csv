"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With the 20% inflation rate for me, I'd rather take a chance on getting a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. It's better for both of us to settle now rather than lose more value in the next rounds.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a better deal for you than last round considering the rapid inflation. Let's close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer is slightly better than the first round, considering the 36% inflation rate for me, I believe I can still get a more favorable deal in the next round. The difference in inflation impact between Alice and me is significant, and I'd like to leverage this disparity to negotiate a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Given the substantial difference in how inflation affects us, I believe this offer is more reasonable. It's in both our interests to finalize the deal now, as further rounds will only continue to devalue our potential gains.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear the inflation is hurting you much more than me. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, with a 59.04% decrease in value, and Alice's indication that this is her final offer, I believe it's in my best interest to accept this deal. The difference in inflation impact has indeed put pressure on my negotiation position, and further rounds would likely only worsen my potential outcomes. Accepting this offer seems to be the most pragmatic decision at this point."
