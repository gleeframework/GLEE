"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and keep 80%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll give you 50% and keep 50% 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of 50$ is now worth 40% less than the original 100$. I'd be better off taking the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
