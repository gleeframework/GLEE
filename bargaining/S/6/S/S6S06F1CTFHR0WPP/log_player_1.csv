"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $1,000,000 in a 3:2 ratio, with you receiving $400,000. I believe this is fair considering the risk and uncertainty of future inflation.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55:45 split.  While I believe this is fairer, I'm willing to concede some of my share to avoid further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
