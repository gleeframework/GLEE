"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm inviting Bob to consider this offer or to make a counter-proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower offer this round, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's see if you'll accept it. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $60 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled with the 40/60 split, but I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
