Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a small share. This is because the money will be worth less for him in the next round, so I want to secure a deal early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, it's clear that Bob won't be accepting an unfair offer anymore. This is a fair split and accepting it avoids further inflation that would make my share even smaller."
