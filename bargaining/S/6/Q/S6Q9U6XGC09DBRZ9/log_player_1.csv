"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll see the sense in accepting this offer, considering the significant decrease in value for him if we proceed to the next round. Fingers crossed!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split.  Let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not happy with Bob's offer of $400,000 for me, which is less than what I initially offered him. Given the relatively low inflation rate for me (5% decrease in value), I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal. Bring it on!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob a slightly lower amount than before, considering the significant decrease in value for him. I'll also try to negotiate a better deal by highlighting the benefits of accepting this offer.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise.  Let's end this game! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer of $450,000 for me. Given the increasing impact of inflation on both our gains, I think it's wise to end the game here. The difference between our offers is relatively small, and I'd rather secure this amount than risk further devaluation in the next round.
