"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you a small portion to get us started.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and leaves Bob with $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. I'm willing to give you a small portion to get things started. Let's split the money fairly, but in my favor. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite generous, but I'm not willing to give up 90% of the remaining money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller portion, but I need more for myself.""
}
```

I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Due to inflation, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round. Since the total amount is still $1,000,000, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a larger share to account for the inflation. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
