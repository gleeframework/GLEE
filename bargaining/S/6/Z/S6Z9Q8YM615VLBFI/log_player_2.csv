"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple offer. I believe this split fairly reflects the fact that the money loses value for both of us over time, but at a faster rate for you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that.  This offer is more fair, taking into account the different inflation rates.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is impacting you more, but your last offer was a bit too far in your favor. This offer is a compromise that hopefully we can both agree on. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
