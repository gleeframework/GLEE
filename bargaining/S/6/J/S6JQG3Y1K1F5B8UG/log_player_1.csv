I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob.  I want to see if he's willing to accept a small share now or risk getting nothing at all. I'll be sure to revise my strategy if he rejects this.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, this is a good deal considering the inflation.  Accepting ensures I get something, and it's likely Bob wouldn't offer this much again.  Let's take the money and run!"
