"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but still a significant one, to see if he'll accept and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  This way, we both get a good share, even with the inflation 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're not offering enough. I'm willing to give you 40% of the total, but I need a bit more myself to compensate for the inflation.""
}
```

This way, I'm trying to take a slightly larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
