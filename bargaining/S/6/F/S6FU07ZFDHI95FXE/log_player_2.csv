"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to see if I can get a better offer. It's only Round 1, and I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value to inflation in hopes of getting more than 40%. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55-45 split. It's a bit more in my favor, but still a relatively fair offer considering we're in the early rounds.""}\n\n###\nI'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth more in the early rounds, so I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer. I'm still leaving room for negotiation, but I want to see how Alice reacts to this proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on your offer from last round. Let's try a 55-45 split, but in my favor this time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not willing to accept an offer that's worse than what I proposed in the previous round. The inflation hasn't had a drastic effect yet, and I'm still hoping to get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a bit more risk, so I'll try a 58-42 split. The money is still worth a decent amount, and I think this is a relatively fair offer considering the circumstances.""}\n\n###\nI'm increasing my offer slightly, trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is still worth something. I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency, as the inflation will start to take a bigger toll in the next rounds. Let's see how Alice reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still hoping for a more balanced split, but I'm willing to compromise slightly. Let's try 52-48 in my favor. We're getting closer to the end, and it's important we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the inflation, I think this offer is reasonable. The money is worth significantly less than in the first round, and I don't want to risk losing even more value. A 52-48 split in Alice's favor is not ideal, but it's better than taking the risk of getting nothing. I'll accept this offer and end the game."
