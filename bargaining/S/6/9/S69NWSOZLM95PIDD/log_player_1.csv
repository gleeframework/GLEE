"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, with me getting 700,000 and Bob getting 300,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is a better starting point. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gains.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the 20% reduction in value, I'm now looking at a gain of $400,000, which is equivalent to $500,000 in the first round. It's not a bad offer, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to settle for this.

I'll reject the offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 40% less than in the first round. My potential gain is now worth 60% of what it was in the first round.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, let's try 48:52""
}
```

I'm proposing a 48:52 split, which is closer to Bob's initial offer, but still a bit more favorable to me. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
