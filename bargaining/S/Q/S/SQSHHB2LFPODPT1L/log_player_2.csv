"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk to start. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with getting only 10% of the total amount. I think I can get a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my decision to Alice and let's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation, this is a good deal for both of us.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice. I'm hoping she'll see the reason in my proposal, considering we both lose if this drags on too long due to inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to compromise further, but this is my final offer.  Think about it carefully, the money keeps shrinking. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI still think I can get a better deal, and Alice's ""final offer"" sounds more like a negotiating tactic than an actual last offer. I'll take my chances with another round, despite the inflation.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know my decision and let's move on to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering we've both lost value due to inflation, I'm willing to settle for a bit less than half, but I still believe this is a fair deal given the circumstances. Let's end this before we lose more value.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice. I hope the pressure of further inflation will prompt her to accept this reasonable offer."
