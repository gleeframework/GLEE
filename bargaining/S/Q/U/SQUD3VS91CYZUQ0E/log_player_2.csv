Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. Let's be realistic. I know the value diminishes for you, so I'm offering a deal where I benefit now, and you still get a good chunk.  ""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  We both lose value as we go on, so a 50/50 split is the most reasonable option. It's better than both of us risking getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, Alice's perception of the value is decreasing faster than mine.  I can still push for a better deal in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, but time is literally money in this game. I'm proposing a compromise - slightly better for me than your offer, but still a significant amount for you before it loses more value.""}
