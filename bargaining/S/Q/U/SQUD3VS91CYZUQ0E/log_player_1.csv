Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Let's be realistic. I know the value diminishes for you, so I'm offering a deal where I benefit now, and you still get a good chunk.   
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Bob.  We both lose value as we go on, so a 50/50 split is the most reasonable option. It's better than both of us risking getting nothing.""}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the sentiment of a 50/50 split, but time is literally money in this game. I'm proposing a compromise - slightly better for me than your offer, but still a significant amount for you before it loses more value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
