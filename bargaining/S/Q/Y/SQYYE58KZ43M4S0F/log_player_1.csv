"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

This is a very aggressive offer, but I'm aiming to secure a large portion of the money early on. Since Bob's money is worth 20% less each round, he might be more inclined to accept a smaller amount than he normally would."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While Bob's offer is significantly more generous than my first offer, the inflation is hitting him harder. This gives me a chance to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to propose a slightly lower offer than my first one, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  Since Bob's money is losing value more quickly, he might be more inclined to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
