Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a very aggressive offer. I want to maximize my share in the first round, hoping Bob will be more willing to negotiate in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject Bob's offer. While it's a significant improvement from the previous round, I believe I can still secure a better deal. I'm willing to take the risk of going to the next round and making my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45} 
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a fair share. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I reject Bob's offer. While I'm aware of the inflation affecting his gains, his offer is still too one-sided. I'm not willing to accept such a small share. I'll continue to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm increasing my proposed share slightly, but still offering a reasonable amount to Bob. The inflation is starting to be a factor, and I want to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I also need to secure a decent amount for myself."
