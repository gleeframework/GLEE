While it's not ideal, accepting this offer is the best option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money I receive is worth significantly less than in the first round due to inflation. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We only have a limited number of rounds, and continuing to reject might lead to getting nothing.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice seems unwilling to negotiate significantly.

Accepting this offer at least guarantees some money, albeit less than ideal."
