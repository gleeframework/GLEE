"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering we both have to agree.  This way we both get a decent amount, and we don't have to worry about the inflation eating away at our earnings. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
