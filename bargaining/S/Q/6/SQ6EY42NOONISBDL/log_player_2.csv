"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take the lion's share, but we'll both get something. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a tough start!  Alice is taking a very large share, and while it's better than nothing, I think I can do better by rejecting and seeing what she offers next round.  The inflation is a big factor, but I'm hoping to get at least a third of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering we both have to agree.  This way we both get a decent amount, and we don't have to worry about the inflation eating away at our earnings.""}
