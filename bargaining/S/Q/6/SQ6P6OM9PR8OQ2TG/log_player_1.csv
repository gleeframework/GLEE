Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. It accounts for the inflation and is fair given the remaining rounds. Let's close the deal and avoid getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48

This is a tough one!  While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 6 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:** The value of the money is decreasing at an alarming rate, especially for Bob. This makes it highly unlikely he'll offer anything significantly better in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk of Getting Nothing:** With each passing round, the risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly. By round 12, the $100 will be practically worthless.
* **Better Than Future Offers:**  Given Bob's previous offers and the rapidly declining value, it's unlikely he'll propose anything better than a 52/48 split in the remaining rounds. 

It's a gamble either way, but accepting now secures Alice a reasonable amount, rather than risking a much smaller gain (or even complete loss) later."
