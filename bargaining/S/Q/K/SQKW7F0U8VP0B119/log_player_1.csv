"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively small portion, to see if he'll accept and we can end the game quickly. My message is a friendly one, hinting that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $60 is now worth 80% of the original $60, which is $48.

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, in real terms, I'm only getting $48, which is still a relatively small portion of the original $100. I'd like to keep negotiating to see if we can reach a better deal for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 64% of the original value (80% of 80% = 64%). So, if I offer $48, it's worth $30.80 in real terms.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 48,
  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $52, which is a slightly more generous offer, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we meet in the middle and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I can do better. Let's see if we can get closer to 50/50 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 51.2% of the original $70 (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%). So, in real terms, I'd be getting $35.84.

I'll consider Bob's offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, in real terms, I'm getting $35.84, which is a relatively fair share, and it's close to the original $70 I was hoping for. I'm willing to accept this deal and end the game."
