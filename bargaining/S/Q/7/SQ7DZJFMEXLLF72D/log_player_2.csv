"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is generous for the first round,  it's important to consider the inflation factor.  Even if I accept this offer, the money I receive will be worth less in future rounds.  It's better to see if I can negotiate a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I think a 40/60 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation factor.  Let's see if we can make this work.""}
