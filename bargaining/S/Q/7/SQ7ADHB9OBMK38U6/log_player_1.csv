"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $10,000, which is $2,000. I'll take the remaining 80%, which is $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $3,800. Bob's gain of $6,000 remains the same.

I'll decide to reject this offer, as I'm not getting a good deal considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 90.25% of its original value (95% * 95%). I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair considering the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly larger share this time, let's finalize the deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,500 is now worth 85.74% of its original value (85.74% = 1 - 0.1426). I'll decide to accept this offer, as it's a slightly better deal than my previous offers, and I'm not sure if I can do better.
