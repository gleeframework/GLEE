}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game early."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You gave me a slight edge last round, now it's my turn to try and balance it out!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."

# Bob's message: I'll try to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I'll think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to make another counteroffer and try to squeeze out a bit more for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now. I'll aim for an even higher share. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, but I think I can live with this split!""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my desire for a higher share with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer and me getting an even worse deal in the next round."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, let's try to find a fair split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I'm surprised Bob is offering a 50/50 split now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think it's a good idea to accept this offer and end the game, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money. A 50/50 split seems like a fair compromise at this point."
