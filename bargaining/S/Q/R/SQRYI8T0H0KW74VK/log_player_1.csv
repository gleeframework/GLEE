"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8,000 is now worth $7,200.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have $6,000, which is worth $5,400 after inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
