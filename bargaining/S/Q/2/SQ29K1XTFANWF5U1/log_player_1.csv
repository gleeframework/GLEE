"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer favors me more, but it's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at your share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI rejected Bob's offer.
