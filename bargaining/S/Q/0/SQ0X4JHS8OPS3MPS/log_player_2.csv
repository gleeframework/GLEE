Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}

I'm going to offer Alice a much smaller share this time, hoping she'll accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing in future rounds."

# Alice gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, but still keeping a majority of the money.  The inflation is starting to hit, and I want to see if she'll cave before it gets too bad for her."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000}

I'm offering Alice a slightly larger share this time, but still keeping the majority for myself. The inflation is getting pretty serious, and I'm hoping she realizes that she might not get anything if we keep going.  Let's see if this offer is more appealing."

# Alice gain: 656100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still heavily in her favor, even with the inflation impact.  I'm going to stick to my strategy and keep rejecting.  The inflation is really starting to bite now, so I'm hoping that she'll have to make me a more reasonable offer soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

The inflation is getting out of control! I'm offering Alice a larger share this time, but still keeping the majority. I need to start making concessions, but I can't afford to give her too much.  Hopefully, she'll recognize the dire situation and take this deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

This is getting serious.  I'm going to offer Alice an even split. The inflation is hitting hard, and I need to be more realistic about the outcome.  I'm hoping this 50/50 offer is attractive enough for her to accept, considering the dwindling value of the money."
