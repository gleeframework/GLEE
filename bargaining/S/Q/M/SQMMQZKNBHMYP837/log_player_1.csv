I'm going for a slightly greedy opening offer.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, this offer is still pretty good.  The inflation is hurting me more than Bob, so it's better to take what I can get."
