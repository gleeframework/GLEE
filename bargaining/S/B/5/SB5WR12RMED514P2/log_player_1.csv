"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not going to take the risk of losing more money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since I want to get a better deal, I'll try to propose a more favorable split for myself. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share.

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was quite skewed towards his favor, I'll try to counter with a more balanced proposal. I'll aim for a higher share, considering the inflation is affecting Bob's gain more significantly.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
