I'm offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to take a 50/50 split now than risk getting nothing at all.  The inflation is too risky to keep playing!"
