I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, hoping to end the game quickly.  I'll see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer. After inflation, my 90% share is worth 81%, and his 10% share is worth 9%.  Accepting a 50/50 split is a much better outcome than potentially getting a worse offer in the next round."
