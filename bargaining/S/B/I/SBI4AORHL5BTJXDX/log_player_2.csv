Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is correct that I'm losing value, but this offer is still unacceptable.  I need to apply more pressure and signal that I'm willing to risk it all for a better deal.  My rejections are hoping she'll crack and offer something better in the next round or two."

Round 6

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're desperate, I'm in control 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting tight! Alice is clearly playing hardball, and my window to negotiate is shrinking fast. I need to make a judgment call:

* **Accept:**  44% is a lot less than I hoped for, and Alice is being obnoxious, but it's better than zero. 
* **Reject:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to risk it all for a better deal, but if I overplay my hand, we both lose.

Given the high stakes and the dwindling rounds,  **{""decision"": ""accept""}**.  

**Reasoning:** While it pains me to reward Alice's aggressive tactics, the risk of getting nothing is too high now. Accepting secures something, which is better than the gamble at this point."
