"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent split, let's get started!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I'm not giving away too much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'd like to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's find a fair split!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, while still keeping a decent amount for myself."
