Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was tempting, but let's be realistic.  I'm proposing a slightly better split for me considering the inflation we're facing. This way we both leave with a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
