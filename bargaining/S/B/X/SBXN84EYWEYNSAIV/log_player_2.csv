"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. 60/40 seems reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While a 60/40 split seems fair on the surface, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Since I'm losing 20% of the value with each round, rejecting and proposing in the next round might be more beneficial."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script this time. I'm offering 60/40, but remember, the money is losing value with each round.  Let's get this done quickly.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and we're both losing money.  This offer is a compromise to end this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money. Accepting this offer ensures some gain for me, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
