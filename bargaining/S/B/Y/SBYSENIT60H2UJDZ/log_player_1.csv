"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering to give myself $600,000 and Bob $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my offer from Round 1 would have been equivalent to $540,000 for me and $360,000 for Bob, which is less than Bob's new offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
