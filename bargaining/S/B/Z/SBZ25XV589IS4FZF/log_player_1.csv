"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping to secure a deal early. I'm taking 90% and leaving 10% for Bob. This will ensure I get a good portion of the money, and hopefully, he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is unacceptable. While he is offering me a substantial sum, it is still significantly less than what I was offered in the first round. It is also important to note that the value of my share is diminishing due to inflation. I am confident that I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly to 70% for me and 30% for Bob. This is still a generous offer, and it's important to get a deal before inflation erodes my share too much. I believe this is a fair and reasonable proposal, considering the circumstances."
