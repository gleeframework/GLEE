I'm increasing my share slightly to compensate for the inflation.  I'm hoping this will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept the offer.  We are getting close to the end of the game and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."

Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. Even though the value of the money is decreasing, I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. I believe I can still negotiate a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This is my final offer. I'm taking a significant risk here, as inflation is hitting hard.  But I'm hoping that Bob will recognize that further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for both of us, and he'll accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer.  Even though the money is worth less, I'm hoping to get a slightly better deal in the next round.  I believe I can still negotiate a more favorable split, even with the significant inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm taking a gamble and increasing my share again. At this point, the money is worth so little that the risk of getting nothing is high.  I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept, since the value of his share is diminishing rapidly with each round.  If he rejects, I'm unsure what will happen in the final round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision.  The money I'm getting is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, and the value of the money has dropped considerably due to inflation.  However, if I reject this offer, there's a strong chance I'll end up with nothing. I'm choosing to accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
