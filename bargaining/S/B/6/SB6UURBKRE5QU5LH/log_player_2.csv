"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a bad deal for Bob. While it's tempting to take something, there are many more rounds and Bob can likely get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's still not ideal, this offer is much better than the first round and it's unclear what Alice's next offer might be. It's safer to take a decent offer than risk getting nothing."
