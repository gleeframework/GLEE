"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 70/30 in favor of Alice. This seems fair considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 300,000 is a decent amount,  I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially knowing that the money will be worth less in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think a 55/45 split is a more balanced approach, considering the risk of inflation. I'm willing to take a larger share to incentivize a quick agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation rate, I propose a 60/40 split. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the decreasing value of money over time. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer ensures I receive a significant amount of money. Considering the inflation rate and the risk of receiving nothing if the game continues, accepting a 40% share is the most practical choice."
