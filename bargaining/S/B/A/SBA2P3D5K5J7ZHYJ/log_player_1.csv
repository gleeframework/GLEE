"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fair offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'd rather have a smaller share now than risk waiting for a better offer. I'll accept.
