"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I'm also smart. Take this or risk getting nothing at all in the next round! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's too risky to accept so early in the game.  There's a good chance I can get a better deal if I push for more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start, and we both get a good chunk of the money.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a little, but I still need a larger share to make it worthwhile. Accept this, and we can end this game. Reject it, and the risk of getting nothing increases for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice is offering a bit more than her previous proposal, it's still not fair.  I'm still willing to gamble on a better deal in the next round.  The risk of getting nothing increases, but the potential reward is worth it."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need a larger portion to make this worth it for me. Let's find a middle ground before we both risk getting nothing.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go any lower. Accept it, or we both risk getting nothing in the end. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still not ideal, but it's a lot better than getting nothing at all.  The risk of getting nothing is getting higher with each round, and it's time to lock in something. I'll accept her offer."
