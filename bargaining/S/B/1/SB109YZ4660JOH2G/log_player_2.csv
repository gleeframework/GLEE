"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","## Step 1: Evaluate the fairness of the offer.
Alice has proposed a division where she takes 60% of the money and I take 40%. Considering it's the first round and there's no pressure from inflation yet, this offer doesn't seem particularly generous.

## Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation on future offers.
Since the value of the money decreases by 10% with each round, it's crucial to end the game as soon as possible to maximize the real value of the gain. However, accepting a significantly uneven split in the first round might not be the best strategy.

## Step 3: Determine a strategy for the current round.
Given the above considerations, the initial offer doesn't seem enticing enough to accept immediately, especially since we're just starting and there's room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer in the next round might yield a better result.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","## Step 1: Calculate the adjusted value of the money after the first round.
Given that the value of the money decreases by 10% with each round, after the first round, the $10,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $9,000.

## Step 2: Determine a fair division considering the adjusted value.
Aiming for a more equitable split than Alice's initial offer, and taking into account the reduced value of the money, proposing a 50/50 split of the original $10,000 seems reasonable. However, since we're now dealing with a devalued amount, the offer should reflect the current value.

## Step 3: Formulate the offer and message to Alice.
Offer Alice a 50% split of the adjusted value, but since we're negotiating based on the original $10,000 for simplicity, the offer remains as a 50/50 split of $10,000, but the reasoning is based on the devalued amount. Attach a message explaining the rationale behind this offer.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Considering the money's devaluation, a 50/50 split is more than fair. Let's settle on this before the value drops further.""}"
