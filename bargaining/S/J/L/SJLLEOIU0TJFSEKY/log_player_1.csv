Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fair offer to start. I'm taking the majority share, but leaving a small amount for Bob, hoping to incentivize him to accept.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept this offer. The money is worth less now due to inflation, but I can still get a better deal.  I'll counter with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more balanced, aiming for a closer split.  I'm willing to give up some of my share, but I still want to ensure a decent amount for myself. Hopefully, this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
