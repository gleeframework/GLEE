  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself, which is a 60-40 split."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{

I don't want to give up 70% of the remaining money. I'd like to propose a counteroffer."
