"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking. In terms of the original 100 dollars, Bob's offer is actually 45% for me and 55% for him.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
