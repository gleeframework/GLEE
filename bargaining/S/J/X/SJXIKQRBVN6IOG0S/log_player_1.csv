"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you $4000 and take $6000 for myself.""
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly higher share, but still a fair split considering we're starting from scratch."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  How about we flip it this time? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to flip the script, eh?

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd rather have a higher share now to compensate for the loss in value. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $4000 and hope that in future rounds, I can negotiate a better deal."
