"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I think we can both do better in the future rounds 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer is tempting, it's worth rejecting and seeing if she'll be more generous in the future rounds. Remember, the money is worth less to her in each round, so she has more pressure to make a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the diminishing value of the money. Let's end this game and both get a decent amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we can both do better with a more even split. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This offer is a significant improvement for Bob, considering the decreasing value of money. While Alice gets more, it's a reasonable compromise that avoids further rounds of potentially worse outcomes."
