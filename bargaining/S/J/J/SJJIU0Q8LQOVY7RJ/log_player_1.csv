"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can take 40%""
}
```

This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll offer a 50/50 split. Let's meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In the first round, I would have gained $6000. With 5% inflation, that's equivalent to $5700 in the second round.

Bob's offer of a 50/50 split would put me at $5000, which is less than the equivalent of my original offer. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll make a new offer: I'll take 55% and you can take 45%""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money I gain is worth another 5% less due to inflation, so the equivalent value of my gain in the first round is now $5445.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 55% again, but this time it's a bit more aggressive. What do you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll offer a bit more to you, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the fourth round, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, which is equivalent to $5263.60 in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $4000, which is even lower than my previous offer. I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer.

However, I also need to consider the fact that Bob is offering a more significant share to himself, which might be a strategic move to put pressure on me.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I'll make a new offer: I'll take 52.5% and you can take 47.5%""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the fifth round, the money I gain is worth another 5% less due to inflation, so the equivalent value of my gain in the first round is now $5033.68.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is as low as I can go 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the sixth round, the money I gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, which is equivalent to $4693.44 in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $3000, which is significantly lower than my previous offers. I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, especially since Bob is taking a larger share. However, I also don't want to risk going to the next round, where the money I gain will be worth even less.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm willing to give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the eighth round, the money I gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round, which is equivalent to $4183.88 in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I would gain $2000, which is a very low amount. I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation and the decreasing value of the money.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, especially since Bob is taking a very large share. However, I also don't want to risk going to the next round, where the money I gain will be worth even less.

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In the ninth round, the money I gain is worth another 5% less due to inflation, so the equivalent value of my gain in the first round is now $3978.41.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreasing value of the money.

However, I've also realized that I'm getting close to the point where I'll be accepting a very small share of the money. Considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, I'll make a more aggressive offer.
