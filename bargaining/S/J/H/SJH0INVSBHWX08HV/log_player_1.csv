"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but still a significant one, to see if he'll accept and end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm looking for a better deal 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my initial offer would have been less attractive to Bob, so I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 75-25 split, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

This offer is a bit more generous than my initial one, but still not as generous as Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will accept this compromise and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really eating into the value of the money! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my previous offers don't seem as attractive as they did before.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of 4500 for me and 5500 for him. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking getting a worse deal due to the decreasing value of the money."
