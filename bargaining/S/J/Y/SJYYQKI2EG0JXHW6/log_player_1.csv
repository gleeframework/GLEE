# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly this time. We can both benefit more if we come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 50

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince you've already provided my response for Round 3, I'll just reiterate it:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed with Bob's response.\n\n###\n\n(Note: Keep in mind that the values are actually worth less due to the 5% inflation per round, but we'll keep using the original $100 as the base value for simplicity.)\n\n###\n\nWaiting for Bob's response..."
