"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}

This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm giving Bob a significant portion of the money upfront. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive than I expected, but I'll consider it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me less than I initially offered him. I'll make my next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 640000,
  ""bob_gain"": 360000
}

This offer is a bit more favorable to me, but still gives Bob a significant share. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round!

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me such a small share. I'll make my next offer.

(By the way, I'm starting to get a bit worried that we might not reach a deal before the 12 rounds are up!)"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is getting scarcer!

{
  ""alice_gain"": 512000,
  ""bob_gain"": 488000
}

This offer is a bit more balanced, but I'm still trying to get a decent share. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
