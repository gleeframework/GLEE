Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair resolution. Consider the declining value and let's settle this round. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm not sure if this is the best deal, but I'm worried about inflation eating away at my potential gains."
