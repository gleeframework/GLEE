"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split.  I'll take 60%, you take 40%.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn.\n\n###\n\nThanks!\n\n###\n\nBest, Bob\n\n###\n\nCan I make my proposal now? I'd like to propose: 55% for me, 45% for Alice.\n\n###\n\nThanks!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision.\n\n###\n\nThanks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable - a 50/50 split is the fairest option now. Inflation is hurting us both, so let's agree and move on. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI think a 50/50 split is a good compromise, considering the inflation. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risking further loss of value.\n\n###\n\nLet's finalize the agreement!"
