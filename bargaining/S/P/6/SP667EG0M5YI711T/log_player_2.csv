Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to look out for my own interests too. This offer is a compromise, and I suggest you take it before inflation eats away at your potential gains even more.

# Alice gain: 5400

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I'm holding firm. Accepting a deal where I consistently get less than 50% is a losing strategy in the long run, even with the inflation disparity. My offer in Round 4 was strategically designed to be my ""final offer"" above 50%.  By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling to Alice that I'm willing to play hardball, which might make her more open to a better offer in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. The clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm offering a perfectly even split.  Take it or leave it -  I won't be offering this again.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point, and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. It's time to apply more pressure.
* **Straightforward Split:** A 50/50 split is the simplest and arguably fairest solution. It removes the need for complex calculations and eliminates any potential arguments about fairness. 
* **Ultimatum:** By stating that this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and forcing Alice to make a decision.  She knows that if she rejects this, future offers from me are likely to be less favorable to her."
