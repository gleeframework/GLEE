"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This is my initial offer, aiming for a fair split while keeping in mind the inflation. I'm giving Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to incentivize him to accept quickly and avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a more equal split, the inflation makes it increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me at least something, even though it's less than my initial proposal."
