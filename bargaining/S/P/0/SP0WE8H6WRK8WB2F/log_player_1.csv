"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. This is a relatively fair offer, considering that the money is worth less to Bob in each subsequent round. The message ""Let's be fair"" is a polite way to initiate the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the inflation will affect me more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although Bob is trying to make a more fair split considering the inflation, I still have the upper hand in this negotiation. Since the money is worth the same to me in each round, I can afford to hold out for a better offer. Additionally, Bob's gain is worth 20% less in this round, which means the actual value of his proposed gain is lower than it appears. I'll try to take advantage of this and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob 45% of the money and keep 55% for myself. This is a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, taking into account the fact that Bob's gain is worth less due to inflation. The message ""Considering the inflation, this is a generous offer"" is a way to frame my proposal as a compromise, while still trying to maintain an advantage in the negotiation. Since Bob's gain is worth even less in this round, I'm hoping he'll be more willing to accept a slightly less favorable split."
