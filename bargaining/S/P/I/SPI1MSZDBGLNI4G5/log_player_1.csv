"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 900,000 dollars and give Bob 100,000 dollars.  I'm aiming for a good starting point that still favors me, as I'm the one making the proposal.  Let's see if Bob takes it or wants to make a counter offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is fair and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round. With inflation, the money is worth less, so it's best to take what I can get now."
