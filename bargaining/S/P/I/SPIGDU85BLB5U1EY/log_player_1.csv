"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try low 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, my effective gains are now:

* My gain: 630,000 (70% of 900,000, which is 10% less than 1,000,000)
* Bob's gain: 240,000 (30% of 800,000, which is 20% less than 1,000,000)

Considering Bob's offer, I see that he's proposing a 80-20 split, which is even more skewed towards him. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.
