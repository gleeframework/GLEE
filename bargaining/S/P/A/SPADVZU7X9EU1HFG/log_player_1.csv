"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the effects of inflation.

Since my gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll get 600000 * 0.8 = 480000.
Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, but I don't know the exact amount he gains, so I'll assume it's 600000 * 0.95 = 570000.

I'll reject this offer since I'd rather get a higher amount after inflation.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer.
