Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and it's losing value fast.  I'm being reasonable, let's close this deal now. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice is chipping away at my potential gains, but I'm willing to gamble another round.  The inflation hurts me more, but she also seems eager to end the game.
