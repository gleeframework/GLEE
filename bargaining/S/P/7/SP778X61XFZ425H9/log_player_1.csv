"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

This is a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a very uneven split. I'd rather not accept it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's previous offer was skewed heavily in his favor, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal this time. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This way, I'm offering a slightly higher share, but still keeping it relatively balanced."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting more and more skewed towards him. I'll reject this offer as well. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, since Bob's offers are getting more and more one-sided. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

This way, I'm taking a larger share, but I'm still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is extremely one-sided in Bob's favor. I'm not willing to accept such a low share. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more extreme offer this time, since Bob's offers are getting more and more outrageous. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 999000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}

This way, I'm taking a huge share, but I'm leaving Bob with a tiny amount. It's a bit of a risk, but I'm hoping Bob will realize that he needs to make a more reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is even more extreme than before, with Bob trying to take a massive share of the money. I'm not going to accept this offer. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make an offer that's more extreme in the opposite direction. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 1,
  ""bob_gain"": 999999
}

This way, I'm taking a tiny share, but I'm leaving Bob with almost all the money. It's a long shot, but I'm hoping he'll realize that he needs to make a more reasonable offer."
