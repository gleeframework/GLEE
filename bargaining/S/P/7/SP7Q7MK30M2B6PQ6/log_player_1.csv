"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the risk""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, and I'm framing it as taking on the risk, implying that I'm willing to take on more of the uncertainty and Bob can just take a smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's split it fair 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in Round 2, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 50 x 0.9 = 45
* Bob gain: 50 x 0.9 = 45

I accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
