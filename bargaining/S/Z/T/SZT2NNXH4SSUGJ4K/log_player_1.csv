"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take 80% 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than that. His offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not willing to give up 80% of the money. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, let's split it 55-45""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to the 60-40 split I initially proposed, but still gives Bob a significant share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 90%, you can have 10% 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more and more aggressive!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. 10% is way too low for me, and I'm not willing to give up 90% of the money. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to keep a decent share""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a larger share and keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take almost all, you can have a small share 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting really lopsided!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. $50,000 is a tiny fraction of the original $1,000,000, and I'm not willing to accept such a paltry sum. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for a more reasonable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slight majority, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that gives Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeps me with a significant portion of the money."
