"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is my first offer. I'm aiming for a large share, but I'm willing to give Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept. I'm aware of the inflation risk, but I'm hoping he'll be tempted by the immediate gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to a 50/50 split, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I believe I can still get a better deal, especially since the inflation is affecting him more than me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, but I'm still aiming for the majority of the money.  I'm hoping that the inflation will make him more willing to accept a deal that's less favorable for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, it's still not fair considering the inflation affecting him more than me. I'm confident I can secure a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm sticking with a similar offer to round 3, hoping that the increasing inflation will make Bob more amenable to accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, and the inflation is hitting him hard. While I'd prefer a larger share, it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers. I'll accept this one and secure some of the money before it's completely devalued."
