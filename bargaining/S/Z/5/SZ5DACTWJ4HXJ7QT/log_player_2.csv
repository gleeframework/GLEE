"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take a bit more, but we both get a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% inflation penalty isn't too bad, and I think I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor this time.""}\n\nSince the money is now worth 5% less, the effective total is $9,500. I'm offering Alice $4,275 (4500 * 0.95) and I'll take $5,225 (5500 * 0.95). I think this is a reasonable counteroffer, considering the inflation penalty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is the fairest split, considering the inflation. Let's agree on this and end the game. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the inflation, the effective total is now $9,025 (10,000 * 0.9025). Alice's offer of $5,000 for me and $5,000 for her seems fair at this point, as we'd both get $4,512.5 (5000 * 0.9025). I don't think I can get a better deal in the next round, so I'll accept this offer."
