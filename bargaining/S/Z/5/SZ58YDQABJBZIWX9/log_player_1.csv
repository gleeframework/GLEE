"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm giving Bob a third of the total amount. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is affecting me more than Bob, it seems!

I'll think carefully about this offer... After considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the continued inflation. Since my potential gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is really taking its toll on me now! My potential gain is worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

After considering the offer, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the offer, as it seems like the best option given the current circumstances."
