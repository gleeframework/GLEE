"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large share, but I'm aware that the money will be worth less in the future.  I'm hoping to secure a good deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better for me in terms of the money I receive, it's still not ideal considering how much the money is devaluing each round.  I believe I can get a better deal by proposing in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my proposed share to 800,000, but still leaving Bob with a significant portion. I'm hoping this will entice him to accept before we both lose more money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly less than what I originally sought, it's still a good deal considering the rapid devaluation of the money.  I can't afford to risk losing even more value by rejecting and proposing again."
