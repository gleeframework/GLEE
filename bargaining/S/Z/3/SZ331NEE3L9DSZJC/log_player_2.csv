**Reasoning:**

While Alice is correct that time is running out, her offers are getting marginally better, but still heavily favor her.  It's likely she's trying to pressure me with the inflation factor. I need to show I'm willing to risk it going to later rounds to get a better deal.  There's still a chance she'll break and offer a more even split."
