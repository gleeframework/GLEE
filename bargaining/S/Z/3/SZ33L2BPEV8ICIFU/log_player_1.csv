"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get a decent chunk of the money, and Bob still gets a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think carefully...

I'll reject the offer for now. I'm not willing to give up 80% of the money, even if it's worth less for Bob due to inflation.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced one this time. I'll aim for a higher share, but not as extreme as Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```"

Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is even more extreme than before! With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth significantly less due to inflation, I think I can do better than this.

I'll reject the offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Bob's offers have been getting more and more extreme, so I'll try to make a more moderate offer this time. I'll aim for a higher share, but not as extreme as Bob's offers.

  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting ridiculous! Bob's offer is now extremely lopsided, and the money he gains is worth a tiny fraction of what it was in the first round. I'm not going to accept this.

```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I think Bob's offers have been getting more and more extreme, and I'm starting to think he's trying to drive the negotiations to a point where I'll accept any offer just to get something. I'll try to make a more moderate offer again, but this time with a bit more emphasis on fairness.
