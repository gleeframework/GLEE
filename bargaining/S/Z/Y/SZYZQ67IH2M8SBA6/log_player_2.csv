"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While a 60-40 split seems fair in a vacuum, Bob has the advantage of time in this scenario. As the rounds progress and inflation kicks in, the value of the money decreases. If Bob waits, he can likely negotiate a better split in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer Alice, but I'm aiming for a slightly better split. How about we go 55-45?""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking the Lead:**  Bob needs to establish his position and aim for a more advantageous split. 
* **Reasonable Starting Point:** A 55-45 split is a strong opening move without being overly aggressive. It gives Alice room to negotiate down while still securing a decent share for Bob.
* **Time Factor:**  While the first round's inflation is relatively minor, it sets the stage for future rounds. Delaying allows Bob to leverage the increasing pressure of the shrinking pot."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do 58-42, it's as low as I'm willing to go! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is starting to feel the pressure of inflation. While her offer is slightly better, it's still tilted in her favor. Bob can afford to hold out a bit longer and see if she'll budge further.  The potential loss from inflation is still outweighed by the potential gain from a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Time is ticking, Alice.  I'm coming down a bit to 52-48. Let's close this deal and avoid losing more to inflation.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Bob shows willingness to negotiate by lowering his demand slightly from 55% to 52%. 
* **Highlighting the Time Pressure:** Reminding Alice about the shrinking pot due to inflation adds urgency and might make her more agreeable.
* **Aiming for a Favorable Split:** The 52-48 split, while not ideal, secures a slight advantage for Bob, reflecting his stronger position due to time."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between my last offer and yours. 57-43, take it or leave it! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The game has reached a critical point:

* **Inflation Pressure:** The 34.39% inflation represents a significant loss. Further rounds will only exacerbate this, eroding potential gains.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Her offer, while not ideal, is a compromise.  Her ""take it or leave it"" tone suggests she's unlikely to budge further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better split in later rounds carries a substantial risk. The potential loss from inflation outweighs the potential gain at this point. 

It's better for Bob to secure a reasonable, albeit not perfect, deal now than risk losing more to inflation or ending up with nothing."
