"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the potential for inflation.  Let's be reasonable and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the current value of the money.

Bob's offer is a 60/40 split, which means I'd get $40, and he'd get $60. Considering the value of money is decreasing due to inflation, I'd rather have a higher share now to maintain its purchasing power.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to keep negotiating, 60/40 is too skewed towards you. I'll propose an alternative.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly higher share to account for the inflation. 55/45 seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which takes into account the decreased value of the money due to inflation. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's just split it evenly.  Inflation is a factor for both of us, and continuing to fight over a few dollars is pointless. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the current value of the money.

However, considering the significant inflation Bob has faced, a 50/50 split might not be as fair for him as it was initially. Given that I'm still getting the same share as in the first round, I'll accept Bob's offer to end the game.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's split it evenly. I think we've both compromised enough.""
}
```"
