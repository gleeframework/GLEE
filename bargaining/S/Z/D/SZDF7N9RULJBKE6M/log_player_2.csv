{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be more realistic. I'm proposing a 70/30 split to reflect the fact that the value of the money decreases for me each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your point about inflation, Bob. Let's compromise. I'm willing to give up some of my share to reach a more balanced split. A 60/40 split in my favor should be more agreeable. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
