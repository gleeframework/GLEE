"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more to start, but we can negotiate.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the original 100$, and Bob will get 30%. I'm being generous to start, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. We both get the same amount, and no need for more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 40$ in the first round's value. But since Bob's offer is to split it evenly, I'll consider the current round's value.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair split and we can end the game.
