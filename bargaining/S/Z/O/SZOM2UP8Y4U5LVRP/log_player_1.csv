"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $100, and Bob would get 30%. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to make a proposal or accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's compromise! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to reassess the offer.

In this round, my gain of $50 would be worth 95% of the original value, so it's equivalent to $47.50.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
