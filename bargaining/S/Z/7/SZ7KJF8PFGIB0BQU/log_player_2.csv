"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. This offer is more balanced.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give up more to get closer to a deal. Your turn again! 
# Bob gain: 70 
# Alice gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This is a good deal for me, and it's better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
