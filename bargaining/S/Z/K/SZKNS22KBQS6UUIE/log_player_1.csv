"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, considering the inflation that will affect Bob more significantly as the rounds progress. This way, Bob still gets a substantial amount, but I'm also protecting my interests given the rules of the game. The message aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the strategic aspect of the game, encouraging him to accept the offer before the value of the money decreases further for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my turn. Inflation is brutal, I need to make up for my potential losses. This is my offer - take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because it significantly favors him, with a 70-30 split, which I find unfair given the initial conditions. The inflation affects Bob more, but this split doesn't account for the equal starting position we had. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round, considering Bob will be even more pressured by the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Inflation is indeed brutal, for you. This is my adjusted offer considering the current state.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that Bob is under more pressure due to the inflation affecting his gains more significantly with each round, I'm adjusting my offer to a 65-35 split in my favor. This still gives Bob a chance to walk away with some money but acknowledges the strategic advantage I have due to the inflation rules. The message is a reminder to Bob of his situation, aiming to persuade him that accepting this offer is better than risking further devaluation of his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing money every round we play. This is my final offer - take it or I walk. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his claim that he's losing money, the split he offers doesn't sufficiently account for the significant devaluation of his gains due to inflation. At this point, Bob's money is worth 48.8% less, making his proposed 60% gain less valuable in real terms. I believe I can still negotiate a better deal for myself, especially since Bob is increasingly pressured by the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""You're right, this is getting ridiculous. But I'm not the one losing value each round. This is my offer, considering the current state of inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm increasing my proposed gain to 70% because, with each round, Bob's potential gains are worth significantly less due to inflation. At this point, Bob is highly motivated to end the game before his potential earnings devalue further. My message acknowledges Bob's frustration but also highlights the reality of the situation, aiming to persuade him that accepting this offer is his best option under the circumstances."
