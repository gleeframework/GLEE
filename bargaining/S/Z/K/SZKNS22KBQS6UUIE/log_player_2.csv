Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed brutal, for you. This is my adjusted offer considering the current state.

# Alice gain: 65

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm losing money every round we play. This is my final offer - take it or I walk.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, this is getting ridiculous. But I'm not the one losing value each round. This is my offer, considering the current state of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are too severe to ignore. While accepting Alice's offer results in a smaller gain, rejecting it means risking an even smaller gain in future rounds. 

Here's why:

* **Shrinking Gains:**  With each round, the value of Bob's potential winnings decreases drastically.  
* **Alice's Advantage:** Alice isn't affected by inflation, so she's content to wait for Bob to become more desperate.
* **No Guarantee:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better, and even a slightly better offer in later rounds might be worth less due to inflation.

It's a tough decision, but accepting the current offer cuts Bob's losses and avoids a potentially worse outcome."
