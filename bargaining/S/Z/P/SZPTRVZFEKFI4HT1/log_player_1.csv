"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50/50 split this time. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my offer would have been equivalent to $6,400 and $1,600 in Round 2. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a more favorable outcome for me.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
