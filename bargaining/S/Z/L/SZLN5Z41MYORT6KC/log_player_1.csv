"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""bob_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Considering the inflation, this ensures we both benefit.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the inflation you'll be facing. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer acknowledges the inflation, it heavily favors him. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the potential gain. It's strategically better to reject and propose a more balanced offer in the next round, even with the impact of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  The longer this goes, the less value there is for both of us.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct Approach:**  Bob's offer was heavily skewed in his favor.  This round focuses on a clear and fair proposal to highlight the benefit of a quick resolution.
* **Time Pressure:**  The message emphasizes that delaying hurts both players due to inflation, making a 50/50 split increasingly attractive.
* **Strategic Simplicity:** A 50/50 split is easy to understand and harder for Bob to justify refusing, especially with the looming pressure of inflation."
