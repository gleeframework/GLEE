Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 5 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. Waiting longer means getting a smaller piece of a shrinking pie.
* **Alice's Pattern:** Alice has consistently aimed for a larger share (60/40, 58/42, 57/43).  This suggests she's unlikely to agree to anything significantly more favorable to Bob. 
* **Time Pressure:** Only 7 rounds remain.  Continuing to reject offers in the hopes of a better deal is increasingly risky, especially since Alice seems entrenched in her desired split.

It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk ending up with nothing if the rounds run out."
