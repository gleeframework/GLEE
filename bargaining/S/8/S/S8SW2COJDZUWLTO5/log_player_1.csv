Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nSince the value of the money for Alice decreases by 20% each round, in Round 4, the money is worth 48.8% less for Alice compared to Round 1. Given this significant decrease and considering Bob's offer is relatively stable and slightly more generous than before, it seems prudent for Alice to accept this offer before the value of her potential gain decreases further in subsequent rounds."
