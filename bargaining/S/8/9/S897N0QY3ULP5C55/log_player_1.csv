"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering the inflation rate is higher for him. The message ""Let's be fair!"" aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get a fair share, and we can end this game early! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation rates, the value of the money I gain is decreasing at a slower rate than Bob's. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round or force Bob to accept a less favorable offer due to the higher inflation rate affecting his gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob a slightly better deal than before, while still taking into account the inflation rates. By saying ""Meet me in the middle!"", I'm trying to convey a sense of compromise and flexibility, which may appeal to Bob and encourage him to accept this offer."
