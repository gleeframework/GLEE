60.0,40.0,"Let's start with a reasonable split. I get $60, you get $40. It's important to agree quickly as the money loses value fast, especially for you, Bob.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,"I think a more even split is fair, considering the inflation. Let's go with 55/45.",Bob,2,
,,"That's not much of a change, Bob.  The inflation hurts you more than me, remember? Let's try to find something fairer in the next round.",Alice,2,reject
65.0,35.0,"Bob, it's clear the clock is ticking faster for you. I'll take a bit more, $65, and you get $35. Let's seal this deal before the money shrinks even further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
60.0,40.0,I'm willing to compromise. Let's go back to the original 60/40 split. We're losing too much value with each passing round.,Bob,4,
,,"Alright Bob, you drive a hard bargain, but a deal's a deal. Let's go with the 60/40 split before it shrinks any further.",Alice,4,accept
