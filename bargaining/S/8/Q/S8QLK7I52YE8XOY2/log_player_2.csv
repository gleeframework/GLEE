Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You can't make a 'final offer' in round 4, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the fact that Bob's gains are decreasing in value. While her offer is closer to the middle, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the impact of inflation on Bob.  It's worth holding out a bit longer to see if she'll offer a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Okay, how about we compromise? This is more than I offered before, but less than you're asking for.""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob needs to start being more flexible, or he risks getting nothing. Offering a slight increase to Alice (while still favoring him overall) might entice her to accept, especially since the value of his offers will continue to decrease."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not sure that's a compromise, Bob. Try harder! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is getting dangerous.  While 35 is significantly less than Bob's initial offers, it's clear Alice is willing to play hardball.  Rejecting this sends a strong signal that Bob won't be pushed around easily, but he needs to offer something more appealing soon, or he risks walking away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 40, ""alice_gain"": 60, ""message"": ""Look, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and these deals are getting worse for me every round.  This is my absolute bottom line.""} 

**Reasoning:**

It's time for a bold move. By mirroring Alice's previous offer, Bob signals that he's serious about getting a deal done, but he's unwilling to be completely taken advantage of.  This offer is likely to be more appealing to Alice now than it would have been a few rounds ago, as she's aware that Bob's position will only weaken."
