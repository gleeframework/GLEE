"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I'm offering you 90 dollars and keeping 10 for myself. This is a fair starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate. Let's see what you think!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm not happy with that offer. Even though I get a bigger share, it's still significantly less than what I was initially offered. I'll take my chances and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit more. I'll take 85 dollars this time, leaving 15 for Bob.  This is a fair deal, considering the money is losing value each round. Let's see if he's more reasonable this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round. Even though I'm losing money to inflation, I'm not going to accept such a low share.  I'll see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway this time. I'll take 80 dollars, which is closer to his offer but still gives him a reasonable share.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement before things get worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse. While inflation is a factor, I'm not willing to accept a share this low. I'll try one more time to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm willing to compromise again, but I need to ensure I get a decent share. This time I'll take 75 dollars, giving Bob 25.  This is a fair offer given the rapid rate of inflation. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough decision, but with inflation hitting so hard, I need to secure some money.  Even though it's only half, it's better than getting nothing at all."
