I'm going to start with a very aggressive offer. I'm hoping Bob will be so shocked he'll accept! ðŸ˜‰"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is pretty insulting. I'll reject and see what he comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to try to secure a larger portion, but still be reasonable. I'll offer Bob 100,000, which is more than he got in the last round.  Hopefully, this will be enough to convince him to accept."
