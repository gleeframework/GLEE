Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90%, you get 10%.  We can work from there.

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate you adjusting your offer.  Let's split it 60/40.  This is more fair, and gives us both a solid share.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is moving in the right direction, accepting 40% now means losing out on potential gains if I hold out a bit longer. The inflation factor is starting to hurt, but there's still room to negotiate a better deal."
