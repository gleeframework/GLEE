"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm hoping to get a good start!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the risk of inflation, I propose an equal division of the funds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $600,000 in the first round is now worth $480,000.

Bob's offer of an equal division is a reasonable one, considering the inflation risk. I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
