Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 60-40 is a fair split.""}\n\n###\n\nI have made an offer to Alice, now it's her turn to decide whether to accept or reject it. I proposed a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Alice, with a message suggesting that this is a fair and balanced split. Let's see what Alice thinks!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think 55-45 is a better reflection of our skills. Let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject Alice's offer from round 3.\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice's proposed division of 55-45 is still not balanced enough for my liking. I believe that an equal or closer to equal split would be more fair, given that the game doesn't specify any particular skills or advantages for either player. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
