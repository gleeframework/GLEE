"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we can avoid the inflation that will kick in later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share this round, but I'm not going to give in too easily! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'd like to get a bigger share to compensate for the decrease in value. However, I don't want to give in too easily either.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is starting to take a toll on the value of the money. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need to prioritize my own gain to keep up with inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share this round, but I'm not going to let you get the better of me! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up. With the money being worth 27.1% less than the original $10,000, I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

However, Bob's offer is still a bit too low for me, considering the decreased value of the money. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now, and I need to be more aggressive in my offer to make up for it. I'll try to push for a higher share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I need a bigger share to keep up with the inflation. Take it or leave it.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in to your desperation, but I'll offer you a 50/50 split to see if you'll finally accept! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on the money's value. With it being worth 40.95% less than the original $10,000, I'm getting very desperate.

However, Bob's 50/50 offer is a tempting one. It's a fair split, and it would allow us to end the game quickly. I'm not sure if I can do better than this, and I don't want to risk waiting for a worse offer.
