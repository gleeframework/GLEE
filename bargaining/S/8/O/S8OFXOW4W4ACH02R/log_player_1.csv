"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split is fairer, with me getting the larger share since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob has changed his mind about the 60-40 split!

I'll think about it for a moment... Since Bob is taking the risk of rejecting my offer, I'm willing to give him a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep a significant amount for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not willing to give up control.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving me $5,500 and Bob $4,500."
