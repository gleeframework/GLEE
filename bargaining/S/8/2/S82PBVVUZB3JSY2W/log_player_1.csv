"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you 20, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point, and I'm keeping the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it evenly. It's fair and straightforward. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to be more cautious since the money is worth less.

I'll reject this offer because I'd rather wait for a better proposal. Splitting it evenly might seem fair, but I think I can do better than that. I'll wait for a more advantageous offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 72,
  ""bob_gain"": 28,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping the majority of the money. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should aim for a compromise. How about this split? 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and I need to be more cautious.

I'll accept this offer. It's a relatively fair compromise, and I'd rather have some money than risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
