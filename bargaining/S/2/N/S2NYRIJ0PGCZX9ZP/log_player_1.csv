"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 75/25 split in my favor, reflecting a fairer distribution than your initial offer. While the money is decreasing in value, I believe this split allows for a more balanced outcome for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{
