"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm aiming for a slightly larger share since the money depreciates faster for Bob. I'll be watching how Bob responds to see if I need to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  Although Bob's offer is closer to 50/50, the rate of inflation is much higher for him.  By rejecting, I can force him to offer me a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm increasing my share again.  Bob's offer was too close to 50/50, and he's losing value at a faster rate. I think I can push for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would have preferred more, Bob's offer is generous, and the rate of inflation is significantly impacting both of us. It's better to take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all."
