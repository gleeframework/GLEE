"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $6000 I would gain in this round is worth less than the $9000 I would have gained in the first round, but it's still a decent offer. I'll accept it.
