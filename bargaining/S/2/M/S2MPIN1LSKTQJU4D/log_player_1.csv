"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to accept a fair division. Since the value of money decreases with each round, I'm hoping Bob will accept this initial offer to maximize his gain.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation we have to deal with. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, even considering the inflation, a 45-55 split in his favor doesn't seem fair to me. The difference in the value depreciation between us (5% for me vs. 20% for Bob) should actually make my share more valuable over time, not less. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation difference, this is more than fair""}\n\nGiven the greater depreciation of the money's value for Bob (20% decrease by now), I'm adjusting my offer to still favor me but by a smaller margin than initially. I believe a 58-42 split is more than fair, considering the circumstances. The message points out the impact of inflation, hoping Bob will see the reason in accepting this offer before the money loses more value for him.\n\n###\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision."
