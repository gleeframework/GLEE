"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000.  This is a fair starting point, and I believe it gives Bob a decent amount considering the potential for inflation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer to have more money, I recognize that with inflation, my share is already significantly reduced.  It's better to accept this offer now and secure some gain than to risk losing even more in subsequent rounds."
