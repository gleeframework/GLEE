Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 50-50, I'll try to get a better deal for myself. Given the inflation rates, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll try to adjust my strategy. Since Alice's offer is closer to the initial 50-50 split, I'll consider it. However, I still want to get a slightly better deal. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 36% less than in the first round, and Alice's offer was 55-45, I'll try to get an even better deal. I'll aim for a higher share, but not too high, since Alice might reject it again. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42}"
