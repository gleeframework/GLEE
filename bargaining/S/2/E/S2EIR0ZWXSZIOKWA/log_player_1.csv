"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll need to consider the relative values. Bob's offer seems a bit skewed in his favor, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm trying to maintain a slight edge, but not too aggressively, considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. Considering the decreased value of the money for me, I'll need to be more aggressive in my proposal to get a fair share.

However, Bob's offer is quite lopsided in his favor, and I don't want to give up too much more value. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth 61.2% less than in the first round now. I'll need to be very aggressive in my proposal to get a decent share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 360000,
  ""bob_gain"": 640000
}
```

I'm trying to take a bit more, but still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money! With the money being worth only 32.77% of its original value, I'll need to be very cautious and take a more extreme stance.

However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure if I'm willing to give up that much more value. I'll reject this offer.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth only 25.58% of its original value now. I'll need to be extremely aggressive in my proposal to get a decent share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm trying to take a bit more, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept, considering the extremely low value of the money."
