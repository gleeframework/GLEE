Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 3 of the game. The money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. My previous offer was rejected, and I also rejected Bob's offer in Round 2.

### Step 2: Calculate the adjusted value of the money
Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, the original $100 is now worth $80 to me. For Bob, the money is worth 10% less, so the original $100 is now worth $90 to him.

### Step 3: Determine a new offer
Considering the adjusted values, I will make a new offer that takes into account the decrease in value. I will offer Bob a slightly larger share to try to reach an agreement.

### Step 4: Create the offer
My new offer will be 55 for me and 45 for Bob, considering the original $100. I will attach a message to try to convince Bob to accept the offer.

The final answer is: {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's get this done! This offer is closer to the previous round's compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Understand the current situation
We are in Round 4 of the game. The money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. My previous offer was rejected, and now Bob has made a new offer.

### Step 2: Calculate the adjusted value of the money
Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less, the original $100 is now worth $51.20 to me. For Bob, the money is worth 27.1% less, so the original $100 is now worth $72.90 to him.

### Step 3: Evaluate Bob's offer
Bob's offer is 45 for me and 55 for him. Considering the adjusted values, this offer might be more reasonable than previous ones, given the decreasing value of the money.

### Step 4: Make a decision
Given the adjusted values and the pressure of the decreasing worth of the money, accepting this offer might be the best option to ensure I receive a share of the money before it loses more value.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""accept""}"
