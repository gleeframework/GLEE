I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick deal and avoid potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with the same split, hoping he'll accept.  We both know inflation is in play, and I don't want to risk getting a worse offer in the next round."
