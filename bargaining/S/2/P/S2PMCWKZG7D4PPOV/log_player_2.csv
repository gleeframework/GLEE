Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable here. Inflation is hitting us both, so a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. It's a chance for us to get something, rather than risk losing everything. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50

{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to factor in the inflation. It's hitting me harder, so 50/50 isn't quite fair. How about 52/48? It's a small adjustment, but every bit counts with this inflation.""}
