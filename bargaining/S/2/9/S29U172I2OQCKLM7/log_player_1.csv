"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let us divide fairly""}\n\nI am offering Bob 450,000 dollars and keeping 550,000 dollars for myself. I am trying to be generous while also keeping in mind that the money is worth less with each passing round. My message to Bob is ""Let us divide fairly"" to appeal to his sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This offer benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Although the money is worth less with each passing round, I am willing to take the risk to try to get a larger share. Additionally, Bob's offer is not significantly better than my initial offer, and I believe I can negotiate a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Don't wait, the money is losing value""}\n\nIn this round, I am increasing my share to 580,000 dollars, while offering Bob 420,000 dollars. My message to Bob is ""Don't wait, the money is losing value"" to emphasize the urgency of the situation and encourage him to accept the offer before the money loses even more value. I am trying to create a sense of pressure to accept the offer, while still being somewhat generous."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable and split this evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI am accepting Bob's offer because, considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, I believe that accepting this offer is the best option. The money I gain is now worth 14.26% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer of an even split is a reasonable compromise. If I were to reject this offer and continue to the next round, the money would lose even more value, and I risk ending up with a worse deal. Therefore, I am choosing to accept the offer and end the game."
