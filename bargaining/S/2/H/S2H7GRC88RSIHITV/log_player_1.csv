I propose to take 900,000 dollars and leave 100,000 dollars for Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my offer to 810,000 for myself and 190,000 for Bob. This accounts for the 10% inflation and still offers a significant amount to Bob.  I believe this is fair, and I hope Bob will see the value in taking this offer."
