"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I think this split is beneficial for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""My turn!  Let's wrap this up. This offer gets us both a good amount.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I need to take the future devaluation into account. If Alice rejects this offer, the pot will be worth 20% less to me in the next round. It's better to secure a slightly larger share now than risk getting even less later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money, and yours is depreciating quickly. I'm offering a reasonable split - let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The devaluation is hitting hard. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than risking another rejection and getting an even worse deal in round 4.  The longer this drags on, the more I lose."
