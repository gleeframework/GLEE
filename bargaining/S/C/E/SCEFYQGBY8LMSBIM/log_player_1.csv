"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'm not as motivated to accept a smaller share. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and having to make another proposal.

I'll decide to:
```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll have to be a bit more aggressive to get a good deal.

Here's my offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```
I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still a 45-55 split, which is a bit closer to my previous offer.

I'll decide to:
```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
