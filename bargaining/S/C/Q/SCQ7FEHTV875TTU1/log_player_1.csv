"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and simple. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiations!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Time to make a new proposal!

Considering the 20% reduction in value due to inflation (10% in each of the two previous rounds), I'll aim for a slightly higher share this time.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob's offer is getting more skewed towards his side with each round!

Considering the significant reduction in value due to inflation (27.1% less than the original $100), I'll think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal this time, given the significant erosion of the money's value.

{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}

It's time for Bob to make a tough decision!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting extremely one-sided!

Considering the massive reduction in value due to inflation (40.95% less than the original $100), I'll think carefully about this offer.

However, I'm not going to let Bob walk all over me. I'll make a last-ditch effort to salvage a decent share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","It's getting desperate!

At this point, the money is worth only a fraction of its original value, and I'm not sure how much more I can squeeze out of the deal.

Considering the extreme inflation, I'll make a very aggressive proposal, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept it.

{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

This is my final offer. If Bob rejects it, I'm not sure what I can do next!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","It's getting ridiculous!

At this point, the money is almost worthless, and Bob's offer is an insult. I'm not going to accept a 5% share of almost nothing.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'm not going to make any more concessions at this point. The money is almost worthless, and I'm not going to accept a tiny fraction of it.

Since the value of the money is now almost negligible, I'll propose a 50-50 split of what's left. It's not like it matters at this point.

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is my last stand. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm not going to make any more proposals."
