"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it down the middle, huh?

I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'll reject the offer for now. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has reduced the money's value by 20% again, so I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting desperate, Bob! Take this or lose out!""
}
```

I'm trying to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, but still leaving him with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the bottom of the barrel, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on me! My gain is now worth a lot less than I initially thought.

Bob's offer is quite aggressive, but I need to think about the bigger picture. If I reject this offer, I'll have to make another proposal, and my gain will be worth even less due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
