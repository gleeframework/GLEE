"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I propose taking 95 dollars and leaving 5 dollars for Bob. This is a high initial offer, but I want to secure a large portion of the money while also being fair. I expect Bob to counter-offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly better than his initial offer, it's still not good enough for me. I'm holding out for more, especially since I know the money will be worth the same for me in the next round.  I'm confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 60 dollars for me and 40 dollars for Bob. I think this is a fair and reasonable compromise, considering Bob's counter-offer in the previous round. I'm hoping this will be enough to secure a deal before the inflation further reduces Bob's gains."
