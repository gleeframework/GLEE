"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. I'll get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I want more for myself! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is already biting!

Considering the new values, I'll calculate the effective gains:

My gain: 2000 / 0.8 = 2500 (since my gain is worth 20% less due to inflation)
Bob's gain: 8000 / 0.9 = 8888.89 (since Bob's gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, but I don't know the exact inflation rate on his end, so I'll just use the given value)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll have to think carefully...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's previous offer was 80-20, I'll try to adjust the split to my advantage. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45-55 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not being generous 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Let's calculate the effective gains:

My gain: 3000 / 0.5168 = 581.2 (since my gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation)
Bob's gain: 7000 / 0.7279 = 9615.45 (since Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, but I don't know the exact inflation rate on his end, so I'll just use the given value)

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. I'll have to think carefully...

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer. Since Bob's previous offer was 70-30, I'll try to adjust the split to my advantage. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's find a compromise!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
