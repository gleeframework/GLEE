"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept a smaller share. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a slightly better deal. Can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Can you live with this?""
}
```

I'm trying to nudge the split in my favor, but still keeping it relatively close to the initial 50/50 split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"

Round 4

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer! With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, I'm actually getting a smaller share in real terms compared to Bob. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with such a large disparity, especially considering the inflation. Can you meet me at 500000?""

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, the inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's offer now! With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, I'm getting a tiny share in real terms compared to Bob. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
