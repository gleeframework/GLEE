Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm offering a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This is a fairly generous offer considering we have 12 rounds to go and the money will depreciate with each passing round. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this early on and we can both walk away with a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is a fair split given the inflation that has already taken place. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I receive something, as the value of the money will continue to decrease with each round."
