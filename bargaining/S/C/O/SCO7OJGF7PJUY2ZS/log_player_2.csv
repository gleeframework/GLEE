This is a tough spot. Ideally, Bob wants a deal closer to a 50/50 split. However:

* **Inflation is eating into Bob's gains:** Each round makes the potential money worth significantly less. 
* **Alice is clearly willing to wait:**  She's betting on Bob caving as the value decreases.

While 390,000 is significantly less than what Bob could have gotten earlier, waiting any longer is likely to result in even worse offers from Alice."
