"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While I understand the inflation factor, Bob's offer is still unfair. He's taking advantage of the situation, and I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 48, ""bob_gain"": 52}
```

I propose a slightly more balanced split. I'll take a 48% share, while Bob gets 52%. This is a compromise acknowledging the inflation, but still ensuring a fair outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is becoming increasingly unfair. Even with the inflation, I refuse to accept such a lopsided split. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm willing to concede slightly more to try and reach an agreement. I'll offer 45% for myself and 55% for Bob. I hope this is a fair compromise, acknowledging the inflation while still ensuring a reasonable outcome."
