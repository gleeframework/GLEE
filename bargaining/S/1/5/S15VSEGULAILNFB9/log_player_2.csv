Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4300

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are really starting to hurt.  While accepting this offer still means losing out on a significant chunk of the initial value, it's better than what Alice is likely to offer in further rounds. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the value of Bob's potential gain decreases significantly. Waiting longer means a drastically smaller reward even if he manages to get a slightly better split.
* **Alice's Stance:**  Her messages suggest she's aware of Bob's predicament and is willing to let inflation work in her favor.  ""Last chance"" implies she's ready to propose even less favorable deals.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a 50/50 split or better is highly unlikely at this stage. The risk of ending up with a much smaller amount due to further inflation outweighs the potential reward of a slightly better offer."
