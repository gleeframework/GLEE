"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can be friends?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a generous offer considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game on a friendly note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if I want to split it evenly, especially since the value of my gain is decreasing with each round. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a slightly better deal for me than his previous offer, considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but we need to reach a compromise. Let's split it 60/40, and avoid losing any more money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not comfortable with the 60/40 split, especially since my gain is worth significantly less than Bob's. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of my gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, so I'll have to make a tough decision. Here's my offer for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, take it or we'll both lose everything!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a slightly better deal for me than his previous offer, considering the inflation factor. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game before it's too late."
