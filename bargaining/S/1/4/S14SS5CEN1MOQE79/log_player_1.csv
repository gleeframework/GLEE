"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a slightly unfair proposal, but I figure it's better to get a good chunk of the money early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is much fairer than my initial proposal, and with inflation, I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round."
