Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Inflation is affecting us both now, and it's time to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n### I accept the offer because, despite the initial advantage Bob had due to inflation not affecting his share, the progressive decrease in the value of my share due to inflation has significantly reduced the overall value I can gain from the money. At this point, an even split seems like the fairest and most reasonable outcome, considering we are more than halfway through the rounds and the diminishing value of the money for me makes further negotiations less advantageous."
