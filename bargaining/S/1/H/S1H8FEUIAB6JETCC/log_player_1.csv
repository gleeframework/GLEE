# Alice gain: 65 
# Bob gain: 35 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Bob's offer. Given the significant impact of inflation on both our ends, especially on Bob's, and the risk of further devaluation if we continue, accepting this offer seems like the most reasonable decision to salvage what's left of the $100. The difference between our proposals has narrowed, indicating a convergence towards a mutually acceptable split. Continuing further risks losing more value than what could be gained from slight adjustments in the division."
