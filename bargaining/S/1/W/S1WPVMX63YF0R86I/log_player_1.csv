"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6000, and Bob gets 40%, which is $4000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I think I can do better than 30% of the total. I'll wait for the next round and hope to make a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, 45-55 split""}

I'm proposing a slightly more aggressive split, but still trying to find a compromise. I think 45% for me and 55% for Bob is a reasonable ask."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but I still want a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer this time. While I was hoping for a slightly better split, I think 40% for me and 60% for Bob is a reasonable compromise, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. I'll take the $4000 and call it a day."
