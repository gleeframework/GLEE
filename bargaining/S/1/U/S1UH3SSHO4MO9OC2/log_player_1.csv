"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous starting offer, considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my potential gain is worth 10% less, so I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, I think it's a reasonable proposal, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
