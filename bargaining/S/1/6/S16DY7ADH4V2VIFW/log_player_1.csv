Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is willing to take a small cut in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a fair split, and the longer we play, the less valuable the money will be for both of us. It's best to take the guaranteed half now."
