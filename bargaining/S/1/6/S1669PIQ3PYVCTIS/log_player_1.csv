"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm going to take a little more this time, but I'm sure we can find a good solution. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'm losing more value due to inflation and Bob is still taking a larger share. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to get a fair deal""}

I'm proposing that I get $4,500 and Bob gets $5,500, trying to find a balance between our gains."
