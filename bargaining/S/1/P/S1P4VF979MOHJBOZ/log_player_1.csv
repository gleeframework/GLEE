Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round.  It's a gamble, but I want to see if Bob will accept an unfair deal right away.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

It's better to take the 50% now than risk getting even less in the next round.  The inflation is going to be a big factor from here on out!"
