"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60% of the remaining money, leaving you with 40%. It's a fair split considering the decreasing value of money over rounds. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
