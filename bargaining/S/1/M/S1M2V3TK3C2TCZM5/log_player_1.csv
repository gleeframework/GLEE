I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, since the money depreciates much faster for Bob than for me.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being greedy. While I lose a lot of value, I can hold out for a better deal. I'll reject and see what he offers next round."

I'm taking a big gamble here, lowering my offer even further. Bob is losing a huge amount of value with each round.  He might be desperate enough to accept a 65/35 split in my favor, especially with only one round left."
