"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll give you a better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think 20% of the original $10,000 is a more reasonable amount for me to gain, considering the initial proposal I made. This offer is too low, and I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 20% less than in the second round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2400,
  ""bob_gain"": 7600,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's split it 52-48!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, which takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will accept this more moderate offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's tempting, $1000 is still a very low amount considering the initial $10,000. With the inflation effect, it's equivalent to only about 8% of the original amount. I'd like to try to negotiate further and aim for a higher share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1200,
  ""bob_gain"": 8800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, let's split it 12-88!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 12-88 split, which is a significant concession on my part. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're really lowballing me, time to think about your own gain 
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 9900 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of me!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because $100 is an insultingly low amount, equivalent to less than 1% of the original $10,000. Considering the significant inflation effect, I'd be better off walking away and risking a random split in a potential future round, rather than accepting such a paltry sum."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. I'll make one final offer.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 150,
  ""bob_gain"": 9850,
  ""message"": ""I'm throwing in the towel, let's just split it 1.5-98.5""
}
```

I'm proposing a 1.5-98.5 split, which is a very low amount for me, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can finally end the game. I'm not sure how much lower I can go!"
