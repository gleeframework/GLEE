**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly impatient, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. While the pressure is on, accepting a poor deal out of fear is not the optimal strategy. There's room to push for a better split, and I'm willing to gamble on one more counter-offer before the potential gains for both of us shrink significantly."
