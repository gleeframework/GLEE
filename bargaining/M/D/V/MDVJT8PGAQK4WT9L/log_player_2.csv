"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's be realistic about the time value of money.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. It was essential to reject it to signal that I won't accept an unfair deal.
* **My counter-offer:**  While it still favors me, it acknowledges the time pressure. 
  * **For Alice:**  A 45/55 split is better than waiting another round and potentially getting even less due to the 10% devaluation. 
  * **For Bob:**  The 5% devaluation makes getting a deal done quickly important. This offer is a good balance between maximizing my gain and securing an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want the bigger share. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, even considering the inflation. While she claims to compromise, the difference between her gain and mine is too large. It's worth risking another round to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be practical. This is a good deal for both of us considering the time pressure. We'll both lose more if this drags on.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **The clock is ticking:** The longer this negotiation goes, the less valuable the money becomes for both of us, especially for Alice.  
* **Finding a middle ground:** My offer is a compromise that still slightly favors me but acknowledges the need to reach an agreement quickly. 
* **Urgency in the message:** I'm emphasizing the need for a swift resolution to encourage Alice to accept.  It's time for us to make a deal and walk away with something."
