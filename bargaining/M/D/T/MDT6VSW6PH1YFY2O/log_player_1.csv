"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, then we can negotiate further if needed.""
}
```

This way, we both get an equal share, and we can see where the game goes from here."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I need to be careful about accepting an offer that gives me a smaller share.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit low for me. I was thinking more like 45 for me.""
}
```"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value of the money. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55 is a fair share for me considering the inflation.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 42, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to eat away at the value of the money. I need to be careful not to get too greedy, but I also want to try to get a better deal.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think 42 is a bit low for me. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 42 is enough, considering the inflation. Can you meet me at 48?""
}
```"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to account for the decreasing value. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,

# Alice gain: 38 
# Bob gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money now, and I'm starting to get worried about the time left. I need to think carefully about this offer.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, 38 is actually a relatively good offer for me, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate for a better deal, but I'll also keep in mind that I might not be able to get a better offer later on. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 38 is enough, but I'm also getting worried about the time left. Can you meet me at 42?""
