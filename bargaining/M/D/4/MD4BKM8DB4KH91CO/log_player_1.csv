"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money 60/40 in my favor.  This is a fair offer considering the potential for inflation, and I'm confident we can reach a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
