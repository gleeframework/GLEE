"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the high road, but I'm not getting ripped off! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to adjust my thinking. With the 20% inflation, my gain of $2,000 is worth $1,600 in the previous round's value.

I'm not thrilled with the 20/80 split, but I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject. Since I'm not sure how the inflation affects Bob, I'll have to be cautious.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to see if I can do better.
