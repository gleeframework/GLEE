"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest, let's agree and end this early! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to be more careful.

I'm not sure if a 50/50 split is the best option for me, considering the reduced value of money. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $45, which is a slightly better deal for him, but I'm keeping $55 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need at least 55 to make it worth my while. Let's finish this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll! With the reduced value of money, I'll have to be even more careful.

Considering the reduced value of money, Bob's offer of $55 for him and $45 for me is actually a good deal for me, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll accept this offer, as it's a decent compromise.
