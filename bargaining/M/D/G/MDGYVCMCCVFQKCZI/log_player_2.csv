"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. This gives us both a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money loses value with each passing round, especially more significantly for Alice, I believe there's room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a more balanced offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more, we need to find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Alice's mention of compromise, the offer doesn't significantly improve my share considering the devaluation of money. The impact of inflation is more severe on Alice's share, which gives me leverage to push for a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Analyze the impact of inflation on both players.
Given that with each round, the money is worth 5% less for me (Bob) and 20% less for Alice, we need to factor this into our offers. By round 4, the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round (considering compound inflation: 0.95^3 = 0.857375 for me), and for Alice, it's worth 48.8% less (0.8^3 = 0.512 for Alice).

### Step 2: Consider the previous offers and the decreasing value of money.
Alice's last offer gave me $380,000, which, adjusted for inflation, is less valuable now. Considering the significant decrease in value for Alice, she might be more inclined to accept a slightly more favorable offer for me to secure her share before it devalues further.

### Step 3: Formulate an offer that takes into account the devaluation and aims for a compromise.
Given the devaluation, aiming for a higher amount than before might compensate for the loss in value, but it's crucial to balance this so Alice will accept. Aiming higher than before but not so high as to deter Alice, considering her losses to inflation.

### Step 4: Craft a message to accompany the offer, highlighting the reasoning and the mutual benefit.
The message should emphasize the urgency due to inflation and the mutual benefit of accepting this offer before the money devalues further.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 460000, ""alice_gain"": 540000, ""message"": ""Given the significant impact of inflation on both our shares, I believe this offer strikes a fair balance, considering the devaluation we're both facing. Accepting now would secure our shares before they lose further value.""}"
