"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in ending the game early and accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You'll regret rejecting my first offer! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to make up for the rejection by offering a larger share to himself. However, I'm not going to fall for it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up $700,000, even if it's worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $700,000, and the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, that's equivalent to $560,000 in the first round. I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, I am! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another offer from Bob! Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll take a closer look. However, I'm not convinced that I'm getting the better deal this time either. I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm waiting for a better offer from Bob or for the game to end."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. Since the money is worth 61.2% of its original value now, I'll offer a higher share to myself to compensate for the loss:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Time's running out, Bob!""
}
```"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, trying to balance the risk of inflation with the need to get a good deal. Since the money is worth 73.44% of its original value now, I'll offer a slightly higher share to myself:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob!""
}
```"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, finally! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split! It's a fair offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. Considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, I'll think about it for a moment...
