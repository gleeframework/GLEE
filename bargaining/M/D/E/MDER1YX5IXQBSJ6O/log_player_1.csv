"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose that I get 900,000 dollars and Bob gets 100,000 dollars. This is a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
``` 

I'm reducing my share slightly to account for the inflation, but still offering Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 810000

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 729000, ""bob_gain"": 271000}

I'm adjusting my offer again to reflect the inflation.  While it's a significant loss, it's still better than accepting Bob's offer and getting only 190,000."

While I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, it's better to accept this offer than to risk further losses in the next round."
