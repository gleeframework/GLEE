"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to get a fair deal and set the tone for the rest of the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'd rather aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value. However, I don't want to risk going too low and getting nothing.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less now (5% less than the initial 5% less), I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob, considering the decreasing value of the money."
