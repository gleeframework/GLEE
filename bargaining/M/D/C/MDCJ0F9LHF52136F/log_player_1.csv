"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair and simple solution!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I'll take $500,000 and Bob will take $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the risk of inflation. Let's get this over with! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I think I can do better.

{
""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!""
}

I'm offering a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial offer, but still leaves me with a decent chunk of the money."
