Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a compromise. It accounts for the decreasing value and gives us both a reasonable share. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most strategic decision. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game continues, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Bob. His 20% per round devaluation makes accepting a somewhat reasonable offer now better than risking a worse offer later.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in Round 5 is risky. Bob's offers have been getting closer to a 50/50 split. If we reject this, there's a chance his next offer might be even less favorable, and the value will have decreased even more. 
* **Present Value:** A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. Accepting 600,000 now, even with the 14.26% devaluation, might be a better overall outcome than a potentially slightly higher offer later that's been devalued even further.

It's a tough call, but in a scenario with such rapid devaluation, sometimes accepting a decent offer is the best course of action."
