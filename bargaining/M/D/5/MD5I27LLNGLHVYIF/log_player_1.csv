"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

This offer gives me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's compromise 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a 20% reduction from his previous offer of $4,000, which is now worth $3,200 in real terms. Meeting me halfway would be a good compromise, and I'd be getting $5,000, which is a decent share. I'll accept this offer.
