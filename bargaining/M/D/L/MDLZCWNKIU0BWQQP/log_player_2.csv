Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000

**Reasoning:**

It's painful, but at this stage, accepting is the most logical choice. 

* **Severe Inflation:**  The 73.79% inflation hit is crippling. Rejecting this offer means risking even worse deals in the remaining rounds.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has consistently offered deals favoring herself. There's little indication she'll suddenly be generous in the later rounds.
* **Time Pressure:** With only 5 rounds remaining, the pressure is immense. Holding out for a significantly better offer is risky, and getting nothing is a real possibility.

While $430,000 is significantly less than desired, it's better than walking away empty-handed if negotiations fail."
