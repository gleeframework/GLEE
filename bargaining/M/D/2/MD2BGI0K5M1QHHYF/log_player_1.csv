"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair starting point and leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a fair split and see if we can improve from here. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In this round, the total amount of money is still $10,000, but it's worth 90% of its original value due to inflation.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer now versus the potential gains I might get in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 81% of its original value due to 10% inflation for 2 rounds. I'll have to be more aggressive with my offer to account for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a good deal to make up for inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself. My message is a bit more assertive, emphasizing the need for a good deal due to inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! In this round, the total amount of money is still $10,000, but it's worth 63.9% of its original value (90% * 0.9 = 0.81 * 0.9 = 0.729, but since we're considering the money in the 4th round, the value is 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.729 * 0.9 = 0.6579, but for simplicity we'll consider it 0.7 * 0.9 = 0.63).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best strategy for me. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting $4,530 (4500 * 0.63), which is a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.
