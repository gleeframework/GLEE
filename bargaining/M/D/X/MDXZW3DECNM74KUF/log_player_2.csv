{""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite unbalanced. Let's be fair - I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  This accounts for the time value of money given the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 40%.  Let's split it 65/35 in my favor.  This accounts for the fact that we're both losing value due to inflation, and it's a fairer split than your last offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,

""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and the value is decreasing with each round.  My last offer was more than fair. I'm willing to meet you halfway - 55/45 split in my favor seems like a reasonable compromise considering the inflation.""}
