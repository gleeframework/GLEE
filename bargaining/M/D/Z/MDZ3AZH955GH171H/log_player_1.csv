"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

```

I propose that I take $90 and Bob takes $10. I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While the inflation is hurting me, I can still get more money by making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'll offer Bob $40, keeping $60 for myself. Even with the inflation, this is still a better deal than the $5 he offered me. Hopefully, he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept this offer."
