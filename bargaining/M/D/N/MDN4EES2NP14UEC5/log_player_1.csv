"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split.  This is a fair starting point considering our differing inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the 10% and 20% inflation rates, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'll think of the offer in terms of the original amount. In that case, I'd be getting 400,000 / 0.9 = 444,444.44 in today's value.

The offer seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.
