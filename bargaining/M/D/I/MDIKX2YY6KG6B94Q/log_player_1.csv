Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the $10,000."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather not leave with $4,000, I want a bit more.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get the better deal!

I'll think about it...

I'll accept this offer. It's not ideal, but it's a fair split and I'd rather have $4,500 than nothing at all.
