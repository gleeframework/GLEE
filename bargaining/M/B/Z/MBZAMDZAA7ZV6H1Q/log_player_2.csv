Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the deal is getting worse due to inflation, accepting 45 now is worse than holding out for a potentially better offer in the next round where I can propose again.  Alice's devaluation is less severe than mine, so she's feeling less pressure. I need to remain firm to signal I'm willing to risk it all to get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time! This is getting ridiculous.  Take this deal before inflation eats away at the whole thing!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going below 53 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is killing us!  While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting 47 now is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds. Alice seems firm on not going below 53, and the value of the money will only continue to plummet."
