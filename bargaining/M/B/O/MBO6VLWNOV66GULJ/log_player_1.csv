"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep 90% of the money and give Bob 10%. This way, I ensure a significant portion of the money while still giving Bob something. I believe this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation rates will affect Bob's share more significantly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I propose to keep 85% of the money and give Bob 15%.  This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, reflecting the inflation that's impacting both of us. I'm still aiming for a fair share but also recognizing the need to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Bob's offer is much less favorable than my previous offers, but the inflation is starting to take a heavy toll on both of us.  It's better to accept some money now rather than risk getting nothing at all in the future."
