"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split.  I figure it's fair since I'm making the first offer, and I'm being generous.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation and that Bob is making the offer."
