Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm taking almost everything, but I figure a dollar is better than nothing for him, and it might encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much better deal for me than getting nothing. I'm not sure if Bob will be generous again, and the inflation is going to hurt me in the next round. I'll take the 500,000."
