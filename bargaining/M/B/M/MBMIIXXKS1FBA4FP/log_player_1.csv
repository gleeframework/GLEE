"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44 (due to 10% inflation)
Bob gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79 (due to 5% inflation)

I'll accept Bob's offer.
