"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair to me.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and leaving Bob with $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate, my gain of $5,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $4,500. Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's effectively $4,000.

Since this offer is a 50-50 split, I'll accept it.
