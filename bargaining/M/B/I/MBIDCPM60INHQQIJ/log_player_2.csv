"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting fair, but I'll need a bigger share in the next rounds to keep up with the inflation! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially since I know Alice will be demanding more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but we need to find a solution quickly to avoid losing too much to inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but we need to act fast.  I can't afford to keep losing money to inflation like this. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share,  Alice's offer is reasonable given the inflation. It's better to secure some money now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
