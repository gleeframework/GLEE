"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount and can still have a good chance of negotiating further.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness in the first round, Alice. But with the inflation risk, I believe it's best for us both to aim for a slightly more favorable deal.  This split allows us both to gain a good amount, while accounting for potential future losses. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so the $6,000 I would have gotten is now worth $5,400.

Considering the new offer, I think I can do better than a 40-60 split. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round (90% of 90% = 81%). So, if I were to propose the same 60-40 split as in round 1, I would get $5,040 and Bob would get $4,560.

However, I think I can do better than that. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise a bit more to get a better deal. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm still ahead.""
}
```"
