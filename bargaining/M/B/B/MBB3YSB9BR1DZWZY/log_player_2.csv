"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount and can still have a good chance of negotiating further. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's tempting to take a fair split, but with the inflation risk, it's better to see if Alice is willing to give more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness in the first round, Alice. But with the inflation risk, I believe it's best for us both to aim for a slightly more favorable deal.  This split allows us both to gain a good amount, while accounting for potential future losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more to get a better deal. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'm still ahead. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd ideally prefer a larger share, the 19% inflation loss makes accepting this offer a more secure option. It's a decent gain, and Alice is likely to hold firm on this deal."
