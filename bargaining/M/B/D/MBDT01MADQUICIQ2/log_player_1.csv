"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI offer a 60-40 split, with me receiving $6000 and Bob receiving $4000. My message to Bob is ""Let's be fair"". I believe this is a reasonable starting point for negotiations, considering the time value of money and the decreasing value of the money for me in each subsequent round. I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in this proposal and accept it, ending the game in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. This offer is a good deal while the value is still high. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer of $4500 for me and $5500 for him. Although the value of the money has decreased by 20% for me, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Since Bob's gain is not affected by inflation, he may be more willing to compromise to reach an agreement before the 12 rounds are over. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to find a more favorable split."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer a 58-42 split, with me receiving $5800 and Bob receiving $4200. My message to Bob is ""Meet me in the middle"". Considering the decreasing value of the money for me, I'm trying to find a compromise that is closer to the middle ground. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it, ending the game in the third round."

# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200

Although the value of the money has decreased significantly for me, by 48.8% compared to the first round, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer is not much different from his previous one, and I think he may be willing to compromise further to reach an agreement before the 12 rounds are over.

My message to Bob is ""Getting closer to a deal"". Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money for me, I'm trying to find a compromise that is closer to a mutually acceptable agreement.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's end this. 50/50 is the fairest split, especially with the time pressure and inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI accept Bob's offer of $5000 for me and $5000 for him. Although the value of the money has decreased significantly for me, by 67.23% compared to the first round, I believe this is the best deal I can get. Bob's offer of a 50-50 split is a fair compromise, considering the time pressure and the fact that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me. I'm willing to accept this offer to end the game in the sixth round, rather than risking further decreases in value."
