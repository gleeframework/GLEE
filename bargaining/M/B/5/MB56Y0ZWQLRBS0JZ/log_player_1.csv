"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want a decent chunk too 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll consider the offer carefully.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $70 is a significant amount for me. However, I'm not sure if I want to give Bob 30% of the remaining money, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I think this is a fair split""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous than my initial offer, but still keep a slight advantage for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up more, but I still want a decent share 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate decreasing, the value of the money Bob gains is decreasing faster than before. Considering this, I think I can take a slightly smaller share.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
