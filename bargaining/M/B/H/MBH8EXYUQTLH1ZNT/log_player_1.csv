I'll start by offering Bob a small share, hoping to secure a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is a lot better for him than my initial offer, but I'm still getting a sizable chunk. Since the money is worth less each round, it makes sense to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering Bob a bit more this time, but still keeping a larger share for myself.  With inflation continuing, I need to secure a decent amount before it drops too much further."
