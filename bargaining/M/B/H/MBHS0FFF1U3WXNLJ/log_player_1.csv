"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or proceed to Round 2."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but you can't complain about the 60% 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 60 * 0.95 = 57
* Bob's gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but it's better than nothing. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
