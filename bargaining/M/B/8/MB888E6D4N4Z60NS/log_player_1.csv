"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $700,000, and Bob gets the remaining 30%, which is $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $400,000, and Bob's gain of $500,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $450,000.

I'll reject this offer since I'd prefer to get more than $400,000.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In this round, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2, so I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the reduced $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the money in this round:

My gain of $550,000 is worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8%), which is $551,200.
Bob's gain of $450,000 is worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1%), which is $327,900.

I'll accept this offer since I'd prefer to get a guaranteed $551,200 rather than risking a potentially lower value in the next round.
