"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Fair share for both""}\n\n### AI: Round 1\n\nI'll start by proposing a division where I, Alice, receive $60 and Bob receives $40. I've attached a message that says ""Fair share for both,"" indicating that I believe this division is reasonable and gives both of us a significant portion of the money. Since the money's value decreases with each round, I'm aiming to find a balance that Bob will accept to avoid further devaluation. Now, it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more fair this time. I'm taking a bit more, but we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### AI: Round 2\n\nConsidering the adjusted values due to inflation, Bob's offer gives me $45, which is now worth 20% less, making it effectively $36. Bob gets $55, but it's only worth 10% less, making it effectively $49.50. Despite the decrease in value, Bob's message suggests a compromise, and given the decreasing value of money with each round, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons of accepting this offer versus risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decide to reject the offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### AI: Round 3\n\nGiven the decreasing value of money, I need to consider how to balance my proposal to make it appealing to Bob while ensuring I get a fair share. Since Bob's previous offer was $55 for him and $45 for me, I'll adjust my proposal to be closer to his, while still aiming for a bit more for myself. I'll also try to convey a sense of compromise in my message.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway""}\n\nIn this round, I propose that I receive $52 and Bob receives $48, with a message indicating that I'm trying to find a middle ground between our previous offers. The money's value continues to decrease, so finding an acceptable division quickly is crucial."
