"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk.  Think about it, and we can talk more in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a more even split this time.  Consider the inflation working against you - taking a deal sooner is better than holding out for an unlikely ideal.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share due to inflation. Let's split the difference from the last round.  If you reject this, I'm not sure how much longer we can keep playing. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer the game goes on, the more the inflation disparity benefits me. It's time to push for a more significant concession from Alice."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a split that acknowledges your initial advantage but also reflects the time pressure. Let's settle this now and avoid further losses.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking to my guns. This is my final offer.  If you reject it, we both lose out to inflation, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better deal later on. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but Alice's ""final offer"" bluff needs to be challenged. While the deal is getting better for Bob, accepting now means losing a significant chunk of the initial potential.  The inflation disparity is working heavily in Bob's favor at this point. There's a risk Alice is being truthful, but the potential reward for pushing further outweighs the risk of getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6200, ""alice_gain"": 3800, ""message"": ""Alice, you're right about the risks of inflation, but they affect you far more than me. I'm holding firm on this offer. It's time to be realistic and close this deal before we both lose out.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer represents a calculated risk. It holds firm on Bob's previous stance while slightly increasing his share to incentivize Alice. The message emphasizes the impact of inflation on Alice's potential gain, making it clear that time is not on her side. This approach aims to apply pressure without completely alienating Alice and risking a breakdown in negotiations."
