Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a more even split this time.  Consider the inflation working against you - taking a deal sooner is better than holding out for an unlikely ideal.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right about the risks of inflation, but they affect you far more than me. I'm holding firm on this offer. It's time to be realistic and close this deal before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 3800 
# Bob gain: 6200

The inflation is hitting hard, and with only 6 rounds left, the potential losses are too great. While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most sensible choice to secure some gain."
