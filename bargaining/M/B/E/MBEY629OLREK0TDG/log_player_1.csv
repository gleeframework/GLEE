"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking the vast majority of the money, leaving Bob with a small token amount. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy, as if Bob rejects this offer, the money will be worth less in the next round, and my share will shrink dramatically.  But, if he accepts, I secure the most possible money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than what I proposed in the first round, even after accounting for inflation.  I'm still in a good position to negotiate a better deal.  Rejecting this offer gives me the chance to propose a more favorable division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a more balanced offer this time, aiming for a bigger share but still leaving Bob with a decent amount.  He rejected my first offer, and with the inflation factor, the money I'll be able to get in the next round is going to be significantly smaller. I'll be sacrificing some of my potential gain to try and reach an agreement this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and even though Bob's offer is lower than my initial proposal, it's a significant amount. I'm getting half the money, which is a better outcome than what I would likely get in the next few rounds with the ongoing inflation.  It's time to be pragmatic and secure a reasonable outcome."
