"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4,500.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. Meeting halfway seems reasonable, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the better deal.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, Bob. But I still think I deserve a bit more. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer by $500, hoping to get a better deal than the previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, Alice. I think this is a fairer split than your previous offer. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the offers, I think Bob's offer is still a bit too generous to me, given the current state of the economy. I'd like to get a bit more, considering the value of my gain is decreasing rapidly.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit desperate, Bob. I need a better deal to make up for the inflation. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more, but I'm not sure if Bob will accept this offer. The value of my gain is decreasing rapidly, and I need to make a move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to get worried about the inflation, Alice. I think we need to make a deal soon. This is my best offer so far, let's see if you can accept it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With the current offer, my gain of $5,000 is worth only about 60% of its original value.

Considering the situation, I think I should accept this offer. It's a 50-50 split, which is a fair deal considering the circumstances. I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting an even worse deal.

I'll accept the offer.
