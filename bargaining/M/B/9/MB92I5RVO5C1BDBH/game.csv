,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial outcome.,Bob,2,

50.0,50.0,"Let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest option, and it avoids the risk of further inflation. Let's agree and be done with it.",Alice,3,

40.0,60.0,"Alice, I'm sticking to my initial stance - I think we can both do better than a 50/50 split. Let's not forget, your money is losing value much faster than mine. I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, which is still fair considering the inflation we're dealing with.  Let's avoid the risk of losing more value by coming to an agreement.",Bob,4,
