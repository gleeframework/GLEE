"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I take $60, you take $40. It's a good deal for both of us, especially considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your cut last round was a bit greedy. Let's be fairer to each other. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value decreases with each round, and this back and forth isn't helping either of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical solution at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
