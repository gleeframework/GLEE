"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a small difference, we can always negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping to leave room for further negotiation and considering the potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A more even split this time!

I accept the offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
