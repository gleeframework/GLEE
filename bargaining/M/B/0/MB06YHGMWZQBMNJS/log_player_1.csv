"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain of 45 is now worth less than my initial gain of 60, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, 45 is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

I accept this offer.
