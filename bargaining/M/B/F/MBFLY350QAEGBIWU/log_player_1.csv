"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nSince this is the first round, I'll aim for a relatively even split, slightly favoring myself to account for the potential decrease in value over subsequent rounds. I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in this offer and accept it to avoid further devaluation of the money for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's be reasonable. This is more than you would have gotten last round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, although it might seem like a significant amount, considering the devaluation due to inflation, the actual value I'd receive is less than what I initially proposed for myself. Given the rate of inflation impacting my gains more significantly than Bob's, I need to be strategic and aim for a better split in the next round, hoping the potential loss will motivate Bob to accept a more favorable division for me."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, I'm adjusting my proposal to slightly favor myself again but still aim for a relatively fair split that Bob might find acceptable. The message is designed to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the shared concern about the decreasing value of the money, hoping he'll see the mutual benefit in accepting this offer rather than risking further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I have to factor in inflation too, this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gains, with a 27.1% decrease in value since the first round, and considering Bob's message that this is his final offer, I believe accepting this proposal is the most strategic decision. The difference between our gains is not substantial enough to warrant risking another round, which would further diminish the value of the money I receive. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a significant amount, albeit less than initially hoped, rather than risking a potentially worse outcome or a breakdown in negotiations."
