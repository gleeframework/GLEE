I'm offering Bob a tiny share, hoping he'll be greedy and accept it.  I'm betting that he doesn't realize how quickly the value of the money will decrease for him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is still significantly better than what I was originally going to get. It's risky to reject and gamble on getting a better offer, especially considering I don't know how the inflation is affecting him. It's best to take what I can get."
