"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll calculate my gain as 400000 * 0.9 = 360000.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
