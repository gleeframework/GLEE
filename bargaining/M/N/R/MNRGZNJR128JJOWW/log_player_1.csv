"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need for further negotiations""
}
```

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'd like to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need a better deal""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going any higher""
