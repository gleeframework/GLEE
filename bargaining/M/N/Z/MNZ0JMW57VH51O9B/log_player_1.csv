"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This way, we both get $50, and we can finish the game if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll consider the effective values. For Bob's offer, he's proposing that he gets $60, which is worth 90% of $67.50 (the original $60 with 10% less value due to inflation). That's a good deal for me, and it's a higher value than my original proposal. I'll accept this offer.
