"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair and reasonable proposal""
}

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable split, considering we're starting with a large amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but I think this is a more balanced split 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, but I'm willing to compromise. Bob's new offer is a bit more balanced, but I still think I should get a bit more. I'll accept this offer for now, but I'm not giving up on getting a better deal.
