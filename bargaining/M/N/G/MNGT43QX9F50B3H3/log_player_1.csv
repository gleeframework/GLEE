"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money I gain is still worth 8000 dollars, but the money Bob gains is now worth 1800 dollars.

I'll reject this offer since I can get more than 1800 dollars.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 90% of its original value now (due to 10% inflation in each round), I'll offer a slightly lower amount to Bob.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

* My gain: 8000 dollars (same as in the first round)
* Bob's gain: 6000 dollars, but it's worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%)

So, my gain is worth 8000 dollars, and Bob's gain is worth 4320 dollars (6000 x 0.72).

I'll accept this offer since it's a better deal for me than my previous offer.
