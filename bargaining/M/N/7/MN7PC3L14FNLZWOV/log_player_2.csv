Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm also willing to compromise, let's split the difference again 
# Bob gain: 437500 
# Alice gain: 562500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, the game's dynamics are changing rapidly due to inflation. Accepting this offer would still give Alice a significantly larger share, and the decreasing value of the money means Bob should aim higher while it's still worth fighting for."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 512500,
""alice_gain"": 487500,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to settle this now.  This is a compromise, and it's the best offer you'll get at this point.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency:** With six rounds gone, the clock is ticking, and the stakes are rising. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Inflation is eroding the value of the potential winnings with each passing round.  
* **Strong Position:**  Bob has consistently offered increasingly reasonable splits, while Alice has been less flexible. This offer gives a slight edge to Bob but ensures a deal gets done before the money loses too much value."
