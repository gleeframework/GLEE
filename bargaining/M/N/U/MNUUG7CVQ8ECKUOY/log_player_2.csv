"Round 1
Alice's offer:

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair at first glance, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this game and both walk away happy.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4775 
# Alice gain: 5225 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a 50/50 split, inflation is making things worse for me.  Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something."
