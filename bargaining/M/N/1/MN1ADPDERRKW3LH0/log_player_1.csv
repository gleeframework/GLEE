Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's make a deal, Alice. I understand splitting evenly seems fair, but this round is your best chance to secure a good amount. The value decreases for you each time we pass. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
