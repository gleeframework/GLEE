Let's see what I can get!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's see if Alice is willing to accept that."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like a bigger share, inflation is a real threat. Accepting this offer is the best way to guarantee I get something."
