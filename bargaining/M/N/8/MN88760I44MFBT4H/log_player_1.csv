"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This is a pretty standard 60-40 split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can move on to the next round before the money starts to devalue."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, which is even more favorable to him than my initial offer, I'll reject it. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split. Here's my new offer:

# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is devaluing quickly! Bob's offer is still a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to him than my previous offer. However, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","The money is devaluing rapidly! With the current inflation rates, I'll aim for a more aggressive split to account for the reduced value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50

I'm going for a 50-50 split, hoping to balance out the devaluation and get a fair share of the remaining money."
