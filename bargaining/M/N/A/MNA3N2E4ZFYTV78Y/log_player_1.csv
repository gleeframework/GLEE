"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer if he'd like."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I'm not giving up yet!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm looking for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself while still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up all my leverage 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal. The fact that Bob's offer is slightly more generous than before suggests that he's trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to settle for this amount yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit impatient, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Don't expect me to go any lower!""
}
```

I'm trying to make a stronger push for a better deal, while still leaving some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting any more generous, take it or leave it 
# Alice gain: 9000 
# Bob gain: 1000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to squeeze the last bit of value out of the deal!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. While I was hoping to get a better deal, the fact that Bob is only offering me $9000 (which is worth significantly less than the original $10,000 due to inflation) means that I'm not getting a great deal. However, I'm not willing to risk going to another round and potentially getting an even worse deal."
