"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you $100,000, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer to see if Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, it's a good starting point, let's see if we can do better. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 2, the money is worth less due to inflation.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide. Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $320,000 to me. Bob's gain of $600,000 is worth... well, I don't know how much it's worth to him due to the unknown inflation rate, but it's still a significant amount.

I'll accept Bob's offer to move on to the next round.
