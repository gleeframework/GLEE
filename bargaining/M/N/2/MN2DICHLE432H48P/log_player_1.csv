"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair and reasonable starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new values, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my next offer, taking into account the 5% reduction in value due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm trying to make a slightly more favorable offer for myself, but still keeping it reasonable to see if Bob will accept."
