"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. 90% for me, 10% for you. You can try to negotiate if you want.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 10% share, which is $100,000. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can end the game here."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal. You can try to negotiate further if you want. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my share of $300,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $270,000. Still a decent offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the previous offers, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's more favorable to me. Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 70% for him, I'll try to aim for a higher percentage for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. 55% for me, 45% for you. Let's see if we can agree on this.""
