**Reasoning:**

While Alice is inching closer to a more even split, time is working against me much faster than her. It's still beneficial for me to hold out and hope for a better offer in the next round or two."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking and we both lose if this keeps up. I propose a fair 50/50 split.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money. An even split is now the most logical choice to ensure we both walk away with something substantial.  Delaying further significantly hurts both of us."
