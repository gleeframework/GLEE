"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This offer is a little cheeky, but I want to see how Bob reacts. I'm giving him the bare minimum, hoping he'll reject it and give me a chance to make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm accepting this offer.  While I could potentially get more by rejecting, the risk of inflation is too high. A 50/50 split is a fair deal, and I don't want to risk getting less in future rounds."
