"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm starting with a fair split to see if Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor, I need to be more cautious. Since Bob is offering me 40, which is less than what I initially proposed, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains. Here's my revised offer for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm trying to be more aggressive, but not too greedy, considering the inflation."
