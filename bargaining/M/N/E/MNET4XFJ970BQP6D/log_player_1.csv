"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a 90/10 split in my favor. Since I'm the first to propose, I'm taking the lion's share, but leaving a small amount for Bob. I hope he'll be reasonable and accept, knowing that the value of the money will decrease in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is clearly unfair. While the money is worth less to me due to inflation,  I'm not going to accept getting only 5 dollars while he gets 95! I'll reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a larger share, but recognizing that Bob might be getting more demanding.  Offering 80 for myself and 20 for Bob is a compromise.  I believe this is a fair offer given the inflation and the fact that I get to make the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the inflation has significantly reduced the value of my gains, I'm still not going to accept getting only 10 dollars while Bob gets 90.  The game is still very early and I'm not going to give in to this kind of pressure. I need to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm still going to try to get a decent share.  This offer gives Bob a larger share than before, but I still believe it's a fair split considering how much the money is worth less to me now.  I'm hoping he'll see the value of getting something rather than risking getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the value of the money has decreased significantly for me, I still find Bob's offer very unfair. I'm not willing to accept a mere 15 dollars while he gets 85. I need to push for a more equitable split. I still have a few rounds left, and I'm not going to give up without a fight."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm not going to give up completely. This offer gives Bob a larger share than before, but it's still a decent amount for both of us. I'm hoping he'll recognize the value of a secure deal at this point, considering the money is worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still unacceptable. While inflation is hitting me hard, I'm not going to give in to pressure and accept a small share while Bob gets a huge one.  I need to see if I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm not giving up just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for me, but I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob than the previous ones. I'm willing to compromise to avoid both of us getting nothing at this point."
