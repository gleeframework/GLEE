"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $600,000, which is 60% of the original amount. This way, we can both get a significant share of the money and avoid going into too many rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to be more cautious. I'll think carefully about this offer. Since Bob is offering me $300,000, which is 30% of the original amount, I'll decide to reject this offer. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $680,000, which is 68% of the original amount, and keeping $320,000 for myself. This way, I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than the previous offer, while still being reasonable."
