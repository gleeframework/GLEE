"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, it's fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. Your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm looking for a good deal. However, Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, so I need to consider that as well.

After some thought, I decide to reject this offer. I think I can do better than 4000. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more favorable ratio for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
