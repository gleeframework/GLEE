I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a small share in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not happy with this offer, but I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a larger share. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob."
