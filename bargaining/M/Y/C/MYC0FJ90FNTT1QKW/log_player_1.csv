"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, with the message that this is a fair and balanced split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll need to consider that.

Since Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, that means he's offering me $5,000 in real terms, but it's worth 25% of the original $10,000 ($2,500).

My gain of $5,000 is still worth $5,000 in real terms.

Considering this, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
