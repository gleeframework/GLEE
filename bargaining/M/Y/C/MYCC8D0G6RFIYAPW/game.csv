300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a sizable chunk upfront.  Dragging this out only hurts me with inflation, but a 70/30 split ensures we both benefit.",Bob,2,

750000.0,250000.0,"Bob, it seems like you're feeling the inflation pinch already. I'm willing to be more generous than my last offer, but we need to find a middle ground. This is a fair split considering the time pressure and the decreasing value of your share.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I understand you're aiming for a larger share, but my offer is more than fair.  Let's wrap this up - 60/40 is a strong deal before inflation eats away at my side even more.",Bob,4,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I'm trying to reach a compromise here.  I've lowered my ask again to reflect the shrinking pot, but 65/35 is my bottom line.  We're running out of time, and further delays will only hurt you more.",Alice,5,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, this back-and-forth is unnecessary.  I'm holding firm at 55/45. This is a fair split that acknowledges the time pressure we're both under. Accept this offer, and we both walk away with a respectable sum.",Bob,6,

600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement.  I'm sticking with 60/40. This factors in the significant impact inflation is having on your share. Let's settle this now before it dwindles any further.",Alice,7,
