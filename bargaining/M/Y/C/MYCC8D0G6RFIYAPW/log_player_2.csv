"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal, Bob. This offer is highly advantageous for me in the long run, but you get a decent sum upfront.  Consider the decreasing value of the money -  it's in your best interest to settle quickly.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it seems like you're feeling the inflation pinch already. I'm willing to be more generous than my last offer, but we need to find a middle ground. This is a fair split considering the time pressure and the decreasing value of your share. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000

""alice_gain"": 400000,

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to reach a compromise here.  I've lowered my ask again to reflect the shrinking pot, but 65/35 is my bottom line.  We're running out of time, and further delays will only hurt you more. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing a significant portion of the potential gain.  Alice is clearly trying to leverage the inflation against me. I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it means taking a risk in the later rounds."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to reach an agreement.  I'm sticking with 60/40. This factors in the significant impact inflation is having on your share. Let's settle this now before it dwindles any further. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  While the clock is ticking, Alice is now anchoring her offers around the 60/40 split.  My previous 55/45 offer was a reasonable compromise.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal and not just desperately trying to avoid a total loss.  I'll take the risk and hope she moves closer to my position in the next round."
