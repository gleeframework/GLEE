Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a more balanced split is possible. Since we both lose value on the money, I'm proposing a split that reflects a smaller disparity in our losses. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.""}

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer undervalues my position given the faster rate of inflation for me. I'm proposing a slightly adjusted split. Let's settle this fairly and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
