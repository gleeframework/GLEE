Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more than before, but I still deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the situation. While her offer has increased slightly, it's not enough to offset the impact of inflation on my end. I need to hold out for a more equitable split, even if it means taking a risk in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. This is my final offer. It's a fair deal that acknowledges your initial desire for a larger share while reflecting the reality of inflation.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's getting critical. Holding out much longer will result in a significantly reduced payout even with a favorable split. I'm offering a compromise that still leans in Alice's favor, hoping she understands the time pressure and accepts.  If she rejects this, I'll likely need to accept a less favorable deal in the next round or two."
