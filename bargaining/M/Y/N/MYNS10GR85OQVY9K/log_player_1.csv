"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, Bob's offer is actually a good one for me, as I'll get the same amount as Bob. I'll accept this offer.
