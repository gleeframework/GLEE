"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leave Bob with 40 dollars. The message is a friendly reminder that I'm proposing a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is more fair, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's make this work! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my offer from Round 1 is now equivalent to 48 dollars (60 * 0.8).

Considering Bob's offer in Round 2, I'll have to decide whether to accept his 40 dollars or try to negotiate further.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again due to inflation, my offer from Round 1 is now equivalent to 38.4 dollars (48 * 0.8).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and make it 50-50!""
}
```

I'm now proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to find a mutually acceptable agreement."
