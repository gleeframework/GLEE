"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, but I'll take a bit more since I'm the first to propose.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity in the first round, Alice. But, I think a more even split is fairer, considering the money will be worth less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my $6,000 in the first round is now worth $4,800 in this round. And Bob's offer is that I get $4,000 and he gets $6,000. That's a good point about the money being worth less in the next round, but I'm not sure I want to give up the extra $800. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I need a bit more to make it worth my while, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500."
