Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm willing to give you a small amount to get the ball rolling. Hope you accept! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Alice's offer is generous, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that.  Let's be realistic here - I'm willing to give you a small amount to get things moving, but I need the majority of the money to make this worthwhile for me.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share for this to be worthwhile. Let's split it 60/40.  It's better than both of us getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While 60/40 is a better split than the previous rounds, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'm willing to wait a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my ideal split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm still hoping for a better split, but I'm also aware of the inflation.  Let's meet in the middle - 70/30 is a fair compromise, I think.  We can both benefit from this, and it's better than losing everything.""}
