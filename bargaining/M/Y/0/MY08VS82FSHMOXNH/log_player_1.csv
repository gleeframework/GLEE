"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 60-40 in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $300,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, which is $270,000.

I'm not too thrilled about this offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
