"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This is a relatively fair split, but I'm trying to be generous to see if Bob will accept it quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to flip the script!

I'll reject this offer since I was hoping for a more even split. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time for a counteroffer!

Here's my next proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's closer to the initial offer, but still a bit more in my favor."
