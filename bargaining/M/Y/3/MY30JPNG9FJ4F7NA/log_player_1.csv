"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I propose to keep 900,000$ for myself and give 100,000$ to Bob. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is better for me than the previous round, it's still not a fair division considering the potential for further inflation. I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose to keep 700,000$ and give 300,000$ to Bob.  With the inflation, I believe this is a fairer division than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a difficult decision, as I'm still losing value due to inflation. However, Bob's offer is the best I've seen so far, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  It's time to cut my losses and secure a decent portion of the money."
