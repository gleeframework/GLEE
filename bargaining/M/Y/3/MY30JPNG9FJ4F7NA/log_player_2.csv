"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Alice's offer was 100,000 for me and 900,000 for herself, I'll try to get a better deal.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I'd get are:

My gain: 300,000 / 0.64 (1 - 0.36) = 468,75
Alice's gain: 700,000 / 0.81 (1 - 0.19) = 863,64

Since Alice's offer is still quite skewed towards her, I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more balanced offer.

Since my gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a gain that's around 40% of the original 1,000,000.
