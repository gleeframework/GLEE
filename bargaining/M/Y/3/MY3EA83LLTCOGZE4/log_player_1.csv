"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a generous offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm offering Bob 50% of the initial $1,000,000, which seems like a fair split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a bigger share, I see.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to be careful. However, I still think this offer is a bit too skewed towards Bob.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent split. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable now. I'll accept this offer.
