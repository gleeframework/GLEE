I'm proposing a 999,999 to 1 split in my favor. I figure I'll be generous and give Bob at least a dollar to show I'm not a complete monster.  ðŸ˜‰ Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair.  It's better than getting nothing, and I'm sure Bob will be happy with it too."
