# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. I can try to get a better deal in the next round. Since there's inflation, I want to try to get more than half before the money loses value.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'll make a proposal for division. Here it is:\n\n# Bob's message: 60 for me, 40 for you. \n# Bob gain: 60 \n# Alice gain: 40 \n\nYour turn!"

Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the money is worth less now, I still think I can get a better deal than 45. Since Alice is willing to give me a little more, I'll try to negotiate further.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'll make another proposal for division. Here it is:\n\n# Bob's message: 58 for me, 42 for you. \n# Bob gain: 58 \n# Alice gain: 42 \n\nYour turn!"
