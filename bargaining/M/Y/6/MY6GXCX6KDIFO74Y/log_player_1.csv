"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since I'm getting 400,000, which is 80% of the original 500,000 I proposed in the first round, I'm not thrilled about it. However, it's still a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
