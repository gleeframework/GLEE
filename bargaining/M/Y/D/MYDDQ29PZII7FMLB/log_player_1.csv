"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and close the deal!""}\n\nI'm offering a slightly higher amount to myself, but still a relatively fair split, considering I'm the one making the first offer. I'm hoping Bob will see the benefit in accepting this deal and avoiding further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I think a more even split is reasonable given the risk of inflation. This offer is better for me than your previous offer even with the 5% decrease in value. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, as it gives him a larger share than my initial proposal. Considering the inflation, I'd rather take the risk and make another offer in the next round, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more generous offer than my first one. Let's close the deal before the money loses more value!""}\n\nI'm making a slightly more generous offer than my initial one, taking into account the 5% decrease in value due to inflation in each round. I'm hoping Bob will see the benefit in accepting this deal, as further rounds will only decrease the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time.  This is a very fair split considering the potential losses from inflation. Let's settle this now and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Although I initially hoped for a better deal, considering the inflation and the decreasing value of the money, I think this is a reasonable split. Further rounds would only lead to more losses for both of us, so it's time to settle the deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
