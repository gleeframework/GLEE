"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This way, we both get a significant amount of money, and I'm willing to give up a bit to make a good first impression."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I'll have to adjust my strategy considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Since the offer is the same as my initial offer, and I'm now getting less value for the same amount, I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent amount for myself and giving Bob a fair share, considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. Given the new offer, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money.

Since the offer is slightly more favorable to me than my previous offer, and I'm getting a better deal than in the previous round, I'll accept this offer.
