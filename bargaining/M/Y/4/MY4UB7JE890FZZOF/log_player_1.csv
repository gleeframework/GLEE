"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. In the first round, I would have gotten $600,000, but due to inflation, that's equivalent to $480,000 in the second round.

Bob's offer is $400,000, which is worth the same as in the first round, so it's equivalent to $400,000 in the second round.

Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully... I'll decide to reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation, my previous offer of $600,000 is now worth $480,000 in the third round. I'll aim to get a bit more this time, considering the decreased value of money. Here's my new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}"
