"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, Bob. Let's end this quickly and enjoy our winnings! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer. I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Plus, the money is still worth a lot, so I'm willing to take the risk of waiting another round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Come on, Alice! Let's be fair. I'm giving you a good deal considering the money is worth 20% less now.""}\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less now, I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself while still being somewhat reasonable. I'm hoping Alice will see the value in ending the game quickly before the money loses even more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob.  We've both lost money due to inflation, so let's call it a draw and end this game. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the money has lost 36% of its value since the first round, I think it's wise to accept Alice's offer and split the remaining amount evenly. Further negotiations might lead to even more loss due to inflation, so I'm willing to settle for this deal and cut my losses."
