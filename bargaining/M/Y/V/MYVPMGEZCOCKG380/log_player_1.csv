This is a tough situation. While accepting means I get significantly less than what I aimed for, rejecting means I risk getting even less next round. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, and Bob seems unwilling to budge. Accepting a 40/60 split now is better than potentially getting a worse deal later when the money is worth even less."
