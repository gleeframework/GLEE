# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With 20% inflation, I'd rather try to get a better deal than accept this initial offer. Let's see what happens next!"

{""bob_gain"": 420000,
""alice_gain"": 580000,

# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer as well. With the inflation, Alice's offer doesn't look as appealing, and I'd rather try to negotiate further.

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer. With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next rounds. Alice's offer seems reasonable, considering the circumstances.
{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm hoping that accepting this offer will ensure that I get a decent amount, even if it's not the best deal. The risk of losing more value in the next rounds is too high, so I'll settle for this."
