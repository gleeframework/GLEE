"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point considering I have the advantage of knowing the inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a better deal, accepting this offer ensures I get something. The inflation rate is significant, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
