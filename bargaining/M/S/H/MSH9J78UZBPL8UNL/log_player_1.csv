"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This is a very risky opening offer, but I think it's worth a shot.  It maximizes my gains while giving Bob a small incentive to potentially accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to get more, with inflation impacting my earnings, it's better to take the 5000 now.  Further rounds only increase the risk of getting nothing."
