Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to get a large portion of the money. It's risky, but it sets the stage for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation.  While I'm losing 20% of my potential gains, he's only losing 5%.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stick with a high offer for now. The inflation is working against me, but I think I can still get a good deal. I need to make a strong impression on Bob before he gets too comfortable with his inflated gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is getting increasingly difficult.  Inflation is hurting me more than Bob, and he's getting bolder with his offers. However, I'm still not satisfied with 20% of the money, even with the discounted value. I'll try to make a more reasonable offer in the next round, hoping to reach a compromise before the inflation completely wipes out my gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering an even split.  Inflation is hitting me hard, but I need to make a concession to avoid getting nothing at all. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a fair compromise and agree to it."
