"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is reasonable 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation makes it heavily skewed in her favor.  I need to push for a more advantageous split before the money loses too much value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but the inflation rate makes it difficult for me. How about a 65-35 split in my favor? This accounts for the devaluation with each round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll make a slight concession, but 58-42 is as far as I'll go for now 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is barely budging while the value decreases significantly each round. This offer isn't much better than her first. I need to hold firm and hope she becomes more reasonable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. The value of this deal is shrinking fast. I'm proposing 70-30. This is a serious offer considering the time constraint and inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the pressure, but I'm not ready to give up that much yet. 56-44 is my new proposal 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is finally moving in the right direction, but it's still not enough. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential gain, especially with the rapid devaluation. I need to hold my ground a little longer."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 680000,
""alice_gain"": 320000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  68-32 is my final offer. We're running out of time, and this is the best I can do considering the circumstances.""
