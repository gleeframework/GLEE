Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I'm worth more. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the numbers are:

My gain: $600,000 * 0.8 = $480,000

Bob's offer is:

Alice gain: $250,000
