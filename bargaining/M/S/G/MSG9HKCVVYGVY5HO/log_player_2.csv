This is a tough one, but at this point, accepting is the most logical choice. Here's why: 

* **Time Pressure:** We're down to the last few rounds. If we reject and don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing.
* **Diminishing Returns:** While Alice's offer isn't ideal, her share is becoming less valuable with each round due to the inflation. It's unlikely she'll agree to significantly less in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting carries the risk of getting a worse offer later or even timing out. Accepting guarantees Bob at least $480,000. 

It's a gamble either way, but accepting now minimizes the risk of walking away with nothing."
