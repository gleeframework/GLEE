"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money a bit closer to the middle.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my proposed gain in the second round would be 60% of 900,000 (since 1,000,000 * 0.9 = 900,000).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob's offer, as it's still a 55-45 split, which is closer to his favor than I'd like.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, my proposed gain in the third round would be 54% of 810,000 (since 900,000 * 0.9 = 810,000).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 438000,
  ""bob_gain"": 562000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's see if we can make a deal this round.""
