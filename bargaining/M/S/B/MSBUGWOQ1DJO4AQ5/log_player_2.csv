Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

While Alice is getting closer to my ideal split, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can improve my position."

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split the money evenly this time.  We're losing value each round, so I think we should both take what we can get.""}
