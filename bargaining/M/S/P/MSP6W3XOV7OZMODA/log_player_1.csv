"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but it still leaves some for Bob. I think it's a good starting point, given the inflation rates."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer. While it does give me a significant portion of the money, it's still less than what I was offered in the first round, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the first round, but it still leaves a decent amount for Bob. I'm trying to find a balance between maximizing my gains while also being reasonable to avoid further rejections."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is significantly better for Bob than his previous offer.  With inflation, I am losing more money than Bob with each passing round.  It's a good time to accept this offer."
