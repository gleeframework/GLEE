"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I propose a 50/50 split. This seems fair, and it avoids the risk of inflation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a 50/50 split, accepting this offer guarantees me $70, which is more than I would get if I reject and risk further inflation."
