"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large share, but still leaves Bob with something. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to compromise or wants to play it more aggressively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is a fair split and I don't want to risk losing more money due to inflation. It's better to take the guaranteed 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
