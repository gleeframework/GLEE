Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, and we both walk away with something substantial. Don't let greed cloud your judgement. 
# Alice gain: 180000 
# Bob gain: 820000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, which means our position is getting stronger.  He's also demonstrating that he values getting a deal done quickly.  I'm willing to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer.  It's clear you want to settle quickly, and this is a fair deal considering the time pressure. Don't let this opportunity slip away.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increased Offer:**  I'm increasing my offer to show some flexibility and entice Bob to accept. 
* **Finality:** By calling it my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to add weight to the decision and make Bob take it more seriously. 
* **Time Pressure:**  I'm reminding Bob of the time pressure and how each round diminishes the value of the money, especially for him."
