"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started with a higher offer, so I'll try to match your generosity, but with a slight bias towards myself 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I don't accept Bob's offer because it's still a 40-60 split, and I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'm willing to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair split.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think you're not serious about a fair split. I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I accept Bob's offer from round 4. Although it's not the best deal I could get, I think it's a reasonable compromise considering the situation. I'm willing to settle for a 45-55 split to avoid further negotiations and risk getting nothing if we don't divide the money soon."
