"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 60/40 is a more reasonable split. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: $6,000 / 0.9 = $6,667 (approximately)
Bob's gain: $4,000 / 0.8 = $5,000 (approximately)

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I'd be better off accepting this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
