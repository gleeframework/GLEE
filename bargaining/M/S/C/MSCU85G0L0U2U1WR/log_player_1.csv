Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic, Alice. This split reflects the fact that the value decreases for you faster with each round. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal considering the declining value. Let's settle this now before it gets any worse for you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take the $40 now, as the inflation will keep decreasing the value of my share with each passing round."
