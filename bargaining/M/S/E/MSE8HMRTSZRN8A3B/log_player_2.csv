"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good chunk of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  It's a good starting point, but I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I know the money is losing value each round, but I'm willing to risk it to see if I can get closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to divide the money, and we both get a good share.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need you to be realistic here. We both lose out with every round. This offer ensures I get a slightly larger share, reflecting the faster rate at which our money loses value. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. I understand that the money is losing value quickly, but I think we can still find a better deal for both of us. I'm not giving up on a 50/50 split just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise. This offer gives you a slightly larger share, but it's still a fair split considering the inflation. Let's end this before we lose even more money.""}
