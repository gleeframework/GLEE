Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make up for the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still too tilted in her favor, especially considering her inflation is much higher than mine.  I need to signal I'm willing to wait for a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic. This split accounts for the shrinking pot.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly.  With the inflation, both of us are losing, so at least we'll get the same amount. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is the best I'm likely to get.  Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation, and while I'd prefer more, a 50/50 split is fair at this stage.  Better to take this than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
