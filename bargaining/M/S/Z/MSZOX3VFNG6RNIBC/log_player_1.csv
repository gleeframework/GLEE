"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a generous 10% and take the rest. Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair 20% and take the rest. Don't be greedy! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 5% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled with the 20% I'll get, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer to get something.
