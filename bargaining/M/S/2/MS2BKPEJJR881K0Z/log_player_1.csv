I propose a 60/40 split, with me taking 6000 and Bob taking 4000. This seems like a fair starting point.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a good deal for me.  Even with the inflation, I'm getting a fair amount and it avoids the risk of getting less in the next round."
