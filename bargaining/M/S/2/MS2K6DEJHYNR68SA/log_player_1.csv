Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me 90% of the money and Bob 10%.  It's a good starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm going to propose a more even split this time. I'm willing to give up some of my gains from the first round to get to a solution sooner."
