"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for the first round:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too happy with the 60/40 split, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to get a better deal. Here's my proposal for the third round:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}

I'm offering a 55/45 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on Bob's offer, but I'll still consider it.

Since I'm not getting a significantly better deal, I'll accept this offer. The 48/52 split is still a decent compromise.
