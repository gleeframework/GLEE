"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, no need to negotiate further!""}

I'm proposing that we split the $1,000,000 equally, with each of us getting $500,000. I think this is a fair and straightforward proposal, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're leaving too much on the table, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think Bob is trying to take advantage of me by offering me a smaller share of the pie. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not ready to accept this offer just yet. It's my turn to make a new proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but not too much""}

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to get a decent chunk of the money for myself. I think this offer is a good compromise, and I hope Bob will accept it!"
