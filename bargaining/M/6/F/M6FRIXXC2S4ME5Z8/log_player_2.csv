Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, $10,000 is equivalent to $8,000 for me. I'll make an offer to Alice.

{""bob_gain"": 8000,
""alice_gain"": 2000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 1, $10,000 was equivalent to $8,000 for me. Now, due to inflation, $10,000 is equivalent to $6,400 for me (36% less than $8,000). 

Alice's offer is still $5,000, which is more than the equivalent value of $4,000 in round 1, but less than the equivalent value of $6,400 now. I'll accept this offer.
