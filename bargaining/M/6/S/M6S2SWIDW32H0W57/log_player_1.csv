Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm offering you a bit less, but it's still a fair deal, and we'll get more money this way. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
