"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, with a message inviting him to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still holding out for a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is losing value, so I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 40% share. I'll wait for a better proposal from him."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still keeping the majority of the money. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up much more. Let's see if you'll take it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation eating away at the value of the money, I need to be more careful with my decisions.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. A 50-50 split is fair, and I'd rather take a guaranteed half of the remaining money than risk losing more value in future rounds."
