"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 90% and you get 10%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, with me getting the larger share. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he declines!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's a good starting point, and I'm open to discussion if you have a different idea. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is now worth 5% less, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Considering Bob's proposal, I think I can do better than a 50/50 split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure 50/50 is the best I can get. I'll think of a new proposal""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the 5% decrease in the value of my gain due to inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the loss. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 70% this time, it's a bit more aggressive, but I need to make up for the inflation""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair given the inflation.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to make sure I get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain even more severely, I'll have to be more cautious. Considering Bob's proposal, I think a 60/40 split is actually quite generous given the circumstances. I'll take it, but I'll make sure to communicate my reasoning to Bob:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll accept the 60/40 split. I think it's a fair deal considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money. I'm glad we could come to an agreement!""
}
```"
