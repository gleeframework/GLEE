"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, I'll take the bigger share this time, but you'll get a chance to propose in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to accept a small gain, rejecting allows Bob to make the proposal in the next round, giving him more control over the division. With inflation, waiting can be beneficial."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
