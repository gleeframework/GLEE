Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering you 40 dollars, which is a generous share, considering we're just starting out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'd like to get a better share. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
