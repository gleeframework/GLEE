"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 40% of the money, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly higher share, but I'm not going all the way to 50/50 yet. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll take a slightly higher share, but I'll try to negotiate further. My response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get closer to 50/50, but I'm willing to compromise. Can you meet me at 45/55?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me at 45/55, which is a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 90% of its original value due to inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to accept 45% and let you take the rest. I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm sticking with the 45/55 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
