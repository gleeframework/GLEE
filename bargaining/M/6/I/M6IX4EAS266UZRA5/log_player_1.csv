"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, offering to split the $10,000 equally between us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take the majority 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 2/3 of the money, even if it's worth 10% less for Bob. I'll try to negotiate further!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I'm not going to give up too much. You can have 40% and I'll take 60%""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a decent share and keeping a larger portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse!

After considering Bob's new offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up more than 45% of the original amount. I think I can do better than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up more than 45% of the original amount. This is my final offer""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise that's close to the middle ground, while still keeping a slight edge for myself."
