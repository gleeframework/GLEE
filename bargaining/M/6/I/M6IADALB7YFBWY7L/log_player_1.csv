"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual values are:

Alice gain: 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000
Bob gain: 700,000 * 0.9 = 630,000

I'll reject this offer. The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is too low, and I'm hoping to do better in the next round. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the second round, the actual value is 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.81 of the original value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 510,000$ and keeping 490,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, the actual value is 1 - 0.271 = 0.729 of the original value.

The actual values are:

Alice gain: 450,000 * 0.729 = 327,450
Bob gain: 550,000 * 0.729 = 400,350

I'll accept this offer. The ratio of my gain to Bob's gain is reasonable, and I'm not expecting to do better in the next round.
