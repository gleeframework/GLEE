"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the 100$ and Bob gets 20%. This is a fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I'm now considering a proposal where I get 40% of the original 100$, which is worth 32$ in today's money.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
