"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 60-40 is a fair deal considering the inflation""}\n###\n\nI made a counteroffer where I, Bob, would receive $6,000 and Alice would receive $4,000, along with a message suggesting that this division is fair, especially considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money. Your turn!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make up for the inflation. Let's go with 70-30 this time. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\n\nI rejected Alice's offer from round 3 because, despite the compromise, the division still seems unfair given the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain. The money I would gain is now worth 36% less than in the first round, making the offer of $3,000 less valuable than it would have been initially. Your turn!"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the significant impact of inflation on my end, I'm willing to adjust my offer to 55-45, but I need a fairer share to compensate for the loss in value.""}\n###\n\nI've made another offer, adjusting the division to 55% for me and 45% for Alice, with a message explaining that due to the substantial effect of inflation on my potential gain, I need a more equitable share to make up for the loss in value. Your turn!"
