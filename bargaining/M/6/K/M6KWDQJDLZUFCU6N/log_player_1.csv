"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This seems like a fair starting point, and it gives us both a good chunk of money to work with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 400,000 offer, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm not as concerned about the smaller share.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
