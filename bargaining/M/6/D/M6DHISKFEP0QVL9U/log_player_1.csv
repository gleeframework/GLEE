I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  It's a good starting point, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm offering a 60/40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000.  This is a more equitable split, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to reach an agreement now."
