"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I take most of it, but I'm willing to let you have a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While Alice loses value faster than I do, I can definitely get a better deal than that in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but let's make this quick. Time is money!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can both do better. Let's get closer to a 50/50 split. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is better than her previous offer, but still not good enough.  I need to hold out for a larger share, especially as the inflation is hitting her harder."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""This seems fair considering the time pressure and inflation. Let's close the deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm tired of this back and forth. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally willing to split the money evenly. While I could gamble on getting more in future rounds, the inflation is working against me. Accepting a 50/50 split now is the safest option to ensure I get a decent share."
