900000.0,100000.0,I propose a fair split. You get 10% and I get 90%. Let's end this quickly!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
700000.0,300000.0,"I think 30% for me is more reasonable, considering the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
850000.0,150000.0,"Let's meet in the middle. I'm reducing my share by 5%, but I still believe this is a fair offer, given the inflation.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"I'm increasing my share to 40%. With inflation, the money is worth less each round, so I think this is a fair offer.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
750000.0,250000.0,I'm willing to go down to 75% to get this over with.  Let's agree on this before the inflation gets worse for both of us.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I'm increasing my share to 55%. With the rapidly decreasing value of money for me, I think I deserve a bigger share. Let's end this before it's worthless for me.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
650000.0,350000.0,I'm willing to go down to 65% to try to reach an agreement. We're both losing a lot with each round. Let's end this quickly and at least secure some value.,Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"At this point, with the extreme inflation devaluing my share, I need a significantly larger portion to make it worthwhile. Let's end this before it's too late for me.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"This is my final offer. I'm willing to go down to 55% but I won't go any lower. With each round, we're losing more and more. Let's end this and secure some value before it's too late.",Alice,9,
