"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 20% and take the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and I'll take the remaining $80. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want to keep some for myself. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $70 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $63.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but it's a better deal than the first one. I'll consider it. Since I'm not sure what the inflation rate is for Bob, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential for a better deal in the next round.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
