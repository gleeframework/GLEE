Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right about time, Alice.  Let's settle this now with a win-win deal. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting increasingly impatient, but his offers are still heavily skewed in his favor.  While the value of the money is decreasing, it's important not to panic and accept a bad deal.  There's still time to negotiate a fairer outcome."
