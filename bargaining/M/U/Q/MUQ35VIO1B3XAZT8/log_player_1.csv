I propose you take $9,000 and Bob takes $1,000.  I figure this is a fair starting point, given the inflation penalty is higher for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still aiming for a higher share, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to avoid further inflation."
