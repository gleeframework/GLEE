Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a larger share, but I need a fair deal too. This offer is a compromise, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation to some extent, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The longer this goes on, the more our potential gains shrink. However, Alice's gains are shrinking much faster. By round 5, her $6000 offer from Round 1 will be worth less than my current offer. It's time to push for a more significant shift in my favor, gambling on her fear of losing everything."
