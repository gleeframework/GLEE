"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I propose a division that slightly favors me to ensure stability over the rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5238.1 
# Bob gain: 4761.9 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
