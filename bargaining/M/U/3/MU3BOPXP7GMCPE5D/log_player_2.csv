"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. You get 10% and I get 90%. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm Bob, and 10% is far too low.  I'll see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split.  It's a fair compromise considering the inflation we're facing.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but 65/35 is the best I can do. We both have to account for the inflation, and this split is more fair than the 60/40 you offered. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a higher share,  the inflation is really biting into my potential gains.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best way to ensure I get something substantial."
