"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is a bit more fair, considering the value of the money will decrease with each round. Let's be efficient and get this done! 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 65-35 split, but I understand Bob's point about the decreasing value of money. I'll accept his offer for now.
