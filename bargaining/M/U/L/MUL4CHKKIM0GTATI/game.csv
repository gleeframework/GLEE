350000.0,650000.0,"I think we can do better than 60-40.  How about a 65-35 split?  We both get a decent amount, and we can move on to more important things.",Bob,2,

550000.0,450000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, 55-45 is a fair split considering the inflation.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Let's split the difference from the last round.  A 60-40 split in my favor is fair given the inflation, and it gives us both a good amount to work with.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
580000.0,420000.0,"Considering the increasing inflation, I think 58-42 is a generous offer. Take it before the money loses more value!",Alice,5,

400000.0,600000.0,"We're getting close to the end, and the inflation is only going to get worse.  Let's stick with the 60-40 split we talked about earlier. It's the most fair way to divide the money given the current circumstances.",Bob,6,

450000.0,550000.0,"We're running out of time, and I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55-45. It's a fair deal considering the inflation, and we can both walk away with a decent amount.",Bob,8,

500000.0,500000.0,"With only a few rounds left, the inflation is hurting both of us. Let's split the money evenly and call it a day. It's the most reasonable solution at this point.",Bob,10,

680000.0,320000.0,"I'm not going to give up my advantage now. With only two rounds left, you should take what you can get. This is my final serious offer.",Alice,11,
