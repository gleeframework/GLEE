"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 400000,
  ""bob_gain"": 600000
}
```

This way, I'll get 40% and Bob will get 60%. It's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me, I'll get 300,000 * 0.9 = 270,000. And Bob will get 700,000 * 0.8 = 560,000.

It's still a relatively close split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a slightly more favorable split. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000
}
```

This way, I'll get 32% and Bob will get 68%. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
