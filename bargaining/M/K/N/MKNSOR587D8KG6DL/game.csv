5800.0,4200.0,"Let's be rational, Bob. Considering the inflation rates, this split ensures we both get a fair share after a few rounds. If we delay, we both lose value, but you lose more. Accept this offer and we both win.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I understand your logic, Alice. But considering the inflation affects me more, I think a 60/40 split is more fair. This ensures both of us maximize our gains despite the inflation. Let's get this done quickly and avoid further losses.",Bob,2,

6100.0,3900.0,"Bob, you're right about the impact of inflation, but your offer doesn't quite balance the scale for me. Given that each round costs me less than it costs you, I'm willing to be a bit more generous than before, but I still need to prioritize my gains. This offer is closer to reflecting the actual value we both stand to lose with each passing round. Let's not drag this out further.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, it seems like we're both feeling the pinch of inflation. Let's agree on a 50/50 split and end this game. We both lose a lot of value if we keep going. This is the most logical way to maximize our gains and minimize our losses. Let's call it a draw.",Bob,4,
