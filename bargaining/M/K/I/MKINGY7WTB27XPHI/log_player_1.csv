"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate, let's get this over with!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $1,000,000 evenly between us, so we both get $500,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think you can do better 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the 10% decrease in the value of the money I'll gain.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it. Since I'll gain $400,000, but it's worth 10% less than the original $500,000 I offered, I'll be getting $400,000 / 0.9 = $444,444.44 in effective value.

In comparison, Bob's offer is $600,000, but I don't know how much it's worth to him. I'll have to consider the fact that his gain is worth 20% less than the original $500,000, but I don't know the exact conversion rate.

Given the uncertainty, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In the third round, the money I'll gain is worth 10% less than in the second round, so I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

Considering the inflation, I'll offer a slightly lower amount to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting any younger, let's wrap this up!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I'm getting the better end of this deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is biting hard! In the fourth round, I'll have to adjust my expectations even further.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the effective value of the money I'll gain. Since I'll get $300,000, but it's worth 27.1% less than the original $500,000 I offered, I'll be getting $300,000 / 0.713 = $420,000 in effective value.

However, I don't know how much Bob's gain is worth to him, since it's worth 48.8% less than the original $500,000. But I can see that he's offering me a lower amount, and I'm getting a lower effective value than in the previous round.

I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or reject it and try to negotiate further.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value! In the fifth round, I'll have to make an even more aggressive offer to Bob.

Considering the 27.1% decrease in the value of the money I'll gain, I'll offer a smaller amount to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 380000,
  ""bob_gain"": 620000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still want to be fair, let's meet in the middle!""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 250k, but I'm starting to think I'm being too generous 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money! In the sixth round, I'll have to make a tough decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the effective value of the money I'll gain. Since I'll get $250,000, but it's worth 40.95% less than the original $500,000 I offered, I'll be getting $250,000 / 0.5915 = $422,000 in effective value.

However, I don't know how much Bob's gain is worth to him, since it's worth 67.23% less than the original $500,000. But I can see that he's offering me a significantly lower amount, and I'm getting a lower effective value than in the previous round.

Given the steep decline in the value of the money, I'm starting to get worried that I might not be able to get a good deal. However, I still have 6 rounds left, and I don't want to give up yet.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really taking its toll on the money's value! In the seventh round, I'll have to make a very aggressive offer to Bob.

Considering the 40.95% decrease in the value of the money I'll gain, I'll offer an even smaller amount to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of time, I need a deal, let's make it happen!""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 200k, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really ravaging the value of the money! In the eighth round, I'll have to make a very tough decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the effective value of the money I'll gain. Since I'll get $200,000, but it's worth 52.17% less than the original $500,000 I offered, I'll be getting $200,000 / 0.4747 = $421,000 in effective value.

However, I don't know how much Bob's gain is worth to him, since it's worth 79.03% less than the original $500,000. But I can see that he's offering me a significantly lower amount, and I'm getting a lower effective value than in the previous round.

Given the extremely low value of the money, I'm starting to think that I should accept this offer. I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting a smaller amount now against the risk of waiting for a better offer that might not come.

I'll accept the offer.
