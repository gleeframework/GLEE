"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if he's willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant shift in the balance of power. While I'm losing a substantial amount, I believe it's in my best interest to keep playing. There's a good chance I can secure a better deal later on, especially since his money is losing value at a slower rate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to Bob, but still keeping a significant portion for myself. It's a risky move, but I'm hoping that he'll realize that continuing to reject offers will lead to both of us getting less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to push for a more favorable deal, but his offer is still too lopsided.  I'm willing to take the risk of continuing and see if I can get a better outcome. Even though the value of my money is diminishing rapidly, the possibility of getting a larger share later still outweighs the potential loss."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm keeping the offer close to the previous round, hoping to send a message that I'm not giving up easily. This is still a significant portion of the money for Bob, and I believe he'll be tempted to accept it, especially considering the rapid depreciation of his potential gains."
