"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 10$ for me, I'll try to do better. Given the 20% inflation, I'll offer a slightly higher amount to make up for it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing. Alice's offer is still relatively high, but I'll think about it.

I'll accept this offer, since it's a good opportunity to get something rather than risking further inflation.
