"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my first offer, Alice.  I am aiming for the most money possible, knowing that Bob has to accept to get anything at all. However,  I am offering him a small amount to avoid him becoming overly antagonistic.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm taking the 500,000.  It's better than getting 999,999, but worth 5% less.  Bob knows he's got the upper hand here, so I'm taking what I can get!"
