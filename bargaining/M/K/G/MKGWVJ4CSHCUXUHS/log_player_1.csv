I'm offering Bob a small share to start, hoping he'll accept it. I'm not sure how he'll react to the inflation, so I'm trying to get the most for myself while still being fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's better for me to take a chance and try to get a better deal in the next round.  Although the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm still hoping to get a larger share. I'll have to be careful, though, as Bob knows I'm feeling the effects of inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to try and incentivize Bob to accept. The inflation is starting to take its toll, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money. I'll need to be more cautious in the coming rounds, as Bob might be more willing to hold out for a larger portion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly feeling the effects of inflation, too. While his offer is much better than in the previous round, I'm still holding out for a larger share.  I know the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. The next few rounds will be critical, and I need to find a balance between accepting a fair offer and risking getting nothing at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly again, but keeping it below what Bob offered in the previous round.  I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and motivating Bob to accept. Inflation is a big factor here, but I'm still aiming for a significant amount of money. This round will be crucial for determining the future direction of the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With the inflation hitting so hard, I need to accept this offer. While I'm not getting the share I initially hoped for,  it's still a significant amount of money and better than risking getting nothing at all.  The potential loss from further rounds due to inflation is too great a risk. It's time to be realistic and secure some money."
