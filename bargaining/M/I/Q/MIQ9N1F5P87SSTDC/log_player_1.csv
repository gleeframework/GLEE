"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we both have to account for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, considering I was the one who made the initial offer and Bob rejected it. I think a 60/40 split is too skewed in Bob's favor.

I'll reject this offer and make a new one.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more due to the initial offer I made.""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but still takes into account the effects of inflation."
