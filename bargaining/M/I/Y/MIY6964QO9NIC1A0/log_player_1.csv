"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the initial amount. This is a relatively high offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can conclude the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm taking the majority this time, but we can still end it here. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already taken a bite out of my potential gain. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because, although it's a significant amount, I'm not convinced it's fair, especially considering the inflation. I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking its toll, and my potential gain is now worth 64% of what it was initially. I'll have to be more strategic with my next offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're taking a big share, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a more modest amount, but still a significant portion of the remaining money. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game."
