"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous in round 1, now it's my turn to be generous, but not that generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject this offer. It's a significant drop from my initial proposal, and I'm still hopeful we can find a more equitable split, even with inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, Alice. I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I understand the need for compromise, accepting this would leave me with a significantly smaller share than I initially proposed. I believe we can still find a better solution before the inflation cuts into our gains too much."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Bob, we're running out of time! We need to find a solution that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my share again, but I need to see a bit more flexibility from your side.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, Alice. I'll give you a tiny share, but I'm taking most of the money. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer. While I understand the pressure of the diminishing value of the money, accepting this deal would be incredibly unfair. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a one-sided arrangement."
