Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly. We both get a fair share, and we don't have to deal with inflation eroding our gains.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want an even split, but the longer this goes on, the less your share is actually worth. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for me than last round to account for the ongoing inflation. Let's settle this now and both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 4875 
# Alice gain: 5125
