"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, which I believe is a reasonable and fair division of the money. I'm open to negotiations, but I think this is a good starting point. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nWhile a 50-50 split might seem fair at first glance, considering the inflation rates, I think I can get a better deal. The fact that the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob in each subsequent round means that I have more bargaining power as the rounds progress. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better deal for you""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the inflation rates, the money is worth less to both of us, but significantly less to Bob. I'll increase my share to 65% and offer Bob 35%. This way, I'm taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us, while still trying to find a mutually acceptable agreement. Let's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems reasonable, I still think I can negotiate a better deal. The inflation rates are affecting Bob's share more significantly, and I believe he'll be more willing to compromise as the rounds progress. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round, trying to take advantage of the increasing pressure on Bob due to the decreasing value of his potential gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you harder, let's settle on this""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's potential gain, I'll increase my share to 70% and offer Bob 30%. The decreasing value of the money is putting more pressure on Bob, and I believe he'll be more inclined to accept a deal that gives him a smaller share rather than risking further devaluation. This offer still gives Bob a substantial amount, but also reflects the changing circumstances due to inflation. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  Let's call it a day with this split. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Bob, I think this offer is reasonable. At this point, the money is worth 22.62% less for me and 67.23% less for Bob compared to the first round. Accepting this offer ensures that I get a substantial amount, and further negotiations may lead to a less favorable outcome due to the decreasing value of the money. It's time to conclude the game and secure my gain."
