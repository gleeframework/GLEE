"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my first offer. I propose we split the money 6000 for me and 4000 for you. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm going to try and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'm offering you 4500, and I'll take 5500.  Let's get this done quickly.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've decided to propose an equal split since Bob rejected my previous offer. This way, we both get $5000. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a bigger share, an equal split is a fair outcome considering the inflation and risk of getting nothing."
