**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to a more even split, time is running out.  It's crucial to push for a stronger position while her potential gains are diminishing quickly due to the higher inflation rate she faces."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  Take it now, or the deal will only get worse for both of us as inflation increases.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a strategic balance between firmness and a slight concession. 

* **Firmness:**  Alice needs to understand time is running out and her position weakens significantly with each round.
* **Slight Concession:** By offering slightly less than the previous round, it shows a willingness to negotiate and might be enough to get Alice to agree. 

The message also conveys a sense of urgency, reminding Alice that delay only hurts both of them."
