"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is 40% of the original $100. I'm hoping he'll accept this reasonable proposal and we can end the game here."
