"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, keeping $900,000 for myself and giving Bob $100,000.  This gives Bob a small amount, but it's better than nothing and it sets up a fair starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I propose a 45/55 split.  Since we both rejected the previous offers, I think a more even split is necessary to come to an agreement. This split still favors Bob slightly, but it's a significant step towards a more equitable division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is still less than ideal, the inflation is starting to take a toll on the potential gains.  Accepting this offer means I'll still get a decent amount of money, and any further rounds might result in a significantly lower share for me."
