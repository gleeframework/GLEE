 I'm going for a greedy strategy first. I'll take the majority of the money and see what Bob does.  If he rejects,  we'll see how the inflation affects his decisions in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's in my best interest to accept this offer. While I get less than I initially wanted, the inflation is likely to affect Bob's offers in future rounds, making it less likely I'll get a better deal.  50/50 is a fair split considering the inflation factor."
