{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can both be happy with this""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I would get 60 dollars and Bob would get 40 dollars. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that, but I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I'm willing to consider it since Bob is trying to meet me halfway.
