"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""I'll take all the money, deal?""
}
```

This is a straightforward offer, but I'm sure Bob will reject it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we divide the money 4:1 in favor of Alice, considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of money, I think Bob's offer is reasonable. I'll accept it.
