"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This is a relatively balanced offer, but I'm hoping Bob will think it's a good starting point and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take the majority of the money in the second round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob was trying to take the majority of the money in the previous round, I'll try to counter with a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal for round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make a more extreme offer in the fourth round. I'll reject this offer again, as I'd like to get a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offers are getting more extreme, I'll try to make a more moderate offer. Here's my proposal for round 5:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

This is a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable offer."
