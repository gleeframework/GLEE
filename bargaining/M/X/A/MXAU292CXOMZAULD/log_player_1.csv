"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a larger share initially. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's start with a fair split 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In this round, I would gain $50, but since it's worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll actually receive $47.50.

Here's my response:

```
{

In this round, I would gain $45, but since it's worth 14.26% less than the original $60, I'll actually receive $51.60.
