Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to do this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer for a favorable outcome for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out. Let's find a middle ground. This offer is closer to a 50/50 split than yours, and we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, time is working against him far more than me.  His share is losing value much faster. I'll hold out for a slightly better offer, as rejecting this keeps the pressure on Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm being realistic. Take this deal before inflation eats away at your share even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  I'm applying more pressure by slightly lowering my demand, but still keeping it favorable for myself. Bob needs to understand that time is his enemy. 
* **Inflation Advantage:** His 48.8% loss after 4 rounds is significant.  He should be getting desperate for a deal soon. 
* **Future Leverage:** If he rejects this, I'm in a strong position to demand even more in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with each round. Let's try to find a compromise. This offer gives you more, but at least we both get something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Sensitivity:**  While still in a good position, my gains are being affected by inflation too. Accepting now guarantees a good amount.
* **Shift in Bob's Strategy:** Bob offering 6000 suggests a change in his thinking. He's finally recognizing the impact of inflation on his share.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more might backfire.  Bob could become desperate and offer much less in later rounds, or we might not reach an agreement at all."
