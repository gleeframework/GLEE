"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money to start with, and we can negotiate further in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure 60% is fair, Alice. How about we split it a bit more in my favor? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob is being very generous.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal for Round 3. Since the money is worth 10% less for me due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher percentage to make up for it.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, Bob. Let's see if you'll take it this time.""
}
```"
