"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining 60%, which is $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my calculation. In this round, I'll gain $45, which is worth 80% of the original $60 I proposed in the first round. 

I'll accept Bob's offer.
