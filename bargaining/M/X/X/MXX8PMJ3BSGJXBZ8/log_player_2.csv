"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split close to even, but slightly in my favor since I'm making the first move.  This ensures we both benefit from acting sooner rather than later. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Given the 5% inflation, accepting my offer now will benefit us both more than waiting for further rounds.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains. Let's stop wasting time with negotiations and split this evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both lose less to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation and the fairness of a 50/50 split, I accept Alice's offer to minimize further loss."
