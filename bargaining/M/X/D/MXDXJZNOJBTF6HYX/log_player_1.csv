I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems like a reasonable starting point, given I'm the one making the first offer. I figure I can take advantage of the inflation to my benefit if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is terrible!  Even though I lose money due to inflation, it's not worth taking such a small portion. I'll counter with a much more balanced offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm offering a 45/55 split in my favor.  This is still significantly more than Bob offered, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid going further into the game and risking losing even more to inflation."
