"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to accept""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, I'll give you a fair chance to accept 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll receive 56 dollars if I accept this offer.

I think this is a reasonable offer, and meeting in the middle is a fair compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
