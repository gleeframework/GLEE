"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Let's see if I can get a better deal.  I'll take the risk and see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split.  Let's make a deal and avoid further inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me halfway! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a bigger share, the inflation is really eating into my potential gains.  Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting and the inflation continues."
