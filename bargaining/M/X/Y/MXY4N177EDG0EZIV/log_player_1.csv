Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

This is my initial offer.  I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I want to maximize my share of the money.  However, I am aware that if Bob rejects this offer, he will have the power to propose in the next round, and the value of the money will decrease for me.  I'll be watching carefully to see if he accepts my offer, or if he wants to play it out longer."
