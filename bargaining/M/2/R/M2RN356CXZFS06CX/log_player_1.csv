"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 6:4 split in my favor. This is more fair as the money is worth less for you after each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
