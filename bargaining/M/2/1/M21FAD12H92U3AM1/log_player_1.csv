Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time. Let's close the deal! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

Now it's my turn again. I'll make a new proposal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 537500, ""bob_gain"": 462500, ""message"": ""Compromising a bit more!""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money, Alice! This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### 

I'll stop here since I've accepted the offer.

Let's review the game:

Round 1: I offered a 60-40 split, which Bob rejected.
Round 2: Bob offered a 45-55 split, which I rejected.
Round 3: I offered a 53.75-46.25 split (after inflation adjustment), which Bob rejected.
Round 4: Bob offered a 47.5-52.5 split, which I accepted.

The game ended with Bob's offer in Round 4, and I accepted a gain of $475,000, which is worth 14.26% less than the initial value due to inflation."
