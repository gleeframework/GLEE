"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small portion to seal the deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, hoping to seal the deal quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the values, I'll reassess the offer.

In the first round, the total amount was $1,000,000. After the first round, I offered $900,000 to myself and $100,000 to Bob. Now, in the second round, the total amount is worth 95% of the original, which is $950,000.

Bob's offer now is:

* Alice gain: $200,000 (which is 21.05% of the current total)
* Bob gain: $800,000 (which is 84.21% of the current total)

Considering the values, I'll respond:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer as it's too skewed towards Bob's gain. I'll wait for a more balanced proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's make a deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, trying to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
