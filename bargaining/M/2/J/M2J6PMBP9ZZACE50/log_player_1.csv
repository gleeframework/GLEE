"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, keeping 99% of the money for myself. It's a risky move, but if Bob rejects, the money will be worth less for him in the next round, giving me a better chance of getting a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like to hold out for more, I'm aware of the inflation risk. Bob's offer is a fair split, and if I reject it, there's no guarantee he'll be as generous in the future. Accepting this ensures I get something."
