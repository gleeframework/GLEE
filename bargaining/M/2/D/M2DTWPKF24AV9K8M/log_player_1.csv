"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. This way we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'm still getting $3,000, but for Bob, his $7,000 is worth 5% less than his original proposal of $4,000.

I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more, considering the value of the money is decreasing for Bob.

I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much. This way we both get a decent amount.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, with me getting $4,200 and Bob getting $5,800."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts Bob is offering:

Since the money is worth 5% less for Bob in Round 2, and another 9.26% less in Round 4, the total discount is 14.26%. 

The original $4,000 Bob offered in Round 2 would be worth $4,000 * 0.8554 = $3,421.60 in Round 4.

So, Bob's offer of $5,500 in Round 4 is actually worth $5,500 / 0.8554 = $6,443.19 in Round 2 terms, and $4,000 in Round 1 terms.

I'm not sure if I want to give up that much more, considering the value of the money is decreasing for Bob.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. This way we both get an equal share.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, with me getting $5,000 and Bob getting $5,000."
