"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm not going to accept getting only 100,000 out of a million!  Let's see what kind of offer I can get."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I think this is a fair starting point, given the inflation. Let's work from here.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
This offer is much better than the first one, and it's getting late in the game. I'd rather take 400,000 now than risk getting nothing."
