"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but we can negotiate further if you think it's too much. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I can try to negotiate for a better share without worrying about the inflation penalty. Let's see how the game unfolds!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and share the wealth more equally.""}\n\n###\n\nSince Alice's initial offer gave her the lion's share, I'll propose a division that brings the shares closer to equal, while still acknowledging that she might want a bit more. This way, we can negotiate further without starting from an extreme position. The message aims to convey a sense of fairness and cooperation, encouraging Alice to consider this offer or make a reasonable counteroffer."
