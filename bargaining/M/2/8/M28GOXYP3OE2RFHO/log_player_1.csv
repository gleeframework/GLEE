"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's split it a bit more evenly, but time is money - literally. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand time is money, but so is fairness. This is a slight improvement on your offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting us nowhere. Let's just split it down the middle and call it a day. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking further rounds of negotiation and losing more money to inflation.  It's clear Bob is getting impatient, and a fair deal now is preferable to a worse deal or no deal later."
