Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 7000,

}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000 and keeping $7,000 for myself."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer. The money is becoming less valuable, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.
