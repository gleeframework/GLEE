I'm starting with a fair offer. I want to get a good portion of the money, but I'm not being greedy. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting greedy!  I'm not going to accept a worse offer than my own.  I'll make a better proposal next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to increase my share slightly to make it more appealing. Bob will need to decide if he wants to keep pushing for more or settle for a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Okay, Bob's getting desperate. I'll accept this even though I get slightly less than my original offer. I'm not sure how much longer we can keep this up."
