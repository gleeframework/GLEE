Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is a fair deal, considering the inflation rate will hit me harder than you. Let's agree on this and get the money divided before it loses too much value. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
