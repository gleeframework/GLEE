I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure I'll need to give Bob something to get him to accept, but I want to maximize my share since the money is worth less each round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. It's true that the money is worth less with each round, but I can still get a much better deal by holding out. I'm confident that I can get a better split in the next round.  I'll make a counter-offer that's closer to a 50/50 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going for a 55/45 split in my favor this time.  I'm willing to give up some of my potential gains to try and reach an agreement before the inflation eats away too much of our money.  I think this is a fair compromise, and Bob might be more likely to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While the money is worth less with each round, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. Bob's offer is too far off from a 50/50 split, and I'm hoping to get closer to that in the next round. I'll make another counter-offer and try to bridge the gap."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split this time.  The inflation is starting to hit hard, and I'm worried we'll both end up with nothing if we keep rejecting each other's offers. I think this is a fair compromise, and Bob might be more likely to accept it since he's getting a better deal than he's offered so far."
