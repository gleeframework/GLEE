Alice's offer:

This is a pretty bad offer for Bob in the first round.  While it's tempting to take something, the inflation means that even a small amount of money will be worth much less in the later rounds. It's worth risking a few rounds to see if Alice will offer a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
``` 
 
I'm proposing a 900,000 / 100,000 split in my favor. It's a risky move, but I believe Alice will be more willing to accept a deal in the second round, as she's not guaranteed to have the advantage going forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is much better than the first round, it's still not great considering the inflation. Since it's still early in the game, it's worth continuing to try and negotiate a more favorable split. I'm hoping Alice will realize that the inflation will eventually hurt her too, and she'll be more willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 600,000 / 400,000 split in my favor.  This is a more balanced offer than my previous proposal, and it's still a good deal considering the inflation. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a fair compromise and accept it to avoid the risk of further inflation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the inflation.  While I'd prefer a higher share, continuing to reject offers risks getting nothing at all, especially with the inflation rate increasing. It's time to accept this offer and secure half of the remaining money."
