"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he deserves more, huh?

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a 80% share, which is quite a significant difference from the 50/50 split I initially proposed.

I'll reject this offer and hope to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 80% and I rejected it, I'll try to counter with a new offer that's more favorable to me. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share for myself.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit less, but I think I deserve more, considering the inflation!""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns!

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually a 60% share, which is still quite a bit more than the 50% I initially proposed. However, I'm willing to compromise to avoid further negotiations.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
