I'm offering to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared for him to counter.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Even with inflation, this is a better deal for me than what I could get if I reject and try to negotiate again. I'm not sure how much the inflation is affecting Bob, but he seems to be willing to split the money evenly now."
