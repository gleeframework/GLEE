"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, I'm the one making the first offer!""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $10,000, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair split, no need to negotiate too much 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after the first round, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a good one. I'll accept it.
