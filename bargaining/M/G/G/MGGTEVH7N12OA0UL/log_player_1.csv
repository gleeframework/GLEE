"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60-40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the inflation disadvantage you face. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a chance!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split in Bob's favor, especially considering the initial offer was already in my favor. I think I can do better than that!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation disadvantage I face.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to give up more than 45% of the total."
