Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and inflation is killing your share. This is a good deal for you, considering.

# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice, even though it's far from ideal. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 3 rounds left, the risk of getting $0 is very high if Bob continues to reject Alice's offers.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  The inflation is severely eating into Bob's potential gains. Accepting $4,500 now is better than holding out for a potentially slightly larger sum that's worth significantly less due to inflation.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice is clearly aware of her advantageous position and is unlikely to offer anything significantly better. 

While not ideal, taking $4,500 is better than risking a complete loss.
