"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money with a slight advantage for me, Bob. A deal now is better than less money later! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd rather take my chances and propose a more favorable split in the next round, despite the risk of inflation reducing the overall value."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, but we both still get a good share before the money devalues further.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we're both aiming for a good deal. Let's split it evenly and not risk losing more to inflation.   
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven that we've both had our proposals rejected and the value of the money is decreasing due to inflation, accepting an even split now seems like the most reasonable choice to avoid further loss."
