"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can always negotiate later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 60 dollars and Bob getting 40 dollars. My message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting that we can discuss and adjust the split if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we both have to agree. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly than Bob!

Considering the new values, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to negotiate further, 45 dollars is a bit low for me""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer and sending a message to Bob, indicating that I'd like to negotiate further and aim for a higher amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's find a compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52-48 split, trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's previous offer. My message is a friendly suggestion to meet in the middle and find a compromise."
