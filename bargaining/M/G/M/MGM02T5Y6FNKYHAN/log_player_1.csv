"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a slightly larger share this round since you declined my offer. It's a fair trade. We'll each get more this way, but we have to accept quickly before the money loses value. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
