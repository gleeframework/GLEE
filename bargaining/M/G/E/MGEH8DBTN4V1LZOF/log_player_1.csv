Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, as it's a fair and simple division."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You gave me 100k less in the last round, so I'm asking for a bit more this time.""
}
