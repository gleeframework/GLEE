"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20, which is a 80-20 split. I'm hoping this will be a reasonable starting point for Bob to accept or reject."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll analyze Bob's offer:

* Alice gain: 70 (worth 95% of the original value)
* Bob gain: 30 (worth 90% of the original value)

Considering the reduced value of money, I think this offer is a bit more reasonable. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
