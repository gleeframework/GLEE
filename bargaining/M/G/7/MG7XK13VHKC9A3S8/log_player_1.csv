Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a very unequal split. I'm taking most of the money, but I'm giving Bob a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept the offer. I'm taking a risk, but I want to get as much money as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a fair outcome given the risk of inflation.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and further rounds could result in less for me due to inflation."
