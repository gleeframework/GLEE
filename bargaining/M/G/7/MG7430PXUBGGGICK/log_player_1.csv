"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fair, considering the value of money decreases faster for you. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the value of money decreases faster for me, I'm willing to accept a slightly more even split. However, I think I can do better than 45-55.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to consider a more even split, but 45-55 is a bit too skewed towards you. Can you meet me in the middle at 50-50?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth 40% less now. Here's my new offer:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle at 50-50. Let's end the game here.""
