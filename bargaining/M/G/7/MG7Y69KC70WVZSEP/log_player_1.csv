Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm aiming for a more balanced split this time, Alice.  Let's close this out. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5600,
""bob_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a good deal for both of us.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. I'm proposing a split that's more in your favor. Let's settle this now. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Bob's offer seems to favor me, it's important to consider the impact of inflation. Accepting $4900 now is worth significantly less than what I could have gained in earlier rounds. While the risk is increasing, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal that accounts for the decreasing value of the money."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This offer makes sense considering the time pressure.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm trying to be fair, but we need to agree soon.  This is practically an even split. 
# Alice gain: 4950 
# Bob gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The value of the money is rapidly decreasing, and Bob is finally getting close to a near-even split. While I could gamble on getting a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds, there's a significant risk that Bob will not budge further. Accepting this offer guarantees a relatively even split considering the circumstances and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
