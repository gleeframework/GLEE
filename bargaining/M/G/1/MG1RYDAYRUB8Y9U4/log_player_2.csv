Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a good share to make this worthwhile. Let's avoid going further into the game and losing money to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, the impact of inflation is starting to become significant. It's worth risking another round to see if I can secure a better deal, even if it means my potential gains decrease slightly."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Inflation is eating our money!  Let's end this now with a fair 50/50 split.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a 50/50 split in round 4. Here's why:

* **Combating Inflation:** Delaying further heavily favors Alice due to the difference in inflation rates.  A quick agreement is the best way to maximize the actual value we both receive.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is undeniably fair and gives Alice little reason to continue playing a risky game. 
* **Potential Losses:**  Continuing risks significant losses for both of us as the rounds progress and inflation eats into the total."
