Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are severely impacting Bob's potential gains. Accepting Alice's offer of $450,000 is the most logical choice given the circumstances. Here's why:

* **Shrinking Value:**  The money is losing value for Bob rapidly. Waiting any longer means a significantly smaller payout, even if he manages to negotiate a slightly better split in future rounds.
* **Uncertain Outcome:** There's no guarantee that Alice will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. She might even stick closer to her previous offers, further diminishing Bob's potential reward.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** The risk of getting a much smaller amount in later rounds outweighs the potential reward of holding out for a slightly larger share now. 

While $450,000 is less than Bob's initial offers, it's the most pragmatic decision considering the game's rules and the current state of play."
