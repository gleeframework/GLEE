"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation rates.

Considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than meeting in the middle. I'll reject his offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll take 550000, you can have 450000""
}
```

Your turn again, Bob!"

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but don't get too comfortable!""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
