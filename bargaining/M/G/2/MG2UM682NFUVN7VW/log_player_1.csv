# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not ready to accept a 50/50 split just yet. I think I can do better than that. I'd like to propose a new offer and see if Bob is willing to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

I think 45-55 is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to accept this offer. It's not my initial goal, but I'm willing to settle for a slightly smaller share to avoid further negotiations and potential losses due to inflation."
