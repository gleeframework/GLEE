Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it more fairly, 60% for me, 40% for you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Okay, let's try this. I'll take 65% and you get 35%.  This seems like a good compromise.""}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I think 70% for me and 30% for you is a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While it's not ideal, the inflation is making my share worth less and less. Taking 30% is better than getting nothing in the next round."
