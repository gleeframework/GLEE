"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}

I propose a 95/5 split in my favor.  Since I'm going first, I'm taking the lion's share.  However, I'm also offering Bob something so he doesn't get nothing at all. Let's see if he's willing to accept this deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I reject this offer.  While I'm aware of the inflation, a 5/95 split is ridiculously unfair. I'll take my chances with the next round and try to negotiate a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I'm aware of the inflation, I think this offer is fair considering I'm making the proposal this round.  I'm willing to concede some ground from my previous offer to reach a compromise. Let's see if Bob is ready to settle."
