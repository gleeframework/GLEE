"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial 100$, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair! I'm offering a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the effective value of the money is decreasing, so I need to be more cautious. Since Bob is offering a more even split, I'll consider it. However, I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decreasing value of money. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm increasing my share to account for inflation. Let's see if you'll meet me halfway.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to split the money fairly. Let's compromise on a 60/40 split. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to make a similar offer to the one I made in Round 3, but with a slight adjustment. However, considering the inflation, the effective value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be careful not to give away too much.

Since the offer is the same as the one I made in Round 3, but with a slight twist, I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping it will take into account the accelerated inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is getting worse! With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll need to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Inflation is eating away at our potential earnings. I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We need to come to a compromise.  I'm offering a 45/55 split to account for inflation and ensure we both get something. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. Bob's offer seems reasonable, considering the circumstances. A 45/55 split might not be the best I can get, but it's a compromise that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It looks like I'll be taking home $55, which is worth less than $27.60 in the first round's value."
