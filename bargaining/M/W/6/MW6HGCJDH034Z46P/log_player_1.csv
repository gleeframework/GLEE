I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, hoping to secure a quick win.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to secure half of the remaining value than risk getting nothing in the next round.  The inflation is a significant factor here."
