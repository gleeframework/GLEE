"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose taking 900,000 for myself and giving 100,000 to Bob. This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking a larger share, but still leaving Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000} 
```

I'm going to try and get a larger share than Bob's offer, but still leave him with something.  Since the money is worth less with each round, I'm willing to concede a little to ensure I get a larger piece of the pie before it depreciates too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer isn't ideal, the inflation is making the money worth much less. It's better to accept and get a larger share of the remaining value."
