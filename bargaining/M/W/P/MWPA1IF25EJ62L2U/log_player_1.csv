Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 999,999$ and leave 1$ for Bob. 

This is a very aggressive offer, but I figure Bob might accept it as it's better than nothing. As the rounds go by, my money might lose value, so I need to secure as much as possible in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, taking 400,000 is significantly better than the 1$ offered in the previous round.  Even though there's inflation, I'm not sure how it affects Bob, so it's not worth risking getting nothing."
