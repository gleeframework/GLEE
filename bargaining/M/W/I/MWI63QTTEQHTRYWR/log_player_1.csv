  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""

I'm offering Bob $300,000, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can wrap up the game quickly."

# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split is a reasonable offer, but I'm not sure I want to give Bob half of the money. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

Round 3
