"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. I've attached a message saying ""Let's split fairly"" to convey that my offer is reasonable and we can both walk away with a good amount of money. Let me know what Bob decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a fair split, but this is my best offer before inflation diminishes the pot significantly. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle before it's too late""
}
```

Since Bob's offer was not acceptable to me, I'm making a new proposal. Considering the inflation, I'm still trying to find a mutually beneficial split. I've reduced my initial offer slightly, hoping Bob will see the value in accepting this proposal before the money loses even more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split. Let's not lose any more to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
