This is a classic game theory scenario, and I want to maximize my potential earnings.  

This offer aims to secure a large portion of the money while offering Bob a small amount.  It's likely he'll accept, especially if he doesn't know about the inflation. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the following rounds."

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While a 50/50 split is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a better deal.  Bob has already rejected my generous offer, indicating he wants more.  I'll counter in the next round, potentially offering a bit more to him, but still securing the majority for myself.  The inflation on his side might make him more eager to accept."

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation.  He's now offering me a lower share, but I'm not convinced this is the best I can do.

The inflation will continue to make my offer more appealing to him."

{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is very tempting, I am going to reject it.  I have held out this long, and with only one round remaining, I'm not going to settle for such a small share. Even though I don't know how much inflation is affecting him, I know that my offers have been consistently better for him in the past.  He may be willing to accept something closer to a 50/50 split to avoid getting nothing at all. I'm going to hold out for the best possible outcome in the final round."
