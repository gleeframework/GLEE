"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair 90/10 split.  Let's get this done quickly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm not going to accept a 90/10 split right off the bat.  I want a better deal.  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 60% and you get 40%.  This is a good starting point for negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but 70/30 is my final offer.  If you reject this, I'm not sure we'll be able to agree before the money is worthless. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd still prefer a higher split,  Alice's offer is much better than the previous round.  I don't want to risk losing all the money due to inflation.  Let's take the 30% and move on."
