Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40.  This gives us both a good amount, and avoids further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000
