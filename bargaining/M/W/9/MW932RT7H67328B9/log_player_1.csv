"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's start fair.  I propose we split the money 55/45, with me getting a bit more since we'll both lose money each round.  What do you say?""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation we'll both face.  Let's be realistic about the value of the money in the later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While a 60/40 split isn't ideal, it's better than risking a further reduction in my share due to inflation.  Bob's offer is still a decent gain considering the decreasing value of money.  It's better to accept and secure some profit rather than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
