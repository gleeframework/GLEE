"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and keep 60% for myself. What do you think?""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is a bit more fair. Let's get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me, and the money is worth less than before.

After considering Bob's offer, I think I can do better than 45%. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 52% is a more reasonable split. Let's meet in the middle and make a deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the difference. I think 52.5/47.5 is a fair compromise, and we can get this done before the money loses any more value. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering Bob's revised offer, I think 52.5/47.5 is a reasonable compromise. It's close to my previous offer, and it's a fair split. I'm willing to accept this offer to get a deal done.
