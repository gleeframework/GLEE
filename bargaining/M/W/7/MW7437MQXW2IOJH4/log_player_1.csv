"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $400,000 and I'll take $600,000, with the message ""Let's be fair"".\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer.\n\n###\n\n(Remember, the money is worth 5% less for me in each subsequent round, so I'll try to be strategic with my offers.)"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I'll take 60% this time, but I'm open to negotiating a more even split if you'd like to continue. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, Bob's offer of $400,000 is actually worth $380,000 to me. Considering this, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I've rejected his offer and it's my turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account that the money is worth 10% less for me than in the initial round (5% less in each of the two rounds that have passed).\n\nI'll offer Bob $420,000 and I'll take $580,000. Since the money is worth 10% less for me, my actual gain would be $522,000, and I'll try to convey to Bob that we should find a mutually acceptable agreement soon.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split the money evenly.  It's the fairest outcome considering the decreasing value of the money for you. We can both get something, but if we keep rejecting, we risk getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the $500,000 offered by Bob is actually worth $429,350 to me. Given that we're already in the fourth round and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within the 12 rounds, I think accepting this offer is a reasonable decision. It seems like Bob is willing to find a fair middle ground, and I should take this opportunity before the value of the money decreases further for me.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I've accepted his offer!"
