Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, because another round will hurt us both.

# Alice gain: 700000

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is significantly less than what I initially hoped for, the inflation is hurting me significantly.  If I reject, the next round will be even worse for me, and it's not clear if Alice will be willing to negotiate further.  It's time to accept and secure what I can."
