"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount to keep the negotiations going.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for the negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving away too much just yet. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 2, I need to consider that the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation. So, if Bob's offer is 6000, it's equivalent to 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79 in Round 1's value.

Considering this, I'll make my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not happy with the offer, and I'd like to negotiate further. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving up too much. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and keeping the negotiations going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, I need to consider that the money I gain is worth 14.26% less due to inflation. So, if Bob's offer is 5000, it's equivalent to 5000 / 0.858 (1 - 0.1426) = 5827.55 in Round 1's value.

Considering this, I'll make my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it seems like a fair compromise. I'll get 50% of the original $10,000, which is a decent outcome considering the inflation."
