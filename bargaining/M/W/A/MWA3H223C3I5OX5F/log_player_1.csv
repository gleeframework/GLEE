"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave 20% for Bob. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'm not thrilled about accepting a 45/55 split. I was hoping for a more favorable split for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Given that the money is worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. Accept this offer and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this 60/40 split, which is more favorable to me than his previous offer."
