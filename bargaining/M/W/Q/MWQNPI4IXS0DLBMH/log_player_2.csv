# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll try to get a bit more in the next round. The difference between 45 and 55 is still quite big."

# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nI think 49 is a reasonable amount, and the money is losing value quickly. I don't want to risk getting less in the next rounds, so I'll accept this offer."
