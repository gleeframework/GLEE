"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a fair initial offer, giving Bob a slightly larger share to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not thrilled with the 5% reduction in my share, accepting this offer is the best strategy.  The inflation rate is higher for Bob, and if I reject, the next round will likely see even more unfavorable terms for me."
