Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, let's meet in the middle 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a fairer split, it's still skewed in her favor considering the rapid depreciation of her potential gains. It's in my best interest to hold out a little longer and hope she proposes a more equitable split."

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd rather take a risk than accept an unfair split 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tables are turning. While not ideal, accepting a slightly unfavorable split now is better than risking getting even less in later rounds as the inflation heavily impacts Alice's potential gains."
