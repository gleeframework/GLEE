"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm passing the message to Bob that we can start with an equal division."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split. I'd like to negotiate further and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but still a compromise. I'm passing the message to Bob that I'm trying to find a fair middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise further, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response to Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than a 45/55 split. I'd like to keep negotiating to try to get a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a 52/48 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my previous offers, but still slightly more favorable to me than his previous offers. I'm passing the message to Bob that I'm trying to find a fair middle ground."
