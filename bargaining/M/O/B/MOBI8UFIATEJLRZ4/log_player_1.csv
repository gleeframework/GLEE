I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. It's important to get a feel for how Bob plays. If he rejects, I'll be able to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 750000 
# Bob gain: 250000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best strategy. The inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly.  It's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round, and the risk of ending up with nothing is too high."
