```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'm willing to give you 40% of the money to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000, and I'll take the remaining $600,000."

# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's split the money evenly for now. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I accept Bob's offer for Round 2:
