Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take $5,500 and you take $4,500. Since the money loses value for me each round, I'm willing to take a bit more than half to make up for the loss. It's still a good deal for you!

# Bob gain: 5500

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the significant loss in value for me, I need to take a larger share to compensate. I'll take $6,000 and you take $4,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting desperate, and his offers are getting worse for me. While the nominal value of his offer seems better,  the real value for him is much lower due to inflation. I'm willing to gamble that he'll crack and offer a more favorable split in the next round."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking, and every round hurts you more than it hurts me. This is my final offer: $6,500 for me, and $3,500 for you. It's still a decent chunk of the pie, even with the inflation.  Let's be realistic and close this deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, but he's also getting increasingly stubborn.  I need to balance pushing for a good deal with the risk of him accepting a smaller and smaller amount. This offer is my attempt to project strength while still giving him a somewhat reasonable offer.  It's a gamble, but at this point, every round is a gamble."
