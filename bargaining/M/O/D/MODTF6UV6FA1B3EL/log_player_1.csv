"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to think about the long-term consequences of accepting this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 40/60, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll give you 55, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm willing to give Bob 55, which is a slightly better deal than his initial offer, but still a bit more than what I'd like to give."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 35, but I think I deserve more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my share! With the money worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. However, I'm not willing to accept a 35/65 split, especially since Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the inflation. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70, ""message"": ""I'll give you 70, but I think I'm getting desperate""}

I'm willing to give Bob a larger share, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'm hoping Bob will take this offer and we can finally settle on a deal."
