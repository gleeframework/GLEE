"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to keep 900,000 for myself and give Bob 100,000.  I think this is a fair first offer.  We can negotiate further if you think it's not a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
``` 

I propose a 550,000/450,000 split.  Since Bob was willing to give me only 300,000 last round, this is a compromise that gives us both more than we had before.  Hopefully, we can agree on this and avoid further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While it's a lower amount than I hoped for, it's better than risking further losses due to inflation.  Accepting will at least give me a decent amount."
