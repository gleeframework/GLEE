Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share than before, but I still think I deserve more than you're offering. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, and the inflation is significantly impacting his potential gains. While his offer is closer to a more even split, I believe I can push for a better deal in the next round.  The longer Bob waits, the less appealing his share becomes, giving me more leverage."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5300,
""bob_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. Take it before inflation shrinks your share even further. It's a fair deal.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Leverage:** Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation. He's offered a larger share to me in the last two rounds, showing I have negotiating power.
* **Slight Increase:** I'm slightly increasing my previous offer to show a willingness to compromise, but not by much.
* **Finality:** Presenting this as my ""final offer"" adds weight and might push Bob to accept before his position weakens further."
