"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 600,000 and Bob getting 400,000. The message is a bit cheeky, but I'm hoping Bob will see the value in taking it and moving on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm willing to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I've decided to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not willing to accept an 80-20 split, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll hold out for a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:
