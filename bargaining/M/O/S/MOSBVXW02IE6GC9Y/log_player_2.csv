"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. A fair deal for both of us, considering the inflation working against you. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Let's see how the game unfolds. Alice is trying to take advantage early on, but I'm patient."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile. This offer considers the inflation we both face.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but I need a decent share too. This offer is a compromise, especially considering the value decrease in later rounds. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is slowly increasing my share, but it's still not enough to offset the rapid inflation I'm facing. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The inflation is severe, and this is the most equitable split considering the circumstances.""}
