  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""

```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair start. Let's see if you accept. 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get the majority of the money!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd like to get a better deal. I'm hoping to negotiate further and get a more equal split."

  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
