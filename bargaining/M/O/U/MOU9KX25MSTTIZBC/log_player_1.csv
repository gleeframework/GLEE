"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, leaving me with $600,000 and Bob with $400,000. My message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to negotiate if he's not satisfied with the split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. I'm willing to offer you a more even split. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! My potential gain is now worth 20% less than it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm inclined to accept. The 45-55 split is closer to even, and I'm willing to compromise to avoid further inflation.
