"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is my initial offer, assuming Bob is also aware of the inflation. I'm giving Bob a small portion to hopefully encourage him to accept, but I'm keeping the majority for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

This round, I'm decreasing my offer by 10% (the inflation rate), but I'm still offering Bob more than the previous round in hopes that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1900 
# Bob gain: 8100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm getting significantly less than I initially hoped for, accepting this offer is the best option at this point.  Inflation has eroded the value of my potential earnings significantly, and if I reject this, there's no guarantee that Bob will make me a better offer in the future.  It's better to take what I can get now."
