"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more since you're losing value each round 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The inflation is hitting me hard, Bob. I need a better deal this time.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is on your side of the table, I'm taking a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on due to inflation, accepting this offer would mean settling for less than Bob's initial offer in Round 1.  I need to hold out for a better deal, even if it's just slightly better than what Bob is offering now."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be real.  The clock is ticking, and this offer is the fairest we'll get at this point.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The longer this goes on, the worse it gets for me due to the inflation.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point. Bob is unlikely to offer anything better knowing the pressure is on me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is on my side, and inflation is crushing your share. Take this before it gets worse 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but the situation is becoming critical. Bob is playing hardball, and the inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. If I reject this offer, there's a very real chance I'll end up with even less in the next round.  Accepting this offer cuts my losses and ensures I at least get something out of this deal."
