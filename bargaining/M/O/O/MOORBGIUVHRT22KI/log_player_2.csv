"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I think 70/30 is a fair split in the first round. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the inflation rates, I think I can get a better deal later on. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think this is a more reasonable split. Let's make a deal!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth less to Alice with each passing round, so I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the inflation hits me harder. Let's settle this - 65/35. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think I can get a better deal. With the inflation rates, Alice is losing more value with each passing round, so I'm hoping she'll be more willing to compromise in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation is hitting you harder, but I'm also losing value. This is my compromise - let's split the difference!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm trying to appear more reasonable and willing to compromise, while still taking advantage of the inflation rates. I'm hoping Alice will see this as a fair deal and accept it. Let's see what she says!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time, and this is hurting both of us.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but 60/40 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI think I've pushed Alice as far as she's willing to go, and considering the inflation rates, 40 is a decent amount for me at this point. I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value, so I'll accept this offer.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
