"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I need to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is quite generous, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially getting a worse deal.

I accept Bob's offer.
