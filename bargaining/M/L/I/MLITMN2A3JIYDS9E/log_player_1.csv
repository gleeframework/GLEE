"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good start""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which I believe is a generous and reasonable starting point for our negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the fairness in this proposal and accept it, considering we both want to avoid the negative impact of inflation on the money's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be fair, how about this? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not satisfied with Bob's offer, as I believe 45% is too low considering my initial offer was 60% for myself. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think we can find a better balance. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle of our previous offers""}\n\n###\n\nI've considered Bob's previous offer and decided to meet him halfway between our previous proposals. This way, we both compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will see the reasonableness in this offer. We should try to find a mutually acceptable solution before the inflation devalues the money further."
