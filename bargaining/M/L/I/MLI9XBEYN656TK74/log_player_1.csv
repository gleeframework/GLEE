"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick deal.  I'll take 90% and leave Bob with 10%. Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best move given the inflation.  500,000 is still a significant amount, and I risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers."
