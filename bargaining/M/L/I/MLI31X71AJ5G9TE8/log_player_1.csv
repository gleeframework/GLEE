Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're right, it's getting ridiculous. But not in the way you think. Inflation is killing your share, and I'm taking advantage of it. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

This is a tough situation, and rationally I should hold out for more. However, with the inflation rate, my share is rapidly diminishing. Accepting Bob's offer, while far from ideal, is the best way to salvage something from this negotiation.  If I reject this offer, it's likely Bob will offer even less in the next round, leaving me with a worse deal."
