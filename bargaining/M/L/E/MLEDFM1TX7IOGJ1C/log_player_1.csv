"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, and keeping $900,000 for myself. The message is a bit aggressive, but I'm trying to set the tone for the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll re-evaluate Bob's offer. Since Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, that means he's offering me $380,000 in real terms (400,000 - 5% of 400,000).

Considering my gain of $600,000 is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll accept this offer. It's a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the inflation factor working against me.
