Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  This is a fair deal, and with inflation kicking in, it's the best way to ensure we both get a decent amount.  Let's see if Bob agrees."
