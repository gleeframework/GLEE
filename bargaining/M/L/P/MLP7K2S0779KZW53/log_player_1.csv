"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a third""
}
```

This way, I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering we both get to keep more than we did in your offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth 0.95 \* 45 = 42.75.

I'm not sure if 55/45 is a good deal for me, considering I could have had 70. But I don't want to be too greedy and risk Bob rejecting again.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
