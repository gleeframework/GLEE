"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can negotiate further in the next rounds if you'd like. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! I'm sure we can come to a more equitable agreement.  Let's see what she offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I believe a 70/30 split is more in line with a fair outcome. What do you think?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move a bit closer to your proposal. How about an 80/20 split? This allows for some compromise while still giving me a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but that's still not a good deal for me, especially with inflation eating into my potential gains.  Let's see if I can push her further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 600000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try another compromise. A 70/30 split would be closer to my preferred outcome, while still giving you a considerable share. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting closer to a reasonable split, but with inflation eating into my share, I need to hold out for a bit longer.  She's starting to move towards my offers, so she's feeling the pressure."
