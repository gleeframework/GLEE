"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. The message is a friendly nudge to start with a reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can't have it all, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
It's a generous offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with the value of the money decreasing further."
