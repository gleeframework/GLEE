"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, it's a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's proposal. I was hoping to get a better deal, especially considering the inflation. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'll compromise, let's split it 50/50""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000. I'm willing to meet Bob halfway to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
