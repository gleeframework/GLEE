"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a starting point. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor, Alice. How about a 45/55 split?  It's still in your best interest to accept quickly, given the inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation hurts me more than it hurts you. I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. 65/35 is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which is good for me. While the inflation is affecting her more, I can still hold out for a better deal.

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand the inflation is hitting you hard, but your demands are unrealistic. This offer gives you a slight edge, but let's close this deal before the money shrinks further.""}
