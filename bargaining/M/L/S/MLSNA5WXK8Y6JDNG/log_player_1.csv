"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself, which is a 20% share for him and 80% for me. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a higher share, but not too generous at this point. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually worth $5,400 in the original amount.

I'm not too thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```

I'm not going to accept this offer, hoping that Bob will make a more generous proposal in the next round."

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
