I'm Bob, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm going to reject this offer and see what Alice proposes next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script! This time I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as you suggested 60/40 in your favor.  Let's see if we can agree on something.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Even though I was hoping for more, it's better to take what I can get before the inflation hurts me too much."
