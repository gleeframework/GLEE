"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as Alice. This is a fair starting point, and hopefully, Bob will see the benefit of accepting it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still hoping for a fair split, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  This offer still favors me, but I've lowered my share by 10% to show good faith.  Hopefully, Bob will see this as a step in the right direction and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided in his favor. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to accept a deal where I'm getting only 20% of the money.  I'm hoping he'll realize that we need to come to a more equitable solution, otherwise we'll both end up with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm also increasing Bob's.  We're getting closer to a fair split.  If we both keep rejecting offers, we'll lose more money.  It's time for a compromise.  I hope Bob sees this as a good faith effort and will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair, and we're getting closer to the point where both of us will lose a lot.  I believe that we can reach a more equitable split than this, and I'm willing to keep negotiating to find it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  We're both losing money with each round that passes.  It's time to accept a fair and equal division of the remaining money.  I hope Bob will finally agree to this."
