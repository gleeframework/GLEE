I propose a fair and equal split. Let's see if Bob agrees!"

I reject this offer. While the money is worth less, I am not willing to accept such a disproportionate split. I am confident I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split for Bob than the first round, but I still want a reasonable share.  Hopefully, this shows him I'm willing to compromise while still looking out for my own interests."

# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I reject this offer. It's getting increasingly unfair, and I won't settle for such a small share.  Even with the inflation, I believe I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering a slightly lower share for myself than the previous round, acknowledging the inflation. I believe this shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a decent share."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is simply too unfair, even with the inflation. I'm not willing to accept such a small portion of the money.  I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 35, ""bob_gain"": 65}

I'm lowering my share again, acknowledging the inflation. This is my final offer. I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of reaching a deal before the money becomes worth even less."

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is completely unacceptable. While the money is worth less, it's not worth settling for such a small share.  It's clear Bob is being unreasonable, and I'm not willing to be taken advantage of. I will continue to negotiate for a fairer deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 30, ""bob_gain"": 70}
```

I'm willing to accept a smaller share to reach an agreement. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping Bob realizes that continuing to reject offers will only lead to both of us getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is ludicrous. Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I am not willing to accept such a small share, especially with so few rounds remaining.  I'm determined to fight for a fairer outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 25, ""bob_gain"": 75}
```

This is my final offer. I'm willing to accept a very small share to avoid getting nothing. The inflation has been severe, and I believe that both of us should at least get something rather than risking losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 0.01 
# Bob gain: 99.99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is insulting. Even with the significant inflation, it's clear Bob is trying to exploit the situation for a massive gain at my expense.  I refuse to accept this offer, and I'm prepared to walk away with nothing rather than submit to such unfair treatment."
