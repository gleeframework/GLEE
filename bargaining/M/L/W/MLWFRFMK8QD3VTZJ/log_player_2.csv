It's too early in the game to accept such a low offer. I'll see what Alice proposes next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}

Let's start with a fair offer, Alice.  We both get a decent share."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer more, this is a fair offer considering the inflation. Accepting this ensures we both get a substantial amount, and avoids the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
