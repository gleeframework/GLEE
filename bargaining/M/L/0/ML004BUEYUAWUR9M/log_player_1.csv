"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 20% and keep the rest. It's a fair compromise! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I'm not sure I want to give up 80% of the remaining value. I'll try to negotiate a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, my offer needs to be adjusted to account for the 20% decrease in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 300000,
  ""bob_gain"": 700000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I need some. Will you accept?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, offering Bob a larger share, but still keeping a significant amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take most of it, but I'll give you a small consolation prize. You can't afford to reject this! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! Bob's offer is quite one-sided, but I don't have much choice at this point. I'll accept the offer to avoid losing even more value.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $100,000 consolation prize and hope it's enough to make it worth playing the game."
