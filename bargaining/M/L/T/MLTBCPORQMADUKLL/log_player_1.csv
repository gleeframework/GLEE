"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $100,000, a fair share. Accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small portion, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  It's a fair deal, and we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to consider the offer carefully. However, Bob's proposal is to split the remaining amount evenly, which means I'll get $500,000. This is a significant amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further. I'm hoping to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll have to adjust my offer accordingly. Since I rejected the even split, I'll try to get a slightly better deal for myself.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $450,000, a decent share. Accept?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a bit more than the even split, but still a reasonable amount considering the remaining value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. I'm offering you a good share, and this ensures we both get something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less now, and I need to make a decision quickly. Bob's offer is still a bit skewed towards him, but it's not terrible. I'll have to consider the fact that the money is worth even less now, and I might not get a better offer in the next round.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
