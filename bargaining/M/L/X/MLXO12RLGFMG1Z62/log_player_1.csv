I propose a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to try to get a slightly better deal this round. I'll offer Bob $200,000, which is a bit more than he got in round 2."
