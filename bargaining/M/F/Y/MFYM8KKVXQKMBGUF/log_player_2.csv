"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While it seems like a ""fair"" 50/50 split on the surface, the inflation dynamic means I lose value every round.  I need to push for a better deal in the early stages."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn.  The inflation hurts you more than me, so let's make a deal that reflects this. This offer gives you a good amount upfront.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this deal gives us both a reasonable share. Consider the impact of inflation on future rounds. It's time to settle. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is trying to pressure me with the inflation, but this offer is still too skewed in her favor. I need to hold out for a better split, banking on her aversion to losing value in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and the value decreases with every round, especially for you.  This offer gives us both a chance to walk away with something substantial.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a sizable share.  Let's stop wasting time with these back-and-forth offers.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right, a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.  While I'd prefer a larger share, the longer we drag this out, the more her share devalues, making a 50/50 split the most logical outcome anyway. Accepting now avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
