Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 990,000 / 10,000 split.  It's a significant advantage for me, but I'm trying to be somewhat fair while still taking advantage of the inflation factor.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm unhappy with the 100,000/900,000 split, it's important to consider the inflation. My share is worth 20% less than the previous round, and Bob's offer is a good deal compared to what I could potentially get in the next round. It's better to take what I can get now."
