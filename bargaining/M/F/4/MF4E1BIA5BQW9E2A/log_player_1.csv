"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's compromise 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll consider the proposal carefully.

Since Bob is suggesting a 50-50 split, which is a compromise, I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
