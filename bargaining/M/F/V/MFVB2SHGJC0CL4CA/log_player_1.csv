"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust from here if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, but I'm looking for a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'd like to propose a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share""}

I'm proposing that I get $5,500 and Bob gets $4,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still hoping to get a slightly better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up, I want a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my share!

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, but I'm getting desperate. I'll have to think carefully about whether to accept this offer or not.

After considering the decreased value of the money, I'll accept Bob's offer. I'm not getting any younger, and I don't want to risk losing everything.
