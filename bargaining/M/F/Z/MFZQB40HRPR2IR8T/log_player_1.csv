"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer is a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm going for a larger share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of the decreasing value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer means I get to take home some money.  Since the value of money is decreasing with each round, waiting for another round might result in a smaller gain for me."
