"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's start fair, but remember, the money loses value with each round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer is not satisfactory, considering the significant difference in the amount we each receive. I'm willing to take the risk of the money losing value to potentially get a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round where I can propose a different division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the money's devaluation for me.""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'm considering the fact that the money loses 20% of its value for me, so I'm aiming for a more balanced distribution. By offering Alice $600,000 and taking $400,000, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that accounts for the devaluation while still being reasonable for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need more than 600k.  This is a fair offer given the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nAlthough the money's value is decreasing for me, I still believe that accepting $300,000 is not the best option. Given the significant difference in our gains, I'm willing to take the risk and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal despite the impact of inflation on my potential earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the increased inflation for me, I'm still willing to compromise but need a bit more than before to make it worthwhile.""}\n\n###\nGiven that the money is now worth 36% less for me than in the first round, I need to adjust my proposal to compensate for this loss. By offering Alice $580,000 and taking $420,000, I'm trying to balance the impact of inflation on my earnings while still making the deal attractive to Alice. This is a bit more than my previous offer, reflecting the urgency due to the devaluation of the money for me."
