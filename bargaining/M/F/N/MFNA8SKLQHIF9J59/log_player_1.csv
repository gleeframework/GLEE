"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this new offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the absolute values. Bob is offering me $300,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial proposal of $500,000.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than last time!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and being willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not giving up on getting a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer, taking into account the changing value of the money due to inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the absolute values. Bob is offering me $400,000, which is still lower than my initial proposal of $500,000.

However, I notice that Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, which means he's getting a relatively better deal than me. I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40.9% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my proposal accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my initial target!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and being willing to compromise, while also considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money."
