"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I am the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  A 50/50 split is fair, and with the inflation, I don't want to risk getting less in the next round."
