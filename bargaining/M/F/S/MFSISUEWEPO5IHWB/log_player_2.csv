# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI still think Alice's offer is not fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get a better deal. The inflation is a concern, but I believe I can still get a more favorable division. Let's see what happens in the next round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is the same offer as Round 1, Bob.  Time is running out - take the deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I think it's time to accept Alice's offer. The deal is the same as in Round 1, but due to inflation, the actual value of the money has decreased substantially. I don't think I can get a better offer at this point, and it's better to take the deal rather than risking getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
