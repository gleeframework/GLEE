# Alice gain: 58

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value every round, don't wait too long! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the inflation is hurting, accepting a deal where I consistently get less than Alice isn't smart.  I need to push for a more even split, and the threat of getting nothing at all might make Alice more agreeable as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out! This is my final offer. You're getting the better end of the deal, so take it before inflation eats away at my share even more.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm giving you one more chance. Inflation is really hurting your share now. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough call, but with the inflation accelerating, my position is getting worse with every passing round. Alice knows this and is unlikely to offer anything better.  If I reject this, she's likely to offer me even less next round, and we're getting dangerously close to both getting nothing."
