"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. We can adjust later.

# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to try to negotiate a better deal! 10% is too low, especially considering the inflation will hurt me more in later rounds."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think 55/45 is a fair split. We're both losing money with each round, so let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
The inflation is hitting me hard, but I think I can get a better deal.  I'll wait and see what Alice offers next."
