"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my initial offer. I'm taking a large share, but I'm willing to give Bob something to incentivize him to accept. I'm hoping he'll see that it's better to take a small amount now than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! I'm not going to accept such a lopsided deal. I'll take my chances with a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob slightly, but still keeping the majority for myself.  This offer is more balanced, and hopefully, Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept before we both lose more money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even with the inflation.  I'm willing to take a little less in the next round to ensure we don't both lose everything."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, hoping to find a compromise.  With each round, the risk of losing everything increases.  This offer is more balanced, and I believe it's in Bob's best interest to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob is offering me more than in previous rounds, it is still not enough for me to accept. With the inflation, we are both losing a significant amount of money with each passing round, and I believe we can still find a more balanced solution. I will try to negotiate a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This is my final offer. With inflation, our options are dwindling.  I believe this is the most equitable solution considering the circumstances.  Let's both take an equal share and avoid losing everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is just too low. Even with the significant inflation, I'm not going to accept such a small share.  With each passing round, our chances of getting nothing are growing, but I'm hoping we can still find a better compromise in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, trying to meet him halfway. The inflation is hitting us both hard now. I'm willing to give up more to reach an agreement before we both lose everything."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. Even though the inflation is significantly affecting us both, I refuse to accept such a small share. There are only two rounds remaining, and I believe we can still reach a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000}
```

With only two rounds left, the situation is dire. We're both losing a lot of money due to inflation. I'm offering Bob a larger share than before, hoping to finally find a solution that he will accept. I'm willing to take a significant loss to avoid both of us getting nothing."

# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is ridiculous!  Bob is being incredibly greedy, offering me a pittance while he takes almost everything.  Even with the inflation, I won't accept this offer.  I'd rather get nothing than be exploited like this.  It's clear that he's willing to risk us both getting nothing just to maximize his own gains."
