Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This split accounts for the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can find a middle ground. This offer is closer to 50/50, but still accounts for the fact that you have to wait longer to get your share.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is money Alice, and it's slipping away. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a more even split, Bob's offer is still better than getting nothing due to the rapidly increasing inflation."
