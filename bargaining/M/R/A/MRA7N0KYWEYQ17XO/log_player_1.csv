"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. The message is a friendly opening offer, suggesting we start with a fair split and then see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the inflation factor.  Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, my gain is still $600,000, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, so he's offering me the same amount as in the first round, but it's actually worth more to me now.

I'll reject this offer, as it's the same as the one I initially proposed, and I'd like to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I'm still hoping for a good deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. The message is a friendly but firm negotiation, suggesting that I'm willing to compromise but still want a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share than the previous offer to make it worthwhile.  Let's go back to a 60/40 split. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, my gain is still $600,000, but Bob's gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

However, Bob is now offering the same amount as in the first round, but it's worth less to him due to inflation. Considering the current state of the game, I think this is a good opportunity for me to get a better deal.

I'll accept this offer.
