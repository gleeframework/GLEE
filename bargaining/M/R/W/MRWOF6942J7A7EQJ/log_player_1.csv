"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations. I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable to me as the previous one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the decreased value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob this time, but still trying to get a good share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly! Given the current offers, I think I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking getting nothing at this point.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
