"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose taking 900,000 dollars and leaving Bob with 100,000. This ensures I get a significant portion of the money while still offering Bob something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 800,000 for myself and 200,000 for Bob.  Since the money I receive is worth less with each round, I need to ensure I still get a substantial amount. However, I'm willing to compromise to avoid the risk of getting nothing in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I am losing a significant amount due to inflation, it's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
