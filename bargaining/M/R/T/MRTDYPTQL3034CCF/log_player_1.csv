Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my gain of $20 is worth even less than I thought, but Bob's gain of $80 is also significantly reduced. I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer or wait for a better one.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a better offer this time, taking into account the inflation.
