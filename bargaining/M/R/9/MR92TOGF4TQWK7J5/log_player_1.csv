"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. The message is a straightforward one - take it or leave it, and we'll proceed to the next round if you reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split it more evenly this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my $600,000 from the previous round is now worth $570,000, and Bob's $400,000 is now worth $320,000.

I'm not impressed with Bob's revised offer, as it seems like he's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal. My gain is worth 5% less, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, which is a bigger discount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer, taking into account the inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm giving up some of my potential gains to account for the inflation, but I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer."
