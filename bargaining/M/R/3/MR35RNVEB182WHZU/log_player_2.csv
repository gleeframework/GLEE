**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're now past the halfway point with the clock ticking. 
* **Favorable Shift:** Alice's offer has become more generous. It's now a 55/45 split in my favor, a significant improvement from her initial offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While holding out for more is tempting, the risk of getting nothing increases with each round. Accepting a 55% share guarantees a good sum of money. 

It's better to secure a win now than risk losing everything in pursuit of a slightly larger share."
