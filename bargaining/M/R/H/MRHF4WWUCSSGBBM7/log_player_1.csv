Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor. I'm proposing a 70/30 split. Take this offer or watch the value of the money shrink, especially for you. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
