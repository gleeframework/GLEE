"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 4000, and I'll take 6000. You can try to do better next round!""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share, and I'm leaving room for Bob to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. You can try to do better next round! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation still affecting the value of the money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not giving up much. You can try to do better next round!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share by 300, hoping Bob will accept or that the next round will bring a better opportunity for me."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation reducing the value of the money by 27.1% from the first round, my gain is now worth significantly less. I need to be even more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer, hoping to get a better deal, but I'm getting a bit concerned that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the value of the money continuing to decrease, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Since I'm already at 5200 in the previous round, I'll try to increase my share a bit more.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll try to get a better deal this round. I'm not giving up much, but I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll make a 50/50 offer. It's a fair deal, and I think we can both be happy with it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the value of the money decreasing by 40.95% from the first round, my gain is now worth significantly less. A 50/50 split is a fair offer, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's a fair deal, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round. I'll take the 50/50 split and hope it's the best I can get."
