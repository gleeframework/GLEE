"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer, considering I could try to take more. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him more likely to accept the offer. Since it's the first round, I'm trying to set a tone for the negotiations and avoid being too aggressive, which could lead to a long and costly game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. With the money being worth 20% less for me, I need to aim for a higher nominal value to compensate for the loss. Since Bob's offer is not significantly better than my initial offer, I'll try to negotiate further. Additionally, I want to see how Bob reacts to rejection and if he's willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm being generous""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer than in the first round, taking into account the inflation that affects me more than Bob. By offering Bob $42, I'm trying to test his limits and see how much he's willing to compromise. The message is an attempt to frame my offer as generous, despite it being less favorable to Bob than his previous offer. I'm trying to create a sense of urgency and make Bob consider the potential losses if the game continues."
