"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fair deal considering the inflation.  If you accept, we can both get a good amount.  If we keep going, we both risk losing a lot of money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is tempting, especially with the looming threat of inflation. However, it's clear he's trying to use the time pressure to his advantage. Let's push back a little and see if we can negotiate a better deal.
