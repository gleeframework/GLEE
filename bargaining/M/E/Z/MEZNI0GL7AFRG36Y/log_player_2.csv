Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's meet halfway and wrap this up. Time is money, literally! 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the deal is getting closer to even, time is working against me. Alice is offering slightly more than I offered last round, but I need to push for a more favorable split before inflation eats away too much of my potential gains."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This is slightly more beneficial for me given the inflation, but still a reasonable compromise. Let's close this out. 
# Bob gain: 4950 
# Alice gain: 5050 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The game has shifted considerably in Alice's favor due to inflation. She's now very close to an even split, and further refusals are likely to result in increasingly worse offers from her. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if I push too hard."
