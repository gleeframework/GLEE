"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an aggressive offer to try to get a good deal early on. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a fair deal. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
