"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is a pretty aggressive offer, but it's a good starting point. I'm hoping to maximize my share while still incentivizing Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is still a very unfair offer. While the inflation makes the money worth less for both of us, Bob is still getting a much larger share. I'm going to reject this and hope for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this round. While I still want a larger share, I'm acknowledging that Bob also needs to benefit. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him than the previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this offer. While the inflation has decreased the value of the money significantly, Bob's offer is still not equitable.  I'll reject and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

This is a compromise offer. I'm taking into account the inflation and trying to find a split that might be more appealing to Bob, even though it's still more favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a fair offer considering the inflation. While it's not ideal, it's better than risking getting nothing in the end."
