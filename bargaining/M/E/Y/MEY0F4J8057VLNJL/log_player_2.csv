Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective, Bob. Let's try a 45/55 split in my favor. This is a more reasonable compromise considering the decreasing value. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer makes sense in Round 3 for a few reasons:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth. A 55/45 split in Alice's favor might sting, but waiting for a better deal means the potential gains shrink considerably.
* **Alice's Movement:** Alice started very high (90/10) and has come down to 45/55. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal (e.g., 60/40 in Bob's favor) is very risky.  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better, and both players lose money as time goes on. 

**In summary, taking the 55/45 deal now guarantees a reasonable payout, even if it's not the ideal outcome.**"
