"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, and I was initially offered $600,000, I now get $600,000 * 0.9 = $540,000.

Bob's offer is $500,000 for me and $500,000 for him. This is less than what I would get if I accepted the first offer, and less than what I would get if I accepted Bob's offer in the first round.

I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so I'll get 90% of the 90% of the initial amount I would have gotten in Round 2, which is 0.9 * 0.9 * 600,000 = 486,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 486000, ""bob_gain"": 514000}
```"
