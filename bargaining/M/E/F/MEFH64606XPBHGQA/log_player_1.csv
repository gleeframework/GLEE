Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me a large share, knowing that the value of money will decrease in each round.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is better for me than what I offered Bob, it's still a very lopsided deal. I believe I can do better, especially given the decreasing value of money. I will try to negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm offering a more even split this time, with a slight advantage for Bob. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him and we can reach an agreement."
