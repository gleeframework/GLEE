Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, I should get a slight advantage considering the inflation and the fact that you rejected my initial offer.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's settle this. We'll split it evenly like you initially proposed.  The longer we wait, the less we both get. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking Bob proposing a worse deal in the next round where the money will be worth even less."
