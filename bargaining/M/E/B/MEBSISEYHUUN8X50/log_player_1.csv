"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40. No need to negotiate further.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair.  Let's keep things moving. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less for Bob, so he's trying to get a bigger share. I'll consider this offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
