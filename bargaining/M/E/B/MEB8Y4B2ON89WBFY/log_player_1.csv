"Round 1

```

  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal""

```

Round 2

# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to be more cautious. Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject it.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than $6,000. I'll wait for his next proposal!"
