Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing to keep $9000 and give Bob $1000.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking the risk of being the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8100, ""bob_gain"": 1900}
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer and the money is now worth less, I need to offer him a bit more. However, I am still aiming for a significant share. I'm offering $8100 for myself and $1900 for Bob. This is a fair compromise considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm still holding out for a better deal. While the inflation has hurt my gains, it's also affected Bob's, so I'm not ready to accept this offer yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7290, ""bob_gain"": 2710}
```

I'm making a final push to get a good deal. I'm offering $7290 for myself and $2710 for Bob. While the inflation continues to hurt my potential gains, I believe this offer is still fair considering Bob's rejected offers and the decreasing value of the money."
