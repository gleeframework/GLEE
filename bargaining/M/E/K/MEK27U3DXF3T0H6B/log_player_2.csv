**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a reasonable split, time pressure is working against me more than her.  I need to signal I'm willing to accept a less favorable split, but not this low.  There's a good chance she'll offer a larger sum to me next round to avoid getting nothing."
