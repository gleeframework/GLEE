"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets the remaining 40%, which is $40. I think this is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I want something too! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'm willing to negotiate, but I think I can do better than 70-30. I'll reject this offer and wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more generous split, giving Bob 45% of the remaining $100, which is $45, and keeping 55% for myself, which is $55. I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and holding onto a decent amount of money. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the hit, but I'm not giving up yet! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer again. I understand that he's trying to hold on to as much as possible, but I'm starting to feel like I'm giving away too much. The money is worth significantly less now due to inflation, and I'm not comfortable with an 80-20 split. I'll reject this offer and hope that Bob will come back with a more reasonable proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, it's only fair!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable proposal given the current state of the money due to inflation. I'm willing to compromise and meet Bob halfway, hoping that he'll accept this offer and we can finally settle on a division."
