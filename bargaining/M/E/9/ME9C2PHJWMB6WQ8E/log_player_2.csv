"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor, considering I have a smaller inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I want a better deal than 45%.  Let's see if I can negotiate something more favorable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a fair split, considering the inflation rates. Let's get this done quickly, before the money loses more value!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it evenly this time, considering the increasing inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While a 50/50 split isn't ideal, the inflation rate is starting to hit hard, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  Let's take the 50 and move on."
