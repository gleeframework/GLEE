I propose Alice receives $9,000 and Bob receives $1,000. This seems like a fair starting point, as I want to ensure we both get a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for inflation, but still aiming for a good share of the money. This offer reflects the value of the money after two rounds of inflation, and I believe it's a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a very uneven offer. While I understand inflation is playing a role, I'm willing to hold out for a more equitable share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200}
```

I'm adjusting my offer again to account for the further inflation. While I would prefer a larger share, I'm trying to be realistic and find a balance that allows us both to receive a significant amount."
