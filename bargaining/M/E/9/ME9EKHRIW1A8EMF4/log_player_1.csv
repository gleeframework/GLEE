"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 4:1 in favor of Alice. This way, we can ensure a fair distribution considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor.  While the money loses value for me each round, it's important we both get a decent share. This offer is fairer than the previous one, and gives us a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
