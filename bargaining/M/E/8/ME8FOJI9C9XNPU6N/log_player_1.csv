Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer, leaving Bob with 10% of the money. This is a good starting point to see if he's willing to accept a quick split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I prefer to keep more of the money, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy right now.  Inflation is a factor, and I'd rather get 5000 than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
