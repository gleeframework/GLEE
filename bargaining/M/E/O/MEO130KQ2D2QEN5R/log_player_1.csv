Let's see if Bob is willing to accept a deal that gives me the majority of the money.  I'm aiming for a big gain, but I'm also willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse than my previous one, and he is taking advantage of the inflation to try to get a larger share. I won't accept this unfair offer. I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm lowering my offer slightly to account for the inflation, but I'm still aiming for a significant share of the money. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still terrible and completely ignores the fact that the money is worth significantly less for me now. I'm not going to accept that.  I will make a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  I need to make a deal quickly before the inflation eats away at my share too much."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000

{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is still ridiculously unfair, especially considering the inflation. I'm not going to accept it. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm getting desperate. I need to accept a deal soon.  Inflation is eating away at my share of the money. But I'm not going to give up the majority just yet. I'm hoping Bob will finally see reason and accept a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is outrageous. He's taking advantage of the inflation and ignoring the fact that my share of the money is worth less than half of what it was in the first round. I'm not going to give in to his greed. I'll try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split.  With the inflation, I'm getting a much smaller share than I initially wanted. But, I need to make a deal soon.  I'm hoping Bob will finally recognize that his greed is going to cost him too, and accept this offer."
