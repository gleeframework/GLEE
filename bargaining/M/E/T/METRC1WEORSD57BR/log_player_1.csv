"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point""}

I'm offering Bob 4000 and keeping 6000 for myself. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and it's a good way to split the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation factor. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is the best I can get. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly bigger share given the initial offer I made""}

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, but I'm keeping a slightly larger share for myself. I think this is a fair compromise, considering I made the initial offer and Bob rejected it."
