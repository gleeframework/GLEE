"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the value of my share. However, I'm not thrilled about the 20% difference in the split. I was hoping for a more even split.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the previous offers, I'll make a new proposal that's a bit more aggressive. Since Bob's offer was 60/40, I'll try to get closer to an even split.

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a 55.5/44.5 split, which is still slightly in my favor but not as drastic as Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Considering the drastic decrease in the value of Bob's share due to inflation, I'm starting to get a bit concerned about the long-term value of my share. However, I still want to aim for a more even split.

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's getting closer to an even split and the value of Bob's share is decreasing rapidly.
