"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide it fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed towards Alice. While it seems like a lot of money now, the inflation will hit me harder than her. I need to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you'd like a larger share, but that offer isn't fair given the inflation rate. Let's meet closer to the middle.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'll take a bit less, but still need a larger share 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but this is still too heavily weighted in her favor.  The inflation is working in my favor over time, so I need to remain patient and aim for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""This offer acknowledges the inflation and provides a more balanced outcome for both of us. Let's close this deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hitting me hard, I'll meet you closer, but still need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is finally feeling the pressure of the inflation, but this offer is still not good enough.  I need to hold firm and aim for an even closer split. While the value of the money is decreasing, getting a larger portion is crucial at this point."

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5100,
