"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the money, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a bit more for me 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth even less now. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd like to get a bit more for myself, considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a decent amount, hoping that he'll accept and we can end the game before the value of the money decreases too much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of my gain is decreasing rapidly. I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd like to get a bit more for myself, considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal, but I'll have to be careful not to wait too long."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:
