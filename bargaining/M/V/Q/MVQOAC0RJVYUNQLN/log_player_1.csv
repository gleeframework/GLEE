Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, but I want to see how Bob responds. It's important to note that with inflation, the value of money decreases with each round. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer in the first round to avoid the potential of losing more money later on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more money, Bob's offer is fair and accepting it means I avoid the risk of inflation further decreasing the value of my share.  Even with the 20% decrease, 500,000 is a significant amount of money."
