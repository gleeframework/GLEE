I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor, knowing that the money will be worth less in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm increasing my share slightly, hoping to entice Bob into accepting.  The inflation means he'll be getting slightly less than 4500 in real terms, so it's a good deal for him."
