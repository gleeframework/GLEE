"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55/45 in my favor.  It's a fair compromise considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

""alice_gain"": 62,
""bob_gain"": 38,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out for both of us.  My offer is now 62/38.  It's getting less appealing for you with each round, don't you think?""

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to compromise a little more.  Let's split it 60/40 in my favor. It's a fair deal considering the time is ticking away, and we both stand to lose more if we continue. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate and the value of his potential gains is plummeting. While a 60/40 split in my favor is ideal, accepting a 40/60 split now would be a terrible deal.  I need to hold firm and continue pushing for a better outcome."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to give you 35% if you accept this offer.  This is a fair compromise, and we can avoid both losing everything. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky one.  Bob is offering what I asked for last round, BUT the value for him has significantly decreased. I need to hold my nerve. It's risky, but I think I can get him to offer more than 35% due to the rapid devaluation of his potential winnings."
