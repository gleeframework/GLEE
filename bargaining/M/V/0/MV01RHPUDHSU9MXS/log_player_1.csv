"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, and Bob is taking a slightly bigger share. My gain of 4000 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'll reject this offer, hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I need to keep some for myself!""
}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share, but keeping a bit more for myself, hoping to find a mutually acceptable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! My gain of 3500 is now worth 27.1% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of 6500 is worth 94.74% of what it was in the first round.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer, hoping to get something out of the deal.
