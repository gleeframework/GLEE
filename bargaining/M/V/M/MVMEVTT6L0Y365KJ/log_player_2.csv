Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 'good deal' was still in your favor, let's try this instead 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is hurting Bob badly. While getting $440,000 seems better than nothing, Alice is unlikely to offer more unless Bob shows even more desperation.  Holding out might force Alice to give a better offer in a later round, even if it risks getting nothing."

# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming critical. While not ideal, taking $450,000 now is better than risking getting nothing in the remaining rounds. Alice seems to be playing hardball, and Bob's negotiating position weakens with each passing round."
