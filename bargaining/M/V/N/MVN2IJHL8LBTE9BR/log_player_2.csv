Alice's offer:

Let's see if we can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}

I'm going for a slightly more even split. Hopefully, Alice will see the value in a more equitable distribution."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is still quite lopsided, and with inflation, the value of my potential gain is diminishing. I'm willing to wait and see if we can come to a more mutually beneficial arrangement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
```

This time I'm proposing a completely even split. I think this is a fair and reasonable solution, especially as the value of the money continues to decline with inflation.  Let's see if Alice will accept it."
