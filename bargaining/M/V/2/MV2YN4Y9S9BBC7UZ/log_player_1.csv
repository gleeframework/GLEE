"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% of the total, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me taking $8,000 and Bob taking $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it evenly 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4,500.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I'd like to aim for a higher gain, considering the reduced value due to inflation. I'll wait for a new proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $5,400. Considering the reduced value, I'll propose a slightly higher gain:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close to my target, I'll meet you at 6000 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 is now worth 72.9% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $4,364.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept the offer because it's a good compromise, and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next round."
