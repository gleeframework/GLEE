"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll get a bit more""}\n\n### 

In this offer, Alice proposes to take $60 and leave $40 for Bob, with a message suggesting that this division is fair but slightly in her favor. The game's rules imply that each subsequent round decreases the value of the money, which may influence the players' decisions in accepting or rejecting offers as the game progresses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but waiting longer hurts you more than me. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Alice rejects Bob's offer of $35 for her and $65 for him. Given the decreasing value of money due to inflation, Alice might be motivated to try and secure a better deal in subsequent rounds, despite the risk of further devaluation. Her decision to reject indicates she believes she can negotiate a more favorable division or is willing to risk further rounds to try and achieve a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll reduce my share a bit, but I still think I deserve more""}\n\nIn this new offer, Alice proposes to take $58 and leave $42 for Bob, slightly adjusting her initial demand downwards in an attempt to reach a compromise. Her message indicates a willingness to negotiate but still emphasizes her belief that she deserves a larger share. The impact of inflation on the value of money may prompt Alice and Bob to seek an agreement sooner rather than later to minimize their losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This seems like a fair compromise, Alice.  Every round that passes makes the deal worse for both of us, especially you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlice rejects Bob's offer of $40 for her and $60 for him in Round 4. Despite the increasing pressure from inflation, which has now reduced the value of her potential gain by 48.8% compared to the first round, Alice is still holding out for a better deal. Her decision to reject indicates a belief that she can negotiate a more favorable division or a willingness to endure further rounds of negotiation, despite the escalating cost of delay. The difference in how inflation affects Alice and Bob adds a layer of strategic complexity, as Alice is under more pressure to conclude the negotiation sooner due to her higher rate of loss."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get more. Inflation is hurting me more than you""}\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $55 and leave $45 for Bob, continuing to seek a compromise but emphasizing her belief that she deserves a larger share. Her message explicitly mentions the uneven impact of inflation, highlighting the greater pressure she is under due to her larger loss rate. By pointing this out, Alice aims to create a sense of urgency and fairness in her proposal, encouraging Bob to accept before further rounds diminish the value of the money even more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is the best offer you'll get.  We're running out of time, and the inflation is only getting worse. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn this response, Alice decides to accept Bob's offer of $45 for her and $55 for him in Round 6. Given the severe impact of inflation, which has now reduced the value of her potential gain by 67.23% compared to the first round, Alice likely feels that further negotiation would only lead to diminishing returns. Bob's message emphasizing that this is the best offer she'll get, combined with the looming deadline and the increasing cost of delay, seems to have persuaded Alice to settle for this division. By accepting, Alice secures a share of the money, albeit less than she initially sought, rather than risking the possibility of getting nothing if the negotiation fails to reach an agreement within the 12-round limit."
