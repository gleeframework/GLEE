"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively generous offer considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try to get more 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite aggressive, considering I'm already giving up 40% in the first round. Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for myself""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 55% of the current value of the money, which is a bit more aggressive than my initial offer. Let's see if he'll accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'm not going to give you a good deal 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out! With the money worth 14.26% less than the initial amount, I'll have to be even more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the money is worth even less now.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
 ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's split it 50/50 and be done with it""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a more equal distribution, but I'm still hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally settle the deal."
