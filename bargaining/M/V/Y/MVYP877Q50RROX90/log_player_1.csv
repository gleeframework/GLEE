"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 40 dollars and keeping 60 dollars for myself. I'm trying to be generous, but also want to make sure I get a good share. The message ""Let's be fair!"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be realistic. I make you a counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal, even considering the inflation. Since the money is worth 20% less now, Bob's offer of 40 dollars is actually equivalent to around 32 dollars in the original value. I'm hoping to get a better share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""}\n\nI'm offering Bob 45 dollars and keeping 55 dollars for myself. Since the money is worth 20% less now, this offer is actually equivalent to around 44 dollars for Bob and 44 dollars for me in the original value. I'm trying to find a compromise and meet Bob halfway, hoping he'll accept this offer. The message ""Meet me in the middle?"" is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's better for both of us to settle now before inflation eats away more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because I think it's the best deal I can get at this point. Considering the inflation, Bob's offer of 45 dollars is actually equivalent to around 23 dollars in the original value. However, if I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. Bob's message suggests that this is his final offer, so I'm worried that if I reject it, he might not be willing to make another offer. I'd rather accept this offer and get something rather than risk getting nothing or a worse deal in the next round."
