"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation to negatively impact Bob more heavily in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This is a fair split considering the inflation rate.  While I would have preferred a larger share, accepting this offer means I get at least half of the money while avoiding the risk of losing even more due to inflation in future rounds."
