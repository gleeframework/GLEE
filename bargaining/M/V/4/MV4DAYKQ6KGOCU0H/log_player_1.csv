I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  Let's see if he takes it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me, and the inflation factor is starting to make a real difference.  I need to push for a better deal.  Let's see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to split the difference with Bob, but I'm still keeping a larger share.  The inflation is hurting him more than me, so I'll see if he'll accept this."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse, but my share is still too low. I'm determined to get a better deal, even with the growing inflation. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to stick with a similar offer as before, slightly reducing my share to see if Bob will finally come around. The inflation is really hitting him hard now, so hopefully he'll see the value in accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not good enough for me, even with the significant inflation he's facing.  I'm determined to get a better deal, and with 6 rounds left, I'm not giving up!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to try and meet Bob halfway,  but I'm still holding out for a better deal. The inflation is definitely affecting him more than me, but we're both losing money at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is finally an even split!  The inflation is really starting to hurt both of us, and this seems like the best outcome at this point. Let's end this game before we both lose everything."
