"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's split it 90/10 in my favor.  It's a good deal, I think you'll agree! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to accept, the offer is incredibly lopsided. It's only the first round and the value of the money will decrease significantly if I reject and propose a counter-offer.  I'll take a chance and see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. A 60/40 split is a more equitable division.  It's a good starting point for us to work with.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again.  I'm willing to go down to 7000 for me, and 3000 for you.  It's still a good deal, especially considering inflation.  Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While it's still not ideal, accepting this offer is the best choice considering inflation.  The value of my potential gains in future rounds is significantly lower, and Alice's offer, while not great, at least guarantees me some money."
