**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and the inflation is working in my favor.  While my potential gains are shrinking, his are shrinking much faster. It's worth seeing if I can get him to offer a larger share in the next round, even if it means settling for a slightly smaller amount overall."
