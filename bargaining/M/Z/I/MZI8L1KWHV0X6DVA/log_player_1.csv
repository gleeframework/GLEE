"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for a better proposal that takes into account the inflation factor. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll adjust my proposal to reflect the reduced value of the money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 42-58 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous enough, I'll take the 80% 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is taking a toll!

I'll reject this offer. Bob is trying to take a huge chunk of the remaining money, and I'm not comfortable with that. I'd rather wait for a more balanced proposal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the further reduction in value due to inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 315000,
  ""bob_gain"": 685000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a fair split, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering a 31.5-68.5 split, which is a bit more skewed towards Bob, but still a reasonable compromise considering the circumstances."
