"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll get a decent amount too.  Think of it as an investment in our future negotiations! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While 1000$ is something, it's significantly less than what I could potentially get if I reject and propose a more even split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. Fair is fair, and this way we both get a good amount.""
