Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice.  Let's end this now before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation is hurting Bob more:**  With each round, Bob's potential gains decrease significantly due to the 20% inflation. This makes him more likely to accept a deal as time goes on.
* **Future uncertainty:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee Bob will offer me a better deal in the next round. He might become even more desperate and offer a much smaller amount.
* **Guaranteed gain:** Accepting this offer guarantees me $450,000. Rejecting it risks getting a lower amount later, or even reaching a stalemate where we both get nothing.

While I could hold out hope for a better deal, the risk associated with it outweighs the potential reward at this stage of the game."
