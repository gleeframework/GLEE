"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I get 60% of the original $100, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll consider the effective gains as follows:

My gain: 40% of $100 * 0.8 = $32
Bob's gain: 60% of $100 * 0.8 = $48

I'll accept Bob's offer. 

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
