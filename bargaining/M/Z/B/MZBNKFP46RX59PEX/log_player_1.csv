Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 55 this time, Alice. It's a fair split considering the inflation we're facing. Let's end this game on a good note. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
