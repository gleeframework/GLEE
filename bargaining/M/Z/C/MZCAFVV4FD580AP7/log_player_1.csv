"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Since the money is losing value, I believe this is a fair split that recognizes the changing value of the reward. Let's end the game and divide the money now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
