"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 55/45, more in my favor this time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,
""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, my turn, and the clock is ticking. I'll come down a little, but this is as low as I'm willing to go.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn again, and the pressure's on. I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is being too greedy and taking advantage of the inflation. While the money is losing value, accepting his offer at this stage would mean settling for significantly less than my initial proposal. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be steamrolled."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Okay, Bob, let's be realistic.  I'm meeting you in the middle.  Take it or leave it - we're running out of time!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a firmer stance. Inflation's hitting you harder, so I think this is fair. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  The inflation is really hurting me now.  While Bob's offer is far from ideal, it's better to get something than nothing.  If I reject this offer, there's a high chance I'll end up with even less in the remaining rounds. Bob knows the pressure is on me and is unlikely to budge much."
