Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage.  While my offers are losing value, hers remain the same. It's better to hold out and see if I can get her to offer at least a 4500/5500 split in the next round.  The risk is that if I reject this offer, she might offer even less in the next round. However, she also seems to be getting frustrated, so there's a chance she'll be more willing to compromise."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4750,
""alice_gain"": 5250,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you win.  Let's wrap this up.  This is my final offer.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to concede a bit more.  Holding out further is too risky.  Alice is unlikely to offer anything better than this, and the inflation is eating into my potential gains with each round. This offer is slightly in her favor, but significantly better than her last offer to me."
