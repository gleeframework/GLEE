I'm proposing a 60/40 split in your favor, Alice.  Let's see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm still aiming for a majority of the money, but acknowledging the inflation.  I'm offering 5500 for myself, and 4500 for Bob.  Hopefully, this is more appealing than his previous offer."
