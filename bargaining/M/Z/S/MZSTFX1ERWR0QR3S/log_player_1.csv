"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, as I believe it's a fair starting point considering the inflation disadvantages Bob will face in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the 50/50 split is a fair compromise given the inflation factor and the limited rounds.  Accepting this offer ensures we both receive something."
