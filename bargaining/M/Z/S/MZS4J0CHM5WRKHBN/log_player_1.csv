"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than before, so the 4000 I would get now is equivalent to 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44 in the first round. That's a good chunk of change!

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
