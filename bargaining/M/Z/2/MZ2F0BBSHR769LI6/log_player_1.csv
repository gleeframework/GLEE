"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less, my gain is now effectively 4800.

I'll reject this offer since it's not as favorable as my previous one.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than in the previous round, so it's 20% of 4800, which is 960, less than 4800. So, my gain is now 3840.

I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain is now worth 51.2% of 6000, which is 3060.

Comparing this to Bob's offer, I'll accept his offer since it's slightly more favorable to me.
