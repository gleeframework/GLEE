Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll consider the actual amount I'll get from Bob's offer:

$450,000 * 0.95 = $427,500

I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
