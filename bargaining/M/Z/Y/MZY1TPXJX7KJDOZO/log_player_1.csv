"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That wasn't a fair offer, Alice. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 60/40 split in your favor.  I'm being generous, but the value decreases every round. Time is literally money! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
