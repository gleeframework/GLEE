Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more strategic now.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll need to think about the actual value I'll get. 

I'll reject this offer. 

```

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A more realistic offer, considering the value decrease""

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."

# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of my potential earnings!
