Let's start with a fair and even split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 46, ""bob_gain"": 54}
```

I'm going to slightly increase my share, but still offer a fairly even split.  We're both losing money with each round, so I think this is the best way to ensure we both get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Bob is getting increasingly greedy. While it would be good to secure something, it's still too early to accept a deal that disadvantages me so much.  I'll keep trying to negotiate a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 44, ""bob_gain"": 56}
```

I'll keep increasing my offer by a small amount each round to try to get closer to a compromise. Inflation is really starting to hurt, so I need to start getting something soon."
