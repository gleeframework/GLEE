"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to share, it's only fair that I get a larger share for taking the risk of the next round. Let's reach a fair agreement and avoid the inflation hit! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
