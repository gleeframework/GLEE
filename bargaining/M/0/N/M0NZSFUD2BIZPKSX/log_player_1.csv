"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80, you take 20. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money, which is a relatively generous starting point, and leaving 20% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's be realistic 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so the actual amount I'd get from Bob's offer is:

$10 x 0.95 (95% of the original value) = $9.50

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm not sure if I can do better. I'll accept this offer for now.
