"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer, as the first mover. This is a risky strategy, but if Bob rejects, it will be his turn to propose and I'll have a better idea of his risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a much fairer offer than my initial proposal, and it ensures I receive a significant amount of money. While the inflation makes Bob's share worth slightly less, it's still a good deal for both of us."
