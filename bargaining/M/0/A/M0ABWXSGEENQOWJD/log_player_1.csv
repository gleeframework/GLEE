# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting our gains differently, I need to be more strategic.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now. I'd rather not give him a 20% advantage in the first two rounds. My goal is to maximize my share, and I think I can do better.
