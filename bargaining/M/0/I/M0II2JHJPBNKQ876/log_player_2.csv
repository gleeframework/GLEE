"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe a 70/30 split reflects the advantage I have with the faster inflation rate.

# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. I'm willing to move closer to the middle ground, but 60/40 still doesn't feel quite balanced given the inflation rate. How about 65/35? 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction, but the deal still heavily favors her.  While the money is losing value quickly, holding out for a better offer in the next few rounds is worth the risk."

""alice_gain"": 550000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm holding firm at 60/40.  The inflation rate is working heavily against me. You're getting a great deal considering the money will be worth significantly less for you soon if we don't agree. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this is likely the best offer I'll get at this point.  

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point, and the money is losing value rapidly with each round.
* **Alice's Stance:** She seems firm on the 60/40 split. 
* **Future Uncertainty:** Holding out for a slightly better deal (e.g., 55/45) is very risky. If Alice doesn't budge, we risk getting to the final rounds where even a 50/50 split would be worth significantly less.

It's better to take a decent deal now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later."
