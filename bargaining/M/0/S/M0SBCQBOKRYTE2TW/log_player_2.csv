It's a good start, but I'd like to see if I can get a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I believe 60/40 is a more equitable split considering the potential for future inflation.  Let's work together to ensure a fair outcome."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, let's split it 55:45 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
The inflation is starting to bite, and while I'd still like a bigger share, this is a reasonable compromise.  Let's end this game."
