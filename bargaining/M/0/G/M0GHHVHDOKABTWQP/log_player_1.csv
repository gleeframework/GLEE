"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the money 60-40 in my favor, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is better, let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less in the second round, my proposed gain of $600,000 is now worth $480,000, and Bob's proposed gain of $400,000 is now worth $320,000.

Considering Bob's revised offer, I think it's a fairer split, and I'd rather not risk going further into the game with decreasing returns. I'll accept Bob's offer.
