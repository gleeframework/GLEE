"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we're done!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is 20% of the total amount. I'm keeping $80, which is 80% of the total amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $40 is now worth 16% of the original $100, which is $16.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'll consider it. Since I'm getting less than I wanted, I'll decide to reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 16% of the original $100, which is $16. I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""Let's make a fair split!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but still not there 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $30 is now worth 30% of the original $100, which is $30. However, considering the inflation, I should actually calculate it as 30% of the current value of $80 (since the money is worth 20% less in the second round and 48.8% less in the fourth round), which is $24. 

I'll decide to accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
