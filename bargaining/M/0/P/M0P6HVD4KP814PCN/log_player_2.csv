Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm being practical 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing, I need to show Alice I'm not going to accept a bad deal just because of the shrinking pot.  There's a chance she'll offer something better in the next round, especially if she senses desperation on my end."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time's running out for you, I'm taking more 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision, but with the inflation rapidly eroding my gains, I'm in a difficult position.  Waiting any longer means the offer will only get worse for me. Accepting a 35/65 split now is better than risking an even lower offer, or even walking away with nothing if we don't agree in the end."
