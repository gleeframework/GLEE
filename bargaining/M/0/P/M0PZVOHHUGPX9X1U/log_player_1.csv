This is a classic game theory scenario! I'm going for a very aggressive first offer, hoping to secure almost the entire pot.  Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would love to get more money, I'm aware that the inflation is working against me.  If I reject this offer, I risk a situation where Bob gets more in the next round, and the inflation will continue to work against me.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome in this scenario."
