"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too lopsided. Let's be fair - I take a slightly larger share acknowledging the risk I'm taking by rejecting your initial offer, and we both walk away with a good amount. Deal? 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
