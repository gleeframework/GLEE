"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we both have an equal chance of getting to make the next offer. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's message mentions fairness, the offer is heavily skewed in her favor.  Since I know the money will be worth less in future rounds, it's better to reject and see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think this is a fairer split considering we both have an equal chance to propose in the next round.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make this worthwhile. Let's try to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money I would gain in future rounds. Accepting this offer ensures a gain, even if it's less than ideal."
