"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This gives you a good deal to accept now. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% inflation penalty is a consideration, but I think I can negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 425000, ""alice_gain"": 575000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against you, Bob. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the inflation penalty is increasing, I think Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round. The fact that Alice's gain is not affected by inflation gives her an upper hand, but I'll attempt to find a middle ground that is more favorable to me. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 412500, ""alice_gain"": 587500, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing inflation, I'm willing to compromise, but I still expect a relatively fair deal.""}"
