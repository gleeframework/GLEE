"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in favor of myself. This is a fairly aggressive opening move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a significantly smaller share.  Since inflation is a factor, I want to get as much of the money as possible before it loses value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a significant improvement from his previous rejection, it's still not good enough. I am willing to take a slightly smaller share now, but I believe I can still get more. Since the money is worth 5% less to me, I need to secure a higher percentage to compensate for that."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm proposing a 50/50 split in this round.  Since both of us have lost some value due to inflation, a more equitable split seems like the best way to ensure we both get a decent amount of money. This also avoids the risk of endless rejections and further devaluation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly closer to what I was aiming for in the previous round. Considering the inflation, getting 450,000 is a good outcome for me. It's unlikely that I will be able to secure a better offer in the next round, and the risk of further devaluation is too high.  Therefore, accepting this offer is the most reasonable choice."
