"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a bit more for being the first to propose.""
}

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still leave you with a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I'd gain in this round are:

* My gain: $4,000 / 0.8 = $5,000 (since my gain is worth 20% less)
* Bob's gain: $6,000 / 0.9 = $6,667 (since Bob's gain is worth 10% less)

I'm not sure if I want to accept an offer that leaves me with a lower amount in real terms. I'll reject this offer.
