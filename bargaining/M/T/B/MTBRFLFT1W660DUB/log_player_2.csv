"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly, it's a good starting point!

It's tempting to split it fairly, but I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more equitable, considering my expertise in negotiation.  Let's get this deal done!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer my previous offer, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting. This offer is better than the 40/60 split, and the inflation is starting to bite. Let's take it."
