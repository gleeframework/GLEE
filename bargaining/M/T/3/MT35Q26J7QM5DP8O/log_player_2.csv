Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, rejecting the offer and hoping for a better deal in the next round is incredibly risky. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of Bob's share has eroded significantly. Accepting $300,000 now is still better than a potentially worse offer next round when the value will diminish even further.
* **Alice's Strong Position:** Alice knows time is on her side and has been consistently making offers that favor her. There's a high chance her offers will only get worse for Bob.

While not ideal, accepting the current offer cuts Bob's losses and ensures he gets something out of the deal."
