"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point for the negotiation. The message ""Let's divide fairly"" is a friendly suggestion to encourage Bob to accept the offer and end the game quickly, minimizing the loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. I'm offering you a bit less, but I believe it's still fair considering the inflation we need to factor in. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. The 55-45 split in Bob's favor is less favorable to me than my initial offer, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to try to get a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the inflation that has affected the value of the money for both of us. Considering that the money I gain is now worth 5% less for the second time (totaling a 10% decrease from the original value) and for Bob, it's worth 20% less for the second time (totaling a 40% decrease from the original value), I'll adjust my offer accordingly.\nMy new offer will reflect these changes, aiming to find a middle ground that considers the devaluation of the money for both parties.\n{""alice_gain"": 525000, ""bob_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nThis offer of a 52.5-47.5 split slightly adjusts my initial proposal to account for the inflation both of us have experienced, still aiming for a relatively fair division that both parties might find acceptable, given the circumstances."
