Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  I rejected your offer because it heavily favored you in light of the inflation. A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to settle this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
