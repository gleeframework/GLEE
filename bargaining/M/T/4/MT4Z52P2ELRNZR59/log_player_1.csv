Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be more equitable this round.  I propose a 55/45 split. Take this offer while it's still worth your while, as the value decreases with each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
