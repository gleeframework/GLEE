{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be more equitable this round.  I propose a 55/45 split. Take this offer while it's still worth your while, as the value decreases with each round.""}

# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a good share. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly.  The value is decreasing for me each round, so let's be practical. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
