I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, considering I'm making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, it's better to take the 50/50 split now. If I reject, the money will be worth less in the next round, and I'm not sure Bob will offer me a better deal."
