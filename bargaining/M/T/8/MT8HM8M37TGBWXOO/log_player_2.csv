"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being fair, but I want the majority. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for Bob! While getting something is better than nothing, Alice's offer is far too skewed in her favor.  There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a more equitable split that reflects the time pressure we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile.  Let's get this done before the value drops further! 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to move in the right direction, but it's still not a good deal for me.  The longer this goes on, the more she's motivated to avoid getting nothing. I need to hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and the deal is getting worse for both of us with each round. I'm offering a compromise that's still in your favor, but recognizes the need to settle this quickly.""}"
