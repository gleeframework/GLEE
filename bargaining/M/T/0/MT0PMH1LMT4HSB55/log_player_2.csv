Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the value is decreasing. This is a good compromise to reach an agreement. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. We both need to benefit, and this is the best way to ensure that happens before inflation makes it pointless. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her offers are getting worse for her due to inflation. She's bluffing about it being her final offer.  I'm holding strong, and she'll need to propose something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. A 50/50 split is the fairest way to end this. Take it before inflation eats away at your share even more.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We are past the halfway point, and Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation.
* **Shifting Power:** My position is getting stronger with each round. 
* **Fairness Appeal:** Offering a 50/50 split makes me look reasonable and might push Alice to accept rather than risk getting a worse deal later."
