**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation Impact:**  The inflation is severely impacting my gains. Waiting any longer will significantly reduce the value of my share, even if I could secure a slightly better deal in a future round.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Bob is unlikely to offer significantly more in subsequent rounds. His offers have hovered around a similar split, and the shrinking pot means any future concessions from him will be minimal.
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting guarantees a payout now. Rejecting means risking an even worse offer in the next round, where the money will be worth even less. 

It's better to secure a less-than-ideal offer now than risk getting a much worse deal later due to the rapidly decreasing value."
