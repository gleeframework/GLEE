"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair and square, let's split it 60-40""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script, I'll take 60% and you take 40%.  It's your turn to decide. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the 60-40 split, but I'll consider it. Since Bob's offer is worse for me than my original offer, I'll try to negotiate or make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is slightly more favorable to me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55-45 is a fairer split""}

Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
