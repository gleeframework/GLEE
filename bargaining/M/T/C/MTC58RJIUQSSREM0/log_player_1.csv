Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round.  It's in my best interest to get the money now, before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. Even with inflation, I'm not going to accept a 200,000$ gain. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the first round. It's still a good deal for Bob considering the inflation, and I'm hoping he'll see that it's in his best interest to take it before things get worse."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the value of the money has decreased significantly, this is the best deal I'm likely to get.  It's better to take something than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
