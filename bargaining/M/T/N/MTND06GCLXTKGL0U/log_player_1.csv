"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose to take $99 and give Bob $1. I want to maximize my share in the first round, knowing that the value of the money may decrease in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I am losing nothing in terms of the value of my share, Bob is gaining 90% of the money.  There's no incentive for me to accept this offer as I can make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm offering $90 for myself and $10 for Bob.  I'm aiming for a more balanced split, taking into account the possibility of further inflation and potential negotiations in future rounds."
