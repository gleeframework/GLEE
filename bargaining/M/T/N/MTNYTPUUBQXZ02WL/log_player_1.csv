"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving 40% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $4,800 in the second round.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a good compromise, so I'll accept it.
