"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting fair, but I want most of the money. Accept this and we're both happy! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

This is a very unfair offer, and while I could accept it now, knowing that I could potentially get a better deal later on, I'm going to take a risk and reject it.  I'm hoping Alice will come to her senses and realize that we need a more balanced split to ensure we both get something."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair. A 50/50 split ensures we both get a good share.  This way, we can both walk away happy.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger piece of the pie this time, but I need more than a 50/50 split. Accept this and we can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still trying to get the lion's share, and I'm not convinced that this offer is any better than the last one. While I could use the money now, I still believe we can reach a more equitable solution.  I'll keep negotiating for a fairer split."
