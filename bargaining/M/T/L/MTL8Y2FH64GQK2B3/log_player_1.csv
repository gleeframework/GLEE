"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept this and we can move on!""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the $100, and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation, let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather get a slightly larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split the remaining difference. It's still a fair deal, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept this time."
