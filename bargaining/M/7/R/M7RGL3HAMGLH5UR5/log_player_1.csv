"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 400k. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point. Your turn! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I need to be more careful with my decision.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with a 70-30 split. I'll propose a 55-45 split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me in the middle."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my previous proposal. 55% is a fair share, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm still proposing a 55-45 split, but with the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'm trying to be more generous to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 350000

Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less with each round!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm still not comfortable with a 65-35 split. I'll propose a 52.5-47.5 split. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more generous to Bob, but I'm still holding out for a slightly more favorable split."

}
```

I'm still trying to negotiate a slightly more favorable split for myself, but I'm getting close to meeting Bob in the middle."
