"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. With the inflation, the value of the money will decrease, but I think I can get a better deal than 35% of the original amount. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\nI'm making a counteroffer that gives me a larger share of the money. Since the value of the money decreases by 10% for me and 20% for Alice in each round, I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not pushing Alice to reject and proceed to the next round. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is hurting us both, Bob. Let's settle this now with a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nAlthough the inflation is decreasing the value of the money for both of us, I still think I can get a better deal than 38% of the original amount, considering Alice's previous rejection and the fact that the money's value is decreasing more rapidly for her. I'll take the risk and proceed to the next round to try and negotiate a more favorable split. Let's see what Alice does next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a generous offer. Let's settle before the money loses more value.""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'm making an offer that gives me an even larger share of the money, while still trying to appear reasonable and taking into account the decreasing value of the money for both of us. Since Alice has rejected my previous offer and the money's value is decreasing rapidly for her, I'm hoping she'll be more inclined to accept this proposal and end the game. Let's see how she responds!"
