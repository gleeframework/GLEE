Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but be fair! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation, and her offers are slowly getting more reasonable. However, time is working against her more than me. I'll hold out for a better deal, but I need to offer something tempting soon to avoid walking away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and fastest way to end this.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the pressure is on.  Each round sees a significant drop in value, especially for Alice.  
* **Fairness:**  Offering a 50/50 split is undeniably fair. It signals that I'm serious about reaching a deal and not trying to exploit the situation. 
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes the need to act quickly before inflation erodes the value any further."
