"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering my loss due to inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this response, Bob is making a counteroffer that takes into account the 10% decrease in the value of the money he receives due to inflation. By proposing a 40% share for himself, Bob is attempting to find a middle ground that acknowledges his loss in value while still being reasonable for Alice. The message attached to the offer explains his reasoning, appealing to fairness and the impact of inflation on his share."
