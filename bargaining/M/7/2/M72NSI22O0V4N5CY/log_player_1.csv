"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 20% and take 80%. You can either accept or propose a counteroffer.""
}
```

This way, I'm giving Bob a relatively small amount, but it's a fair starting point, and I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
