Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you the same deal you offered me, adjusted for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4987.5 
# Bob gain: 5012.5

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases. Holding out for a slightly larger share isn't worth the risk of further inflation.
* **Fairness:** Bob is essentially mirroring my previous offer, adjusted for the current inflation. It's a reasonable compromise.
* **Avoiding a Stalemate:**  Continuing to reject offers could lead to a stalemate where we both end up with a much smaller amount due to continued inflation."
