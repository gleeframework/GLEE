"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60-40 split. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, no haggling! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $5,000 is now worth 95% of the original, so it's actually $4,750.

I'm not sure if Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 100% of the original, but I'll assume it is.

I'm not thrilled about splitting it down the middle, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with further inflation. I'll accept the offer.
