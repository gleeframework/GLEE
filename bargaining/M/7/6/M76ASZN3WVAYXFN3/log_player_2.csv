"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm hoping for a fair split, but I'm willing to take a bigger share since I'm the first to propose.  Let's work together to get the most out of this! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While Alice's message is friendly, the proposed split is very uneven. I'm willing to negotiate, but a 900,000 - 100,000 split is too far off. Let's see if we can reach a more balanced outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
