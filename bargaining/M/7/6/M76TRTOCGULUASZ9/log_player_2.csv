"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob, with a slight advantage for me since I'm more affected by inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's only Round 1, and I'm not affected by inflation yet. I'll take my chances and see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try a different split, considering I'm the one affected by inflation.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation affects you, but it's important we both get a reasonable share.  This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems more reasonable, considering the inflation, I'll take a chance for a better deal in the next round. The decrease in value due to inflation isn't drastic enough to settle for this offer yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation impact, I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly, but I still believe I should get the larger share.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The inflation is making this difficult, but a 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.  
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the significant impact of inflation, which has reduced the value of my potential gain by nearly 60%, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable offer at this point. Continuing to reject offers with the hope of getting a better deal in subsequent rounds risks losing even more value to inflation, potentially resulting in a worse outcome. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a known quantity, albeit reduced by inflation, rather than risking further devaluation or even walking away with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds."
