"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 

This is a very aggressive opening offer, hoping to secure the majority of the money right away.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I initially went for a very aggressive offer, it's clear that Bob is not going to accept anything less than an even split. Given the potential for further inflation in the future, accepting a 50/50 split in this round is the safest option."
