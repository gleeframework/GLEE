"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start with""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000. This is a fair and simple starting point, and we can always adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted to start with an even split, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share to get us closer to a deal. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'm losing 1000 dollars compared to the initial offer. I was hoping to get a better deal than that. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 4500 is a fairer split. You're getting a slightly larger share, but I'm still getting a decent chunk.""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this compromise."
