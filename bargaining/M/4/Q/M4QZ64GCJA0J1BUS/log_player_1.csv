"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! We can negotiate further if you want.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that we can negotiate further if Bob wants to try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a strong counteroffer.

I'll analyze the offer:

* I would gain $300,000, which is still a decent amount, but I was hoping to get more.
* Bob would gain $700,000, which is a significant amount, but I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to make a more favorable offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a smaller amount than before, but still a significant share of the total. The message is a friendly reminder that we're trying to find a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a little too greedy! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to make a similar offer to the one I made in round 3, but with a slight twist.

I'll analyze the offer:

* I would gain $450,000, which is the same amount I offered in round 3.
* Bob would gain $550,000, which is a larger amount than before, but still 20% less than in the first round.

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a genuine attempt to find a mutually beneficial deal or just a way to get me to accept a smaller share. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob is willing to make a more favorable offer in the next round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob compared to the first round, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to fight over it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 50/50 split, which is a fair and equal division of the remaining money. The message is a friendly reminder that we can end the game with a mutually beneficial deal."
