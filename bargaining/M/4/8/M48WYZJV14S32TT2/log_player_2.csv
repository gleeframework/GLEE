**Reasoning:**  We're getting close to the point where Alice might start getting very risky. However, I'm hoping she'll become more agreeable as the rounds dwindle.  There's still a chance to get a better deal."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give in a bit, but 56% is my limit. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  Time is running out.  While not ideal, getting 44% of the money is better than nothing, which is what we'll get if we keep rejecting offers and don't reach an agreement. It's too risky to decline at this point."
