I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, and it gives Bob a good incentive to accept in the first round.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject Bob's offer. While a 90/10 split in his favor is tempting,  I'm not going to let him get away with that easily.  He clearly wants to take the majority, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. I'll be the one making the offer next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Since Bob was so greedy with his initial offer, I'm going to try to be fair and see if he'll accept. A 50/50 split is the most equitable way to divide the money."
