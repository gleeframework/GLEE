"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, taking into account that the money loses value for him with each round. This way, I'm trying to create an incentive for him to accept the offer now rather than waiting and losing more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, considering inflation will impact my share of the money more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite his argument about inflation, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Since the money doesn't lose value for me, I have an advantage in waiting, and I aim to exploit this advantage to secure a larger share.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Consider the increasing loss from inflation""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've increased my share, considering that the money is losing value for Bob but not for me. My message aims to pressure Bob into accepting, as further rounds will only decrease the value of his potential gain.\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
