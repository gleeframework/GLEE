"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60-40, a fair start! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's tempting to accept a ""fair"" offer, but as Bob, I know inflation is working against me. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think I can do better. Let's try 60-40, in my favor this time. It's just a slight adjustment to reflect the changing value of money.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Compromise time! I'll give you a bit more, but I need to get a good share too! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Even though the money is worth less now due to inflation, I've gained nothing by playing it tough.  Alice is offering a slightly better deal, and I'm not sure I can do much better in the next round. It's time to take the win, even if it's a bit less than ideal."
