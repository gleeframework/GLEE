"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This is a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for Bob, the actual amounts he's offering are 5000 / 0.8 = 6250 for Bob and 5000 for me.

I'll accept this offer.
