Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, 60-40 is still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're losing value every round, I'm being generous with 58-42, take it before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
It's better to accept this offer. Although I'm losing more value with each round, my gain is still worth more than if I reject and risk getting nothing in the next round."
