"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. You get a good chunk, and I get a bit more for making the offer.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your split was unfair, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor. Take it now, or risk getting even less in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 55/45 split in Bob's favor is not favorable to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my previous offer is more reasonable now. I'll give you a bit more than last time, but I still think I deserve a bigger share for being the one making the offer.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll try to negotiate and see if Bob is willing to accept this offer. I've increased the amount Bob gets, but still kept the majority for myself. Let's see what Bob says."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous.  Accept this 51/49 split, or I will no longer negotiate.  The longer this goes on, the less we both get! 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nAt this point, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I believe accepting this offer is the best decision. The difference between our shares is minimal, and further negotiation would likely lead to even greater losses due to inflation. It's time to finalize the deal and secure the remaining value."
