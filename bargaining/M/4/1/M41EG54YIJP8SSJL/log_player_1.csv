"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose that Alice receives $9000 and Bob receives $1000.  This is a fair starting point, as it gives me a significant portion of the money while still offering Bob a small share. I hope Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more than $5000, accepting this offer guarantees me at least half of the money.  The inflation rate is significant, and further rounds increase the risk of losing more.  It's better to secure a decent portion now than risk losing everything later."
