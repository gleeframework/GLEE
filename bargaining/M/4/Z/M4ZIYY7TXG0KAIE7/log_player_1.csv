"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'd rather have a larger share now rather than risking waiting for a better offer in the future.
