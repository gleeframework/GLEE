"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take $8,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll try to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the actual amounts I would gain in this round are:

Alice gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
Bob gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but it's a more reasonable split than the first round. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
