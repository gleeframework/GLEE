"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 55-45, I think it's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Bob, my offer in the first round was already generous. Considering the inflation is working against you, I suggest taking this offer before it gets any worse.""}"

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation is against me, but I still think I deserve a bit more. This is my counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate, and the inflation is significantly impacting his potential gains. While his offer is better than his previous one, it's still heavily skewed in his favor.  I'm willing to gamble that he'll become more reasonable in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Bob, the clock is ticking, and every round makes this deal worse for you. I'm offering you a lifeline - take it before it's too late.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try one more time to get a better deal. This is my final attempt. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

It's time to cut my losses. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what Bob offered in Round 2. Further, the inflation is significantly eroding his potential gains, and there's no guarantee he'll offer anything close to this amount in future rounds. It's a risk to continue, and accepting this offer secures me a reasonable sum."
