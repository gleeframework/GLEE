"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get $60, you get $40.  Deal? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a decent starting point, I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially considering the inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. I'll take $60, you get $40. This is a fair split given the inflation we need to consider.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting us nowhere. I'm willing to compromise a little. I'll take $55, you get $45. Let's wrap this up. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, this offer is reasonable considering the inflation and the potential of getting nothing. Let's end this."
