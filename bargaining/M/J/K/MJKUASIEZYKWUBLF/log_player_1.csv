Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start by offering Bob a small share. This might seem unfair, but I want to see how he reacts and get an idea of his negotiating style.  Plus, with inflation, even a small share for him is worth less with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly better than my previous offer, but I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to reject it and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob, but still keeping a larger share for myself.  Since I know the money loses value with each round, I want to secure a good deal as soon as possible.  I'm hoping that this more generous offer will entice him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more and more aggressive, and the inflation is taking a toll. I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better outcome in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

It's clear that Bob is focused on getting a larger share, but I'm not willing to concede much more. This is a 50/50 split, which is fair given the inflation and Bob's increasing demands. I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept and end the game."
