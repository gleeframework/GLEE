"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, and I need to be more careful with my decision.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split, as it's too skewed towards Bob. I'd like to negotiate further to try to get a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 42-58!""
}
```
