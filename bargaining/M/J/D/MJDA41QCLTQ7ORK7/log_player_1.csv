**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the safest option. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for both of us. Delaying further significantly erodes the potential gains.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob has been consistently aiming for slightly more than half. His offer to split evenly suggests he's feeling the pressure of inflation too. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better offer in later rounds carries a significant risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to reach an agreement. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed, albeit smaller, gain now than risk losing it all."
