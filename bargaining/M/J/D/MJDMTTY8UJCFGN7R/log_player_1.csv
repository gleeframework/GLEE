"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```
I'm offering to take 70 dollars and leave Bob with 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since my initial offer was rejected, I'll try to be more generous this time.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
