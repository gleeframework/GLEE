"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it quickly and we can move on."

# Bob's message: Let's try to find a fairer split 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round. I'm not too thrilled about the new offer, but it's still a significant amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to keep negotiating to see if we can find an even better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round. Here's my new offer:

}

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but not that much 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gain now. My share is worth only 27.1% of what it was in the first round. Considering Bob's offer, I think I should take it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk losing more value due to further inflation."
