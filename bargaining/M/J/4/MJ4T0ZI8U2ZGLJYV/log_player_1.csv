"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This offer gives Bob a tiny amount, but it's something.  It's a starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's in his best interest to accept to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all by rejecting it."
