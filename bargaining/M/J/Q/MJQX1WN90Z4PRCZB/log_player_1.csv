"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a 50/50 split. It's a fair and simple way to divide the money. Let's not worry about inflation for now and just split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{
