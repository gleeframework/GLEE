"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose that I receive $90 and Bob receives $10. This way, I get a large portion of the money while still ensuring Bob gets something. This should incentivize him to accept, knowing that if he rejects, he might end up with nothing in the next round due to inflation."
