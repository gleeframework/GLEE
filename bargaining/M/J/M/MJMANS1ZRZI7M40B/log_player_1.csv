"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you 400k, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me taking 600,000$ and Bob taking 400,000$."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'm not sure I want to give up 150,000$ to Bob. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The game continues!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise this time. I'm willing to meet you halfway.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still trying to get a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. Let's split it 50/50 this time 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly!

However, a 50-50 split sounds like a fair compromise, especially considering the decreasing value of money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and split the remaining $1,000,000 evenly."
