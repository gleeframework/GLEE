Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but this split considers the time pressure and the fact the money loses value for me over time. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to meet closer to the middle, but I need you to acknowledge the value decrease. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, which is good for Alice. While his offer isn't terrible, it still heavily favors him when considering the inflation working against him. Alice can likely secure a better deal in the next round or two."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""bob_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Bob, let's settle this. I'm taking a small step towards your last offer.  It's important we reach a deal soon.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** Alice acknowledges Bob's ""final offer"" by moving slightly closer to his desired split. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a slight advantage.
* **Time Pressure:**  Highlighting the dwindling time adds subtle pressure on Bob to accept. 
* **Positioning:**  This offer sets Alice up well for future rounds. If Bob rejects it, Alice can argue she's already compromised and push for even more favorable terms."
