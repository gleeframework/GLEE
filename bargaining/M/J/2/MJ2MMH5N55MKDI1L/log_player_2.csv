Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Meet me halfway 
# Bob gain: 450000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's adjust 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is acknowledging the impact of inflation, her offer still heavily favors her. Accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential earnings due to the rapid devaluation of the money. It's better to hold out for a more equitable split, even if it means risking a worse outcome in later rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000,

""message"": ""This is a counter offer that accounts for the inflation. I'm willing to settle for a slightly smaller share to reach a deal quickly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split the difference and account for inflation 
# Bob gain: 487500 
# Alice gain: 512500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, but the offer is still not favorable considering the rapid inflation. Accepting now would mean accepting a significant loss compared to what I could have gained in the earlier rounds. It's worth the risk to hold out for a better offer, even though time is running out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 512500,
""alice_gain"": 487500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a fair offer considering the inflation. Let's end this now and both get something.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Last chance before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 493750 
# Alice gain: 506250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is becoming critical. While the offer is still slightly in Alice's favor, accepting now guarantees a share before the devaluation makes it almost worthless. Holding out for a slightly better deal in the remaining rounds carries a significant risk of getting nothing at all."
