"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets the remaining 20%. This way, I'll get a significant portion of the money, but Bob will still get a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased due to inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal. I'm hoping to get a larger share of the money in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets the remaining 30%. This offer is a bit more aggressive than my previous one, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
