Let's see how Bob likes my offer.  I'm starting with a generous (for me) 90/10 split, hoping to get this done quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

This is a much worse offer than my initial proposal!  I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.  I'll make a counter-offer then."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to compromise a bit, offering 7000 to myself and 3000 to Bob. I hope this is fair enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Even though it's a 50/50 split, which isn't ideal for me, it's better than getting nothing if we run out of rounds. I'll take it!"
