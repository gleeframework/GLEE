"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm sure Bob will try to negotiate for more!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject Bob's offer since it's not a very generous split, and I think I can do better. Here's my response:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer that's a bit more favorable to me. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
