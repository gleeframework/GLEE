Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob a small amount to start.  I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm also prepared for a long negotiation if needed.  I want to see how greedy he is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm still holding out for more. I'm confident I can get a better deal in the next round.  I know that the money will be worth less with each round, but I'm willing to risk it for a bigger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm raising my offer to Bob, but still keeping a significant portion for myself.  Inflation is starting to bite, but I'm hoping this is a reasonable offer that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 501250 
# Bob gain: 498750 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split, and the inflation is really starting to affect the value of the money. It's time to cut my losses and take what I can get."
