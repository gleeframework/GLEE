"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to maximize your earnings, but I believe a more equitable split is better in the long run. Let's both get a good chunk of the money now, before inflation eats away at it further. This offer is a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{

  ""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, given the rate of inflation, I believe my share should be higher to ensure a better return on investment.
