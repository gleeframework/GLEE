"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money with a ratio of 7:3. This might seem like a lot, but remember, the value of money decreases by 10% in each round. Let's be smart about our investments. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I understand your desire to maximize your earnings, but I believe a more equitable split is better in the long run. Let's both get a good chunk of the money now, before inflation eats away at it further. This offer is a fair starting point for negotiation, and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation rate, I think a 55-45 split would be fair. This way, both of us can secure a portion of the money while accounting for its decreasing value in future rounds. I hope you agree and find this proposal acceptable. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
