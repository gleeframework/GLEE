"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start to our game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 30% share, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a more balanced split. Let's get this game going! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my 70% share is still worth 70, but Bob's 30% share is now worth 27.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 40% share, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""60-40 is a bit too skewed towards you. I'll wait for a more balanced offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to nudge it back a bit. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway at 55-45. Let's find a sweet spot!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable. 50-50 is a fair and simple solution.  What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's 60% share from the previous round is now worth 43.8 (60 * 0.727), and my 40% share is still worth 28 (40 * 0.7).

Bob's new offer of 50-50 is a significant improvement from his previous offer, but I'm still not sure if it's the best I can get.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""50-50 is a good offer, but I'm holding out for a bit more. Let's see what you can do next.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to nudge it slightly in my favor. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm close to 50-50, but I'll take a slight edge at 52-48. Can you meet me here?""
}
```"
