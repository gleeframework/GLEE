Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very greedy offer, hoping Bob will be eager to accept and avoid any risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's a significant improvement from his previous offer, I'm still confident I can do better.  I'm also aware of the inflation factor and want to see if I can push for a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money. This is a significant increase from his previous offer, but still leaves me with the majority. I hope this offer is appealing enough for Bob to accept, as the inflation is going to continue to eat away at the value of the money."
