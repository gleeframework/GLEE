"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take nearly all the money, leaving Bob with a single dollar.  This is a very aggressive opening move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to play hardball or if he'll settle for a small amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much better for him than my initial offer, but I'm still not satisfied. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get a better deal for myself. I'm confident I can get a higher share if I push for it."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try a more balanced approach this time.  I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a significant increase from his previous offer.  However, I'm still keeping the majority of the money for myself.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation rates and the fact that I will be the one making the proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired outcome, but I'm still not satisfied.  With each round, the value of his offer is decreasing due to inflation, and I believe I can get a more favorable deal for myself if I continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still aiming for the majority.  I believe that this offer reflects the diminishing value of the money due to inflation, and I'm hoping Bob will see the benefits of accepting it.  If he rejects again, I'll have to reconsider my strategy for the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to the 50/50 split I might have been willing to accept earlier, the inflation has significantly devalued his offer for me. I'm still confident I can get a better deal, especially with fewer rounds left and Bob's offer declining in value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to take a more aggressive stance again.  Inflation is hitting Bob much harder than me now, so I'm going to try to leverage that to get a larger share.  I'm offering Bob 200,000, which is significantly less than the previous rounds, but still better than what he's getting from me.  I'm hoping he'll see the writing on the wall and accept this offer before it gets even worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With only four rounds left, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing, especially for Bob. While I would have preferred a larger share, this offer gives me something, and with inflation hitting Bob harder, it's unlikely he will get a better deal in the next round. I'm accepting this offer to avoid the risk of getting nothing."
