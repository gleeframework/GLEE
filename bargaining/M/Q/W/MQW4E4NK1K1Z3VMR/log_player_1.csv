Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but let's be fair. We both need to agree to get anything. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{

""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Bob, time is running out and the value decreases rapidly for you. Let's be realistic and close this deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need a better deal than that. The inflation is really hurting me. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this is the same offer Bob gave in round 1, it's important to consider the impact of inflation on Bob. What was worth $4000 to him initially is now worth significantly less. Accepting this offer guarantees me a good share and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing if we fail to agree within the remaining rounds."
