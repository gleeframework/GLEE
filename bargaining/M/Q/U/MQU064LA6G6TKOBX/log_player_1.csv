I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as I'd be getting significantly less than before. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
