Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, time is running out. But I still think I deserve a bigger share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot. While time is running out, accepting a deal where I get significantly less than half, even with inflation factored in, isn't smart. I need to push for a more even split, but I'll need to be mindful of the dwindling rounds."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. Inflation is hurting my share significantly, and we're running out of time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest option at this point.""}"
