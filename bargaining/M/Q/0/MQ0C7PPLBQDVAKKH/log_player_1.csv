"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that appeals to fairness. Since the money loses value for me with each round, I'm incentivized to reach an agreement quickly. By framing the offer as ""fair,"" I'm attempting to persuade Bob that this is a reasonable division, hoping he'll accept and we can conclude the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. Let's close this deal now. This is a good offer for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation that reduces the value of the money I gain, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since the money's value decreases for me with each round, I'm under pressure to conclude the game as quickly as possible. However, accepting a 45-55 split in Bob's favor after proposing a 60-40 split in my favor initially seems like a significant concession. I'll take the risk of proceeding to the next round, hoping to negotiate a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 58-42 split in my favor, with a message suggesting we meet in the middle. Given that the money's value decreases for me with each round due to inflation, I'm trying to find a compromise that Bob might accept. This offer is closer to the middle ground between our previous proposals, and I'm hoping the message will encourage Bob to see it as a reasonable and fair division, leading to an agreement that concludes the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it, the value for both of us is only going down. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money I gain, which is now worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm inclined to accept Bob's offer. The 49-51 split in Bob's favor is closer to a fair division than the previous offers, and the message suggests that this is Bob's final offer. Given the decreasing value of the money for me with each round, it's becoming increasingly important to reach an agreement. Accepting this offer ensures that I receive a significant portion of the money, albeit less than I initially proposed, rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
