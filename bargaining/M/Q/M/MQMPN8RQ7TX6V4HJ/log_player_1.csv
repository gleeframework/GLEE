"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share, and keeping $600,000, which is a 60% share for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that this is a fair and generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair compromise, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. With the inflation, my gain of $250,000 is now worth 95% of what it was in the previous round, which is $237,500. Bob's gain of $750,000 is worth... well, I don't know how much it's worth to him, but it's still a significant amount.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation taking a 5% bite out of my potential gains, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer. Here's my revised proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it, Bob! I'm not getting any younger!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a 45% share, and keeping $550,000, which is a 55% share for myself. The message is a bit more assertive, hoping to nudge Bob towards accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I think I can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains now! With the 14.26% reduction, my gain of $200,000 is worth $171,520. Bob's gain of $800,000 is... well, I still don't know how much it's worth to him, but it's a significant amount.

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. I'm not sure if I want to give up even more of the original $1,000,000. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
