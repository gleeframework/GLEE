Alice's offer:

""alice_gain"": 350000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try to be reasonable.  I'm willing to give you 400,000, but I need a fair share too.  Let's end this here. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. While I'd be getting a larger sum than her previous offer, waiting her out could lead to a much better deal in the later rounds, especially as the money devalues more rapidly for her."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and frankly, your offers aren't getting any more appealing. 700,000 is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a strategic gamble.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  By round 4, Alice is feeling the pressure of the devaluing money more acutely than I am. This might push her to accept a less favorable deal to avoid losing even more value. 
* **Strong Stance:**  The ""take it or leave it"" approach conveys a sense of urgency and finality. It could make Alice reconsider holding out for a potentially better (but riskier) deal in future rounds.
* **Still Favorable:** While 700,000 is a significant chunk, it's still a better split for me than anything Alice has proposed so far, even considering the inflation."
