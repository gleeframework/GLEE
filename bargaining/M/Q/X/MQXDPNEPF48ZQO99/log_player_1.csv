"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking the larger share but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
``` 

I'm going to reduce my share slightly to 60% and offer Bob 40%.  This is still a better deal for me in the long run, as Bob's share is worth less with each passing round due to the inflation affecting him more heavily."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer to have a larger share, the inflation is severely impacting Bob's offer.  Accepting this ensures I get something, as the rounds are ticking away."
