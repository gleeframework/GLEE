"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes that she receives $60 and Bob receives $40, with a message suggesting that she believes this is a fair division, with her taking a bit more. The message is an attempt to persuade Bob to accept the offer by framing it as reasonable, despite the slight imbalance in her favor. Given the rules of the game, where each round decreases the value of the money by 10% for Alice but not for Bob, there's an incentive for Alice to try to conclude the game as early as possible to maximize her gain's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a better deal where we both get more. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlice decides to reject Bob's offer. Given that the money's value decreases by 10% for her with each round, accepting 45 dollars in the second round means she would actually be getting less value than if she had accepted a similar offer in the first round. Additionally, Bob's offer still doesn't meet her initial proposal's balance, and she might believe she can negotiate a better deal or persuade Bob to accept a more favorable division in the next round, despite the decreasing value of the money for her. The message from Bob suggests he is open to finding a better deal for both, which Alice might interpret as a sign that he is willing to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I still believe I deserve a larger share.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, Alice adjusts her offer to reflect the urgency of concluding the game due to the inflation affecting her potential gain. By proposing that she receives $57 and Bob receives $43, she is making a compromise compared to her initial offer, acknowledging Bob's desire for a more balanced deal while still advocating for a larger share for herself. The message explains her reasoning, emphasizing the impact of inflation and her belief in deserving a larger share, in an attempt to persuade Bob to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing value with each round, let's find a compromise that works for both of us. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nAlice decides to accept Bob's offer in the fourth round. Given that the money's value has decreased by 27.1% for her since the first round, the pressure to conclude the game and secure a share of the money has increased significantly. Bob's offer of $48 for Alice and $52 for himself represents a compromise that is closer to a balanced deal than previous offers. Considering the cumulative effect of inflation on her potential gain, Alice likely realizes that prolonging the game further would result in diminishing returns. The message from Bob emphasizes the mutual loss of value over time and the need for a compromise, which aligns with Alice's growing urgency to finalize the division. Accepting this offer allows Alice to secure a share of the money before its value decreases further for her."
