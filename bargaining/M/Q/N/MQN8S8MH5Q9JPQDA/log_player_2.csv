"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair. I take the lion's share this round, but you'll get a bigger cut in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 10% inflation rate per round means that the money is worth less to me with each passing round, so I'll try to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. \n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll take a larger share to compensate for the inflation. This way, we both get a decent amount.""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the 10% inflation rate and decided to offer Alice a smaller share than she offered me in the previous round. This way, I'll try to get a larger share to make up for the loss in value due to inflation. Let's see if Alice accepts this offer.\n\n###"
