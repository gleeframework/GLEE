"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Considering the inflation, the effective amounts are:

Alice gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500
Bob gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000

I'll reject this offer because I think I can do better than 7500. I'll wait for the next round!

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","It's my turn again!

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm aiming for a slightly better split this time, considering the inflation. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll!

Let's calculate the effective amounts:

Alice gain: 5000 / 0.516 (1 - 0.484) = 9697.65
Bob gain: 5000 / 0.516 = 9697.65

Whoa, it looks like we've reached a tie! I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair split and we can both walk away with a decent amount.
