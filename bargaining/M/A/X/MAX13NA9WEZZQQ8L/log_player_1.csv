"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Since we lost 5% of the value in the first round, I think I should get a bit more now. Plus, I'm giving you the chance to stop the inflation here. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is getting worse for me. It's better to hold out and propose a more equitable split in the next round, even with the inflation penalty."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
