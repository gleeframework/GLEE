"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split close to 50/50, but I get slightly more for going first.  It's in our best interest to settle now before inflation eats our money! 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Since we lost 5% of the value in the first round, I think I should get a bit more now. Plus, I'm giving you the chance to stop the inflation here.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  Another round and we both lose more to inflation! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is losing value with each round and we're now at a point where it's worth 9.75% less than initially, accepting an even split at this stage seems more beneficial than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
