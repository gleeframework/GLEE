Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, Alice, but I need a bit more to account for the money losing value over time. Let's make this deal and not risk things shrinking further. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
