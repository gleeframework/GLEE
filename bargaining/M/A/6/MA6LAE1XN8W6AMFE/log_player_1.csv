"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can split the money quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not sure if this is the best I can get, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer is a bit more aggressive than my first one, but I'm hoping it will be more acceptable to Bob given the reduced value of the money."
