"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, seems fair to me!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%. I think this is a reasonable starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think 70/30 is a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, the actual values are:

* My gain: 30 * 0.8 = 24 (since my gain is worth 20% less)
* Bob's gain: 70 * 0.9 = 63 (since Bob's gain is worth 10% less)

I'm not thrilled about the 30% offer, but it's better than the 40% I got in the first round. I'll accept this offer.
