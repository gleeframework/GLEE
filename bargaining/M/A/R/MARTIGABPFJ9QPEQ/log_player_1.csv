"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end this quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the sense in ending the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. We both get a good amount, and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best decision for me. I'd rather try to negotiate for a slightly larger share. However, I don't want to risk getting rejected again.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 90% of its original value, and my gain is worth 81% of its original value (90% of 90%).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more this time, Bob. Take it or leave it?""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in this round, hoping to get a better deal before the money loses more value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slight discount this time, Alice. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1%).

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I did in the previous round, especially since the money is losing value. However, I don't want to risk getting rejected again and ending up with even less.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer, hoping it's the best I can get.
