Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. How about a 55/45 split? This is still fair given the inflation, and it moves us closer to a deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55
