"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

This means I'm offering to take $70 and leaving $30 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'd like to take a bit more to compensate for the potential future inflation. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Since the money is still worth the same for me, I'll try to get a bit more to account for the inflation that's still to come. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}"
