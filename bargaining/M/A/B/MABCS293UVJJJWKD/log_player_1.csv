"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,500, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is now worth $4,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer since I can get more value out of the money than Bob can.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to round 2.

I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}

I'm offering to take $5,500 and leave $4,500 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the values:

My gain of $4,000 is worth 0.727 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $2,511.60 (compared to the original $10,000)
Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 0.512 * 0.8 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = $1,971.84 (compared to the original $10,000)

I'll accept Bob's offer since it's my best option at this point.
