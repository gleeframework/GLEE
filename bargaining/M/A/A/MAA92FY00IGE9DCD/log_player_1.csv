"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with the inflation.

For Round 2, my initial gain of $8,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $6,400. Bob's initial gain of $2,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $1,900.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject.

I'll reject the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, the money I gain is worth 20% less than in Round 2, which means it's now worth 80% of the value in Round 2. So, my initial gain of $6,400 is now worth $5,120.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```"
