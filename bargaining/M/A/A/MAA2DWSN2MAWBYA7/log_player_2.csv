Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, how about a 55/45 split?  It's closer to even considering the inflation is hitting your share harder. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500
