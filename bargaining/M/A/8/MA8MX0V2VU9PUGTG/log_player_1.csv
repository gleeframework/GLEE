"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I want a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer isn't terrible, I'm willing to gamble that he'll be more agreeable to a fairer split in the next round, especially with inflation eating away at the total amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""This is a fair offer considering the inflation. Let's close the deal.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Inflation:**  The total pot is now worth less. It's more important to secure a deal than to hold out for a slightly larger share.
* **Slight Advantage to Bob:** Offering Bob slightly more than I get (but less than his previous offer) might entice him to accept. 
* **Urgency:** The ""Let's close the deal"" message emphasizes the need to settle before inflation erodes the value further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** With each round, the value decreases significantly. Accepting $4200 now is better than risking even less in future rounds.
* **Bob's Stance:**  Bob seems insistent on getting a larger share. It's unlikely he'll offer a significantly better deal, especially with the inflation working in his favor. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** If I reject this offer and Bob doesn't become significantly more generous in Round 5, I risk ending up with even less than $4200."
