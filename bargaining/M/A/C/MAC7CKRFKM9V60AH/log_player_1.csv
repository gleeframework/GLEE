"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money fairly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in accepting this deal and we can move on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split considering inflation. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll hold out for a better deal, considering the reduced value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway and we can finalize this deal!""
