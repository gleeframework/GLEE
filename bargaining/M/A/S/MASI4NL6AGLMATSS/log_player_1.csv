"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but it's my turn to propose. I offer a 55/45 split in my favor.  Consider that the value decreases after each round. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is simply a reversal of my initial offer, and now it's even less favorable due to inflation.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not to be taken advantage of.  There's a good chance he'll propose a more reasonable split in the next round as the money continues to lose value."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and we're both losing money. I'm offering you a 52/48 split. It's better than what you'll get in the next round if you decline.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Time Pressure:** By round 3, the money has already lost 20% of its value. It's crucial to emphasize that delaying further only hurts both players. 
* **Compromise:** While I aim for a larger share, I'm showing willingness to compromise by offering Bob slightly more than his previous offer (after adjusting for inflation).  
* **Strategic Advantage:** By taking a slightly stronger stance than a simple 50/50 split, I maintain a negotiating edge while still offering a deal that benefits Bob compared to waiting."
