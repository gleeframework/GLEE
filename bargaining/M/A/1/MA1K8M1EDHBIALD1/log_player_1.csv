Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose we split the money 9000 for me and 1000 for Bob.  I figure this is a fair starting point, giving me the majority since I'm the one making the first offer. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the inflation and the fact that he's now making the offer. I'll take it!"
