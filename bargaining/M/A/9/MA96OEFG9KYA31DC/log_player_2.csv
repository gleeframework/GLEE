"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this time, but you'll get a chance to even things out next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's important to consider the inflation factor.  By rejecting, I can propose a fairer split in the next round and potentially benefit from Alice's inflated currency."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
