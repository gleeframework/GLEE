  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $10,000 with an 80-20 split in favor of you, Bob. This might seem like a generous offer considering the first round, but please remember that with each passing round, the value of money decreases by 10%. Let's aim for a fair deal.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a 50/50 split. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not eager to give away too much in the first few rounds. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
