"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $10,000 with an 80-20 split in favor of you, Bob. This might seem like a generous offer considering the first round, but please remember that with each passing round, the value of money decreases by 10%. Let's aim for a fair deal. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000
