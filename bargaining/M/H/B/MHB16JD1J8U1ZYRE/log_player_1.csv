"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 55/45 split is more fair. Let's get this done before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 5% of my share just yet. Let's see if we can do better.""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 55-45 split. I'd like to see if we can negotiate a better deal. It's my turn to make the next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob. A 55-45 split is a bit more acceptable to me now. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up more than 5% of my share."
