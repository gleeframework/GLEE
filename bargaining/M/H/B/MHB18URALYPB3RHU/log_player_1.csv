"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can finish the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair offer. Consider it! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'd like to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is 1,000,000, and I'd be getting 400,000. That's a 40% share, which is a bit more than I initially proposed. I'm not sure if I want to accept a lower share.

However, I don't want to reject the offer outright, so I'll make a counteroffer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll counteroffer: 420,000 for me, 580,000 for you. It's a slight adjustment from your offer, but I think it's a fairer split considering the inflation.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this counteroffer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect in mind, I'll make a new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly larger share. Consider this offer!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 45% of the remaining amount, hoping Bob will accept and we can move closer to a resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share now, but I think this is a fair compromise. Consider it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation effect, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less, I'd like to adjust my thinking accordingly.

In this round, the total amount is 1,000,000, and I'd be getting 300,000. That's a 30% share, which is a significant decrease from my initial 50% share.

I'm not sure if I want to accept a lower share, but I also don't want to risk losing more value due to inflation. I'll think carefully and make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with a 30% share. I'll make a counteroffer: 320,000 for me, 680,000 for you. It's a slight adjustment from your offer, but I think it's a more reasonable split considering the inflation.""
