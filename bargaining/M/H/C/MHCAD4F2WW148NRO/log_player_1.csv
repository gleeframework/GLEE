"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is my offer to Bob: I get $900,000 and he gets $100,000. It's a big split in my favor, but I'm hoping he'll accept it since it's a better deal for him than getting nothing if we don't agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this is better than getting nothing, I still consider it a poor deal. I believe I can get a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to secure a decent share, but I'm still being fair by offering him a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With inflation hitting so hard, I can't afford to be too picky anymore. This offer gives me a decent amount, and any more rounds will further diminish the value of the money I receive. It's time to take the deal and secure a share."
