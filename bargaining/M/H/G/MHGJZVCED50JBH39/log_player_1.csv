"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you get 20%. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering you $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. This way, we both get a decent share and can start the game with a clean slate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. This way, we both get a good amount and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation effect.

Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, the actual amounts I'll get are:

* My gain: 5000 / 0.8 = 6250 (due to 20% inflation)
* Bob's gain: 5000 / 1 = 5000 (no inflation effect on his gain)

Considering this, I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to wait for a new offer that takes into account the inflation effect."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 20% inflation from the previous round:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'll offer you a slightly lower amount. This way, I'll get a bigger share, but you'll still get a decent amount.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm taking into account the 20% inflation from the previous round, so the actual amounts I'll get are:

* My gain: 6000 / 0.8 = 7500
* Bob's gain: 4000 / 0.8 = 5000

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share this time, but I think it's important to get something before the inflation eats away at our potential gains. Let's agree on this, and we can both walk away with something. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less in the fourth round, the actual amounts I'll get are:

* My gain: 4000 / 0.516 (48.8% less) ≈ 7769
* Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.516 ≈ 11635

However, I'll consider the offer based on the original amounts. I'm not sure if Bob is aware of the inflation effect, so I'll assume he's considering the original $10,000.

Considering the offer, I'll reject it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to wait for a new offer that takes into account the inflation effect or offers a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 48.8% inflation from the previous round:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share this time. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.""
}
```

In this offer, I'm taking into account the 48.8% inflation from the previous round, so the actual amounts I'll get are:

* My gain: 4200 / 0.516 ≈ 8138
* Bob's gain: 5800 / 0.516 ≈ 11242

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
