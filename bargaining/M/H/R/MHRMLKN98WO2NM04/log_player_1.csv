"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money and can avoid going to the next round, where the money will be worth 20% less."

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll have to be more cautious. However, I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me such a small share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I need a bigger share to make up for the lost value. Accept or I'll keep pushing.""

Round 7
