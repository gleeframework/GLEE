"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

I'm not sure I like the asymmetry of the offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a more even split, can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to compromise and give me a slightly larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 40% of its original value now.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to account for the inflation by giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal considering the inflation. I'm trying to make a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the offers so far, I'm not thrilled about this one, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with such a large difference in our shares. Can you meet me at 450000?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
