"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."

Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll adjust my proposal accordingly. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

I'm willing to compromise and give Bob a slightly larger share this time around."
