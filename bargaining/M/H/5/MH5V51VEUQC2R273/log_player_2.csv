"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

{""bob_gain"": 750000, ""alice_gain"": 250000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  Time is money, and it's losing value fast for both of us. This offer heavily favors me, but future rounds can be more balanced if you're willing to negotiate.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me. Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid depreciation of her share.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a larger piece of the pie, especially with the inflation working against me."

{""bob_gain"": 650000, ""alice_gain"": 350000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time and the clock is ticking faster for you.  This is a strong offer, and a fair compromise considering the circumstances.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Time is running out, and we both need to maximize our gains. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With only 7 rounds left, the risk of getting nothing increases significantly. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  My potential gains are shrinking each round.  While Alice's are shrinking faster, waiting for a better offer might not be worth the risk.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split, even with inflation, guarantees me a reasonable amount and avoids the potential disaster of walking away with nothing."
