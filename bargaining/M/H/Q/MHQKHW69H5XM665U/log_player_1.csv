"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the inflation that will come with more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since Bob is offering an equal split, I'm not getting a better deal than I did in the first round, but I'm also not getting a worse deal. Considering the inflation, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```"
