"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can still play more rounds if we want to try to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd be getting $4800 instead of $6000.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable split, and I'd rather get something than nothing. I'll accept the offer.
