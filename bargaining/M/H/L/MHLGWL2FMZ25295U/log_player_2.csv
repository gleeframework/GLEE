This is a tough one, but I'll accept. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value drops significantly, especially for Alice. We're running out of time to make a deal.
* **Shifting Power:** Alice is getting increasingly desperate, her offers are getting worse for her. There's a chance I could get a better deal in the next round if I'm the proposer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could gamble on getting a slightly better deal later, there's also a chance Alice might become completely unreasonable. Accepting now guarantees me something. 

It's a close call, but the risk of losing everything outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal at this stage."
