"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting off by proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm trying to be fair, but also secure a large portion of the money. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's better to take the 500,000 now than risk getting nothing in the end.  The inflation will only get worse with each passing round, and Bob's offer is pretty fair considering the circumstances."
