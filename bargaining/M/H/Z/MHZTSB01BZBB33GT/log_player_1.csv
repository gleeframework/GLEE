"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm going to start with a pretty aggressive offer. I figure I can get a large share of the money, and if Bob rejects, he'll be the one facing the inflation penalty in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm accepting. The inflation is making the money worth less each round, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal later on."
