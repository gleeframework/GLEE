I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept to avoid the risk of getting less in future rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation makes accepting this offer the best strategy.  My share is drastically reduced if I reject and it's unlikely I'll get a better offer in the future rounds."
