Bob is still being incredibly stubborn!  I'm feeling the pressure of the inflation, but I'm still going to reject this offer.  I can't let him get away with taking such a large portion.  I'm hoping that with only a few rounds left, he'll start to realize that the longer we wait, the less both of us will get."

Round 11

It's time to go for a 50/50 split.  Inflation has eroded the value of the money significantly, and I can't afford to be greedy anymore. I'm hoping Bob recognizes that we're both losing out with each passing round and will accept this fair offer before it's too late."
