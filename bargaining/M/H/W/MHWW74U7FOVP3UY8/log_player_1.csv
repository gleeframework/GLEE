This is a tough situation.  While unfair, Bob is clearly exploiting the inflation mechanism. 

Here's why I'm accepting, even though it's a bad deal:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  Each round sees a significant drop in the real value I receive. Waiting any longer means accepting even less.
* **Bob's Stubbornness:** Bob's offers have only gotten worse. He's betting I'll panic as the deadline approaches.

By accepting now, I cut my losses and get something rather than risking an even worse outcome in round 7."
