"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, and I'm suggesting a straightforward 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a better split for both of us. Let's be fair and efficient! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to stick with the 60-40 split, but now he's offering me $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for himself.

However, I'm aware that the money is worth less due to inflation. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, the effective value of $4,000 is $3,200. The money Bob gains is worth 5% less, so the effective value of $6,000 is $5,700.

Considering the effective values, I think this offer is still a bit skewed towards Bob. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in round 2. Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn to make a new proposal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I need to protect my share!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500 and keeping $4,500 for myself. This is a slightly more even split, but I'm still trying to negotiate a better deal for myself."
