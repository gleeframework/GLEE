Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","### \n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI rejected Bob's offer to split the money evenly. Although the offer seems fair at first glance, considering the inflation, I can potentially get a better deal in the next rounds.\n\nThe money I would gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, but the money Bob would gain is worth 20% less. This difference in inflation impact might allow me to negotiate a more favorable split in the subsequent rounds.\n\nLet's proceed to the next round.\n\n### \n\nPlease let me know the outcome of the next round."

I also sent a message to Bob saying ""Considering inflation, let's adjust"".\n\nGiven the impact of inflation on our gains, I've adjusted my offer to reflect the changing value of the money. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less and the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I believe this offer is more reasonable.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn again.
