"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Fair 60-40 split. Accept and let's be friends! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Let's see what Alice offers next!  I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""I think this is a more equitable split. Let's get this done!""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer. Meet me in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer my previous offer, Alice's counter-offer is a decent compromise considering the inflation. It's better than waiting another round and potentially getting an even worse deal."
