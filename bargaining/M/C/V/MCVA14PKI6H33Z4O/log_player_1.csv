"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount of $100. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal than before. Consider this! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's new offer, I've decided to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there yet. I'm hoping for a better deal!""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split, especially considering the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for me to make a counteroffer!

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still looking for a fair split!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between giving Bob a slightly better deal and keeping some value for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle. Let's end this! 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to add up!

After considering Bob's new offer, I've decided to accept it:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept a 55-45 split, especially since the money is worth less due to inflation. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable compromise, and I'm ready to end the game."
