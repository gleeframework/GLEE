"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. It's a good deal for both of us, especially for you. We have plenty of rounds left! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 
That's a ridiculously unfair offer! I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't be taken advantage of."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Alice. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. It's a fair starting point for negotiation."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. My offer is still very generous, and it's in your best interest to accept. Every round that passes makes the money worth less for you, and we're running out of time. Don't risk losing everything!  
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

While that's a better offer, it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor. I'm willing to compromise, but not to be exploited.  The clock is ticking, and I hope Alice realizes we both lose if this goes much further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this now.  A fair deal is better than risking both our shares shrinking to nothing.""
