I'm still holding out for a better deal!  Even though the inflation is hitting me hard, I'm not going to settle for such a small share.  I'm going to see if I can get a better offer in the next round."

I'm going to try and get as much as I can, even though inflation is eating away at my share.  This is my last chance to make an offer before we both get nothing.  Hopefully, Bob will see it's in his best interest to take this offer."

I'm really not thrilled about this offer.  The inflation has made my share tiny, and I'm getting almost nothing. But at this point, it's better than getting nothing at all.  I guess I should have been more flexible earlier on!"
