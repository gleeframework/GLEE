# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is mounting, accepting an offer where I consistently get less than Alice is not in my best interest.  I need to signal I'm willing to risk it all to get a fairer share.  The longer we wait, the more desperate Alice might become."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Time to be sensible. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  Don't let greed ruin us!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

After several rounds of back and forth, it's clear Alice is also aiming for a larger share. To avoid disaster, a 50/50 split is the most logical choice at this point. It emphasizes fairness, a sense of urgency, and avoids being influenced by the dwindling value."
