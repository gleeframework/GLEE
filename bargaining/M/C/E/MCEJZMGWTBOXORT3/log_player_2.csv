"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 100,000, but remember, it's worth less with every round! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} \n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 5% inflation rate is not too high, and I think I can get a better deal. Besides, 100,000 is only 10% of the total amount, which seems like a low offer considering Alice claims to be ""feeling generous."" I'm hoping to get a more substantial share in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know what Alice proposes in the next round. I'm ready to respond!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation.""}\n\nI've decided to offer a division that gives me 450,000 and Alice 550,000. Given the inflation rate, I believe this is a reasonable offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money over time. Meeting in the middle seems like a fair approach, and I'm hoping Alice will see it that way too.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay my offer to Alice and let me know her response. I'm looking forward to seeing how she reacts!"
