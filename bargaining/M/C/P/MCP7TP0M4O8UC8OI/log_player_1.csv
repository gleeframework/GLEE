Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is tempting, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation we face. How about a 52.5/47.5 split? 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
