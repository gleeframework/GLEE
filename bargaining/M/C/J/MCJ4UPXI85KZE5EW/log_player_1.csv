"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%. I'm framing this as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take half, you can have the other half. No need to negotiate, let's be done with it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth 20% less, so if Bob's offer is to split it 50/50, that means I'd get $5000, which is 50% of the current value of the money, not the original $10,000.

Since I'd be getting $5000, which is 50% of the current value, I'll accept this offer.
