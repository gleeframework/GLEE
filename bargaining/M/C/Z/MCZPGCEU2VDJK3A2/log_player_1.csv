"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a good starting point, but I'm willing to negotiate depending on Bob's response.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal. I'm not going to accept this, even with inflation.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my share to 70% but still keeping a significant portion of the money. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and I'm confident this is a fair offer that he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable, even with the effects of inflation. I'm willing to accept a smaller share than my initial offer, but not this low. I'll counter again in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still holding out for a decent portion of the money. With each round, Bob's position is getting weaker, and I believe this offer is in my best interest."
