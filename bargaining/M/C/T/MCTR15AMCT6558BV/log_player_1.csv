I propose to take 9000$ and give Bob 1000$. This is a fairly even split that gives me a slightly larger portion, but hopefully it is fair enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $7000, hoping to find a middle ground.  I think this is still a reasonable split, considering Bob rejected my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000

``` 
Bob's offer is a 50/50 split.  While I'd prefer more, it's the fairest offer so far and I'm not sure I'll do any better in the next round."
