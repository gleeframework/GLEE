"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the total amount, which is $6000, and Bob gets 40% of the total amount, which is $4000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with a 50-50 split, a fair and equal start! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure if Bob is trying to trick me, but I'm not comfortable with the sudden shift to a 50-50 split. I'd like to keep the negotiation going and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55-45?""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 48-52? 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the inflation, and Bob's offer is actually quite reasonable. The 48-52 split is closer to my original proposal, and I think I can live with it. Plus, it's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value for my money."
