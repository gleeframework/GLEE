It's painful, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  The longer the game goes on, the less my share is worth due to the 20% inflation per round. 
* **Bob's Stance:** Bob seems unwilling to budge from offers that heavily favor him. 
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Bob will offer anything better, and even a slightly lower offer in the next round will be significantly worse for me after inflation. 

While $4,000 is much less than I aimed for initially, accepting now cuts my losses and prevents getting an even worse deal in a later round."
