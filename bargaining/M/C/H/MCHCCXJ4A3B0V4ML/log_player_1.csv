Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives Alice a large share of the money (90% of the total). I'm hoping Bob will accept it in the first round, but I understand he might want to try to negotiate for more.  We'll see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very bold with this offer!  While I would have been happy with 900,000 in the first round,  I'm not going to accept a mere 100,000, especially with the inflation working against me.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try and meet in the middle, but I'm still going to try and secure the majority of the money. The inflation is really starting to bite now, so I need to secure a good deal while I still can."
