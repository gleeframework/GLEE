"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 40% share, which is a fair and reasonable starting point, don't you think?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my share of $6000 is still worth $6000, but Bob's share of $4000 is now worth $3600.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal. Since we're ""meeting in the middle"", I'm getting $5000, which is less than my initial offer of $6000. However, it's a more equal split than my initial offer.

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new proposal. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50/50 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll offer a slightly higher amount to Bob, but still keep a larger share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob, but I'm not giving up too much!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to give you some! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money in Round 4:

My initial $6000 is still worth $6000, but Bob's initial $4000 is now worth $2928 (since it's 27.1% less).

Bob's new offer is a 40/60 split, which is even more skewed towards him than my initial offer. However, considering the inflation effect, I'm not getting a great deal. I'll decide to reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 60/40 split, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll offer a smaller share to Bob, but still keep a significant amount for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up too much, Bob. You can take a smaller share, but I'm not budging on this!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm making a strong move, Alice. Will you meet me at this point? 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money in Round 6:

My initial $6000 is still worth $6000, but Bob's initial $4000 is now worth $2380 (since it's 40.95% less).

Bob's new offer is a 25/75 split, which is an even more extreme split in his favor. Considering the inflation effect, I'm getting a very small share, and it's not a good deal for me. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 75/25 split, I'll try to take a firmer stance and offer a smaller share to Bob. I'll aim for a more balanced split.

```

  ""message"": ""It's time to meet in the middle, Bob. Let's end this!""
