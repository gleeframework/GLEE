"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but still leaving you with a decent amount 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a bit too one-sided. I'm not willing to give up 80% of the remaining amount.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a deal that leaves me with only $2,000, considering the value of money decreases with each round. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round. The total amount is now $8,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. This way, we both get a decent share, and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a bigger share, but still trying to keep a balance between our gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of money is decreasing rapidly!

Considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a very small consolation prize. I'm not willing to give up 90% of the remaining amount.""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a deal that leaves me with only $1,000, considering the value of money has already decreased significantly. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round!"
