"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60%, Alice. It's a fair deal considering the potential for inflation in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $4000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is $4000 * 0.95 = $3800. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, which is $6000 * 0.8 = $4800.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit aggressive, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll reject the offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. 

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round (95% of 95% = 90.25%). I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too!""
}
