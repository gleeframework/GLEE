"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While I would prefer more for myself, the inflation means that in the next round, the value of my offer will be reduced further. Accepting Bob's offer in this round guarantees me a significant portion of the money, even though it's less than my initial proposal. It's a strategic move to avoid potential further losses due to inflation."
