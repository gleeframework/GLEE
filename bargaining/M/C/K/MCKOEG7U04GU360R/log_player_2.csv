Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal. This offer is heavily in your favor, Bob, but it's better to take something than risk losing it all as inflation eats away at our potential gains.

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The value is slipping away from you faster than from me. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60
