Round 2

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is getting ridiculous. Let's split it evenly and stop wasting time. Each round is costing us both money!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I know you're losing value, but I'm not going to give in that easily. Meet me in the middle... of my range 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is better than risking getting a worse offer later. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Even if I get a slightly better offer in the next round or two, the inflation will eat into my gains significantly.  Waiting for a much better offer is likely not worth the risk.
* **Alice's Stubbornness:** Alice seems fixated on getting a larger share and is only making minor concessions.  
* **Certainty vs. Risk:** Accepting now guarantees a payout.  Rejecting means gambling on a better offer from a stubborn opponent, with the stakes getting lower with each passing round. 

It's a tough decision, but sometimes cutting your losses and taking a decent offer is the most rational choice."
