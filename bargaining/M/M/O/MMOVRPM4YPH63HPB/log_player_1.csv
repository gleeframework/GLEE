I'm going to offer Bob a smaller share, as I want to maximize my gains.  I'll see if he accepts this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob is getting a much larger share, the inflation rate means that my share is worth much less than in the first round. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting even less in the next round."
