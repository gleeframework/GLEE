**Reasoning:**

The game is entering a critical phase where inflation is dramatically cutting into the potential winnings. While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, it's important to remain firm. Accepting now would mean losing a significant portion of the initial potential gain. It's worth risking another round to aim for a better deal, knowing the consequences of reaching the final rounds without an agreement."
