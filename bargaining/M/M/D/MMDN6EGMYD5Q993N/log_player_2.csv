Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation penalty, especially on your end, I've adjusted the offer slightly in your favor from my initial proposal. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct that the inflation is hitting me harder, but her offer still heavily favors her.  It's time to make it clear that I'm not going to simply accept a smaller share just because of the time pressure.  I'll hold out for a better offer in the next round."
