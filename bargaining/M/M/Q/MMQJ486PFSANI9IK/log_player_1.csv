"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leaving Bob with 40%. This is a relatively even split, but I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept and we can end the game here."
