Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob wants to take my generous offer, or if he'll be greedy and risk losing more in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. Even though I'm getting less than I wanted, it's still better than risking getting even less in the next round with the inflation factor."
