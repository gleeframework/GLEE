```

  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,

}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way, we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than splitting it evenly. I'll wait for his next offer."
