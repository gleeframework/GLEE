"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""My turn. Let's be reasonable. This offer ensures you get more than you would next round if you decline.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Value of Money:** Due to inflation, waiting is costly for me (Bob). It's crucial to secure a reasonable amount quickly.
* **Strategic Advantage:** By round 3, even if Alice offers me the bare minimum to incentivize me to accept (a bit over $475,000), it'll be worth less due to inflation. This round offers the best chance to secure a favorable split.
* **Strong but Fair:** The offer is tilted in my favor but still presents Alice with a substantial sum. It aims to be appealing enough for her to accept and avoid the risks of further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counteroffer. You lose more value each round, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** The 9.75% inflation has already significantly eroded my potential gains. Waiting any longer will only worsen the situation.
* **Alice's Position:**  Her counteroffer demonstrates she's unlikely to agree to a split significantly more favorable to me. Holding out for a better deal is too risky now. 
* **Certainty vs. Potential Loss:** Accepting this offer guarantees a reasonable, albeit not ideal, sum. Rejecting it risks a worse offer in the next round, where the inflation penalty will be even harsher."
