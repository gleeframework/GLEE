"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a decent chunk, but don't expect me to be generous forever.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the money, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too stingy, now it's my turn to be generous... or not. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial stinginess!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think Bob is being too generous, and I'm not convinced he's willing to split the money fairly. I want to keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but don't think this is the final offer!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between being fair and holding out for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to the middle, but I'm not there yet... 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to negotiate!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think Bob is still trying to take advantage of me. I'm not willing to give up 60% of the money yet. I'll keep pushing for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting closer to the middle, but I still think I deserve a bit more. Don't expect me to give up now!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance and make a stronger push for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not budging... 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to hold his ground!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not accepting this offer because I think I can do better than 40% of the money. I'm willing to take the risk of inflation and Bob's potential better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but this is my final offer. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to be fair and split the money evenly, but I'm also trying to make it clear that I'm not willing to negotiate further."
