Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the initial offer, but I believe a more equitable split is in order. Let's be reasonable and aim for a fair resolution. How about we go with a 47.5% / 52.5% split in your favor? 
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
