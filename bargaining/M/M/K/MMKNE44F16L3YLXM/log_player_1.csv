}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is 10% of the total amount, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. Since the offer is still quite skewed in Bob's favor, I'll reject it.
