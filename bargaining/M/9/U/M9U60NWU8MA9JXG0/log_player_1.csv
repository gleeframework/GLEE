"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This way, I get a significant portion of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount to motivate him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I need to be more cautious. Bob's offer is more even, but I still think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500
}
```

This way, I'm still trying to get a slightly larger share, but I'm also leaving Bob with a decent amount to make the offer more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger toll, my gain is worth significantly less. Bob's offer seems more reasonable now, but I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With inflation continuing to erode the value of money, my gain is worth even less. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to grab a slightly larger share, but it's getting increasingly difficult to make ends meet due to inflation."
