Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but the split wasn't quite right. How about this: I take $700,000, and you get $300,000. This accounts for the inflation we both face, but especially impacts me in these early rounds. It's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000
