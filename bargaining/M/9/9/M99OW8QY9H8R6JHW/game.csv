900000.0,100000.0,"Let's make a deal, Bob. I take 900,000$ and you get 100,000$. This is a great offer considering the inflation working against you. Don't let it slip away!",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but the split wasn't quite right. How about this: I take $700,000, and you get $300,000. This accounts for the inflation we both face, but especially impacts me in these early rounds. It's a fair deal!",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
720000.0,280000.0,"Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you hard, but my offer is more than fair. I'm willing to take 720,000$ and give you 280,000$. This is the best deal you'll get considering the money will be worth even less for both of us soon.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're getting closer but we need to find a middle ground. I'm feeling the inflation pinch, but I'm confident this split is fair: $550,000 for me and $450,000 for you. Let's close this deal and both walk away with a good amount!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, this is my final offer. I'm taking a hit from the inflation as well, but 600,000$ for me and 400,000$ for you is the most balanced deal we can reach at this point. Let's end this before the money loses even more value.",Alice,5,
