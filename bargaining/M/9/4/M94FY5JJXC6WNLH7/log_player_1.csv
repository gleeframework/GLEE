"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20 and keeping $80 for myself, with the message of starting with a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and see if we can agree on a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round. Since my gain was $80, it's now worth $64.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if it's a good idea to meet in the middle. I'd rather aim for a higher share to account for the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of what it was in the first round. Since my gain was $80, it's now worth $51.20.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more due to the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40 and keeping $60 for myself, with the message of being willing to compromise but seeking a higher share due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 45 is still a bit low considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation in the first round and another 20% in the second round, my gain is now worth 64% * 80% = 51.2% of what it was in the first round. Since my gain was $80, it's now worth $40.96.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if $45 is enough, but I'm willing to consider it since it's a bit higher than my previous offer.
