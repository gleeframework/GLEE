"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair considering the value loss. We both still get a significant amount, and it's more in line with my perspective on the risk. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
