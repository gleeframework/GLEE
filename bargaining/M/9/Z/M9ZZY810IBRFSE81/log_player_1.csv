"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a good starting point for the negotiation. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the majority, but I want a bigger share too! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 600,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about giving up the majority, but I think it's a decent offer. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
