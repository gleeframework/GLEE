"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This is a fair starting point, as I am the one making the first offer. I believe this will incentivize Bob to accept, as he's still receiving a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have a larger share, the offer is still quite favorable.  I would have to wait another round to make a proposal again, and the inflation would make my potential gain much smaller. Accepting this offer secures a decent sum, even with the inflation penalty."
