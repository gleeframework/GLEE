"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this 50/50.  We both lose money each round, so a fair split seems like the best option to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
