"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the original $100, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. However, 20% of $100 is $20, and I'm not getting that in this offer. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation, my offer for Round 3 will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60
}
```

This way, I'll get 40% of the original $100, and Bob will get 60%."
