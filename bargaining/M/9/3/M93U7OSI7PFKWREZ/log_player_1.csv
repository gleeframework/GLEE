"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the cash. You get $100k, I get $900k. Let's end it here!""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but it's still a decent offer for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money has decreased. Since Bob's offer is to meet halfway, I'll have to consider the new values.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $500,000, which is worth 90% of the original $900,000 I was offered in the first round. Not bad, but I was hoping to get more.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the best deal, but this is a fair offer. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than half, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I need a bigger piece of the pie! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value. My gain is now worth significantly less than it was in the first round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the value of my gain. If I accept this offer, I'll get $300,000, which is worth about 30% of the original $1,000,000. That's not a great deal, but I might be running out of time.

I'll think carefully before making a decision.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. With the inflation, the money is worth less and less, so I need to act quickly.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""This is my final offer. Take it or leave it! I'm not going to make another offer.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bit more than half, but I'm leaving Bob with a decent amount. This is my last chance to get a good deal, so I'm hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking a risk, but I think I can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value now. My gain is worth less than 20% of the original $1,000,000.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the value of my gain. If I accept this offer, I'll get $150,000, which is worth a tiny fraction of the original amount. It's a very bad deal, but I'm running out of options.

I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is almost worthless. I'll try to make a desperate offer to try to get something, anything.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100000,
  ""bob_gain"": 900000,
  ""message"": ""I'm giving you the majority of the money. Please, just accept and let's end this.""
}
```

I'm giving Bob almost all the money, hoping he'll take it and we can finally end this game."
