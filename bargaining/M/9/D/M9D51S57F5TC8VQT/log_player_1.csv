"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor, as I lose less value with each round. This is a fair compromise given the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
