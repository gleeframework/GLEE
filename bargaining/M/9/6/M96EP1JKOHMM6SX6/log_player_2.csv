"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm Bob, and I'm not happy with a 40% share.  I'll see if I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fairer, considering the risk of inflation. Let's see if you agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  The inflation is getting out of hand, and I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd still prefer a larger share, the inflation is a real concern. A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and I'd rather secure something now than risk losing more in the next round."
