"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 evenly between us, with each of us getting $5,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this straightforward proposal and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a fair one 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it for a moment...

Since the money is worth 20% less in the second round, I'll consider the actual amounts I'll be getting in terms of the original $10,000.

My gain of $4,000 is equivalent to 40% of the original $10,000, which is a good deal. I'll accept Bob's offer.
