"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This offer is fair but it does not take into account the inflation rate. I want to see what kind of offer Alice will make when she's facing the loss of 20% of her money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more than you offered me, but I'm still hoping for a fair split.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement before the inflation hits too hard.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway between our previous offers, let's compromise 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice is showing a willingness to compromise and this offer is closer to my ideal split.  Plus, the next round she'll be losing even more to inflation, so it's better to take this while it's available."
