"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer heavily favors Alice. While an even split seems ""fair"" on the surface,  the impact of inflation means I need to aim for a larger share in the early rounds to make up for the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, my turn. Inflation is no joke in this game - I need to take a larger share in these early rounds to make it fair in the end. This offer still leaves you with a good chunk.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. This offer acknowledges the inflation but is still a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is inching closer, but this offer is still not advantageous enough for me considering the inflation. I need to hold out for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm being realistic about the impact of inflation. This offer is a good compromise - it accounts for the diminishing value over time while still giving you a sizable amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we need to find a middle ground. A 50/50 split is the fairest option considering the circumstances.  Let's end this before the money loses any more value. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

Alice is finally willing to compromise on a 50/50 split.  While not ideal, the longer this goes on, the less my share is ultimately worth due to the inflation. Accepting now guarantees me a reasonable amount."
