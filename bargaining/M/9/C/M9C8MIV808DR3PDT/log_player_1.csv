"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message encouraging Bob to be reasonable and accept the offer. Since the value of money decreases with each round, I'm hoping Bob will be motivated to accept a slightly uneven split to avoid further losses. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, given the potential for inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the value of money has decreased due to inflation, a 40-60 split in Bob's favor is still less than what I initially offered. Since the value of money decreases more significantly for Bob (10%) than for me (5%), I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the decreased value of money for both of us. Since Bob's offer was a 40-60 split in his favor, I'll try to find a middle ground that's slightly more favorable to me, considering the inflation.

### {""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, considering inflation""}\n\nLet me know how Bob responds!"
