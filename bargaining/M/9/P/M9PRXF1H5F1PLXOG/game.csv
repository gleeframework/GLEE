45.0,55.0,"Let's meet in the middle. Since the money loses value for me with each passing round, I think it's fair to take a bit more. This way, we both still get a good share, and we can end the game early.",Bob,2,

55.0,45.0,"Bob, I understand the money is losing value for you. But your last offer wasn't fair considering we still have time. How about we switch amounts from your previous offer?  We can settle this now and both leave with a good deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
48.0,52.0,"Considering the inflation and the fact that we're already in round 4, I think this is a fair offer. The longer we wait, the less the money is worth to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than half to make up for the loss in value.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you need to meet me halfway. I've adjusted my offer slightly again. This is a good compromise considering the inflation and the remaining rounds. Let's close this deal.",Alice,5,
