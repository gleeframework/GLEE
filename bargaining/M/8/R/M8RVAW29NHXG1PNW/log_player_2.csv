"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I believe this is a good starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is seemingly fair, it's in my best interest to reject. The inflation rate is more impactful for me than for Alice, so I need to aim for a higher share in the early rounds to compensate for the value loss."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, reflecting the higher inflation rate I face. Let's see if we can find common ground.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation pressure you're facing, but your offer wasn't fair to me. I'm proposing a 55/45 split. It's a compromise, and it ensures we both leave with something worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
The inflation is still a significant factor for me.  While this offer is better than my previous proposal, I need to keep aiming for a higher share to offset the losses from inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor.  While I acknowledge the inflation affects us both,  my losses are greater.  This offer reflects that, while still allowing you a significant share.  Let's find a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting dangerously close to leaving with nothing. I'm adjusting my offer to 52.5/47.5. This reflects a compromise on my part, acknowledging the time pressure and your higher inflation rate. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While the time pressure is increasing, I still need to aim for a larger share to compensate for the significant inflation impacting my gains.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better offer to reach a satisfactory outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor, reflecting the continued impact of inflation.  This is a final compromise on my end. We need to reach an agreement soon or both of us will lose everything.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing out because of our stubbornness. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. Take it or leave it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 50/50 split is appealing due to the pressure of losing everything, it's still not a good deal for me given the significant inflation. I have to try to squeeze out a bit more to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I need a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7500, ""alice_gain"": 2500, ""message"": ""Alice, I understand your frustration, but we're both in a tough spot now.  I'm proposing a final offer of 75/25 in my favor. This reflects the harsh reality of inflation and the dwindling time we have. We need to reach a compromise or we'll both lose everything.""}
