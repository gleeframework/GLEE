**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the faster inflation on her end.  While she's offering slightly more than last time, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially after accounting for the reduced value. We need to push for a more genuinely balanced deal soon before the inflation eats away too much."
