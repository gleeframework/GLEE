I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer.  I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a fair deal, even if it means a smaller share for him.  We'll see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a significant factor. My gain is worth less this round, and Bob's offer is still fairly generous considering the potential for further inflation. Accepting this offer is the best strategy for maximizing my potential gains."
