"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI made an offer where I take $5500 and Bob takes $4500, along with a message hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness while also trying to maximize my gain. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly down the middle. A fair deal saves us both from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the offer seems fair and splitting it evenly down the middle sounds reasonable, considering the inflation, accepting this offer would mean that I effectively get less value than I initially proposed in round 1. I'm hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round or put pressure on Bob as the rounds progress, despite the risk of further inflation. Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's adjust the split to save us both from losing more value.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to make an offer that is slightly more favorable to Bob than my initial proposal, but still benefits me more. The message aims to highlight the mutual benefit of reaching an agreement sooner rather than later due to the impact of inflation. I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might find acceptable, while also maximizing my gain. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This slight edge for me offsets the inflation from the last two rounds. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the offer attempts to account for inflation by giving Bob a slight edge, accepting this would mean I agree to a deal where I get less than half of the original amount, considering the current value reduction due to inflation. I'm betting on the possibility of either getting a better deal in subsequent rounds or pressuring Bob into a more favorable agreement as the deadline looms closer, despite the risk of further devaluation. Your turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5050, ""bob_gain"": 4950, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting us both hard. Let's meet closer to the middle to cut our losses.""}\n\nIn this round, I've decided to make an offer that is very close to an even split, slightly favoring me. The message emphasizes the mutual loss we're experiencing due to inflation, aiming to persuade Bob that it's in both our interests to agree on a division as soon as possible. By offering a near-even split, I'm hoping Bob will see the reason in accepting this deal, considering we're already five rounds in and the value of the money continues to decrease. Your turn!"
