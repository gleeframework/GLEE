"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

This is a classic ultimatum game! I'm starting by offering Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept rather than risk getting nothing in a later round.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm not going to accept it just yet.  The inflation is impacting my gains more heavily, and I want to see if I can push for a better deal in the next round.  I'm confident I can do better than an 80/20 split!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to 85/15, hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I'm still in a strong position as the one making the proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is starting to hurt, and I'm getting nervous about running out of time.  While I'd prefer a better deal, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of 75/25 to secure some money before it's too late."
