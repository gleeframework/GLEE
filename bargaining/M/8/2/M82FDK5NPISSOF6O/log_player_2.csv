"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob.  Let's split it 90/10.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is a classic game theory problem. While Alice's offer seems generous, it's important to consider the potential for a better outcome.  Rejecting allows you to make a counter-offer and potentially get a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 9000, ""alice_gain"": 1000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your generosity, Alice, but I think we can find a more equitable split.  Let's try 90/10 in my favor this time.  We both get a good amount, and we move on to the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see you're not interested in my offer.  Let's try 80/20.  This time, it's in your favor, but I'm still hoping for a more even split. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the previous round, it's still not ideal. The 80/20 split is a significant disparity, and you have rounds left to try for a more even split.  Rejecting allows you to make another counter-offer and potentially secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're both losing value with each round. Let's be reasonable. A 60/40 split seems fair, giving us both a good amount while minimizing our losses from inflation.""}
