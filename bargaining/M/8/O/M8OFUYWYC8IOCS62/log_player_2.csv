"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, keeping 90% for myself and giving you 10%.  Let's get this over with quickly! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as it seems highly unfair that Alice would take 90% of the money, especially considering that the value of the money decreases more significantly for me with each passing round. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round."
