"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. Since this is the first round, the value of the money is still high, and I'm aiming for a significant share.  Let's see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to turn the tables, but I'm not giving in so easily. While I'm losing 20% of the value, the loss for Bob is much smaller. I'll reject his offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly to 80%, but I'm still keeping the majority.  The inflation is hitting us both, and I need to make sure I secure a good amount.  This should be a good compromise, as it's a significant gain for Bob compared to his previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still extremely unfavorable to me, even though inflation is hitting my gains harder. He's trying to exploit the situation, but I'm not willing to accept such a small share.  I'll make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm making a final attempt to get a fair deal.  I've reduced my share significantly due to the heavy inflation, but I'm still taking the larger portion.  This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the money has decreased for both of us.  Let's see if Bob is finally willing to accept."
