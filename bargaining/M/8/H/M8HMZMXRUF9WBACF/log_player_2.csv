"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'll take 99% and you can have the remaining 1%. 
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 10,000 is something, it's a ridiculously unfair offer.  I'm going to see if I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. I'm willing to split it 90/10, but let's talk.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to come down a bit, Bob, but I still think I deserve the majority share. Let's split it 95/5. It's a better deal for you than the last round! 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still not happy with that offer. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
