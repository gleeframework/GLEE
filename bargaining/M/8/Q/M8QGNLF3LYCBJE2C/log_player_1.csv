"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob a small portion to start. I know there's inflation, so I want to secure as much as possible in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'm accepting this offer. Even though I'm losing 10% in value due to inflation, 500,000 is still a significant amount of money.  There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the next round, and the inflation could continue to devalue my potential earnings."
