"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor this time.""}\n\n###\n\nI've made my offer for Round 2. Now it's Alice's turn to decide whether to accept or reject it. Remember, with each passing round, the value of the money decreases by 20%!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round.  Let's split it evenly this time and be done with it. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to accept Alice's offer of an even 50/50 split in Round 3, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation. This seems like the best option to maximize my gain at this point in the game."
