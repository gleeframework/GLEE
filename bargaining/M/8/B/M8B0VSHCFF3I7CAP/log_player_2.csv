I want to see if I can get a better deal. The inflation will hurt Alice more than me, so I have an advantage in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's be fair, but also consider the effects of inflation.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a better split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Alice's offer is better for me than my previous offer, I'm still confident that I can get more. The inflation is hitting her harder, and I'm betting that she'll need to make a more substantial concession in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Inflation is affecting us both, but I believe this offer is fair given the circumstances.  Let's reach a compromise before the money becomes worthless.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice's offer is now getting close to what I'd like, and the inflation is starting to bite really hard. I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
