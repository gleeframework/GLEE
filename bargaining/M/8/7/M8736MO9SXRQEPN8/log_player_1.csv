"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my share of $400,000 is worth 90% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's share of $600,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it seems slightly biased towards Bob. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, my offer in the first round was $500,000, which is now worth 90% of its original value. I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 450000,
  ""bob_gain"": 550000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation effect:

My original offer in the first round was $500,000. After 3 rounds of inflation, it's worth 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.7273 = 0.5907 (or 59.07%) of its original value. So, my share of $480,000 is actually worth 0.7273 * 480,000 = $350,000 in the original value.

Bob's share of $520,000 is worth 0.8554 (1 - 0.1446) of its original value, which is $855,400.

Considering the actual values, I think this offer is more favorable to me. I'll accept it.
