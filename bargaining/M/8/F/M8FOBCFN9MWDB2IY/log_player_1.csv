"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively generous starting offer. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, now it's my turn! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, I didn't expect Bob to reject my offer so quickly!

Considering the inflation, my gain of 20 dollars is actually worth 18 dollars in real value. Bob's gain of 80 dollars is worth 72 dollars in real value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but it's a significant difference from the previous round. I'll have to think carefully...
