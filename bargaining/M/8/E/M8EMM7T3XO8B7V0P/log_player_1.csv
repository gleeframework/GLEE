"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
``` 

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor, knowing the money will devalue with each round. I'm hoping Bob will accept this first offer and avoid any further risk of losing money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is much worse than my previous offer. The money is worth less now, and he is trying to take almost all of it. I will reject this offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000} 
``` 

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 8000/2000, knowing that Bob will be the one to make the next offer and the money will devalue further if we reach round 4. I believe this offer still gives me a fair share while avoiding further risk of losing money."
