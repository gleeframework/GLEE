"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Take it or leave it, Bob. I'm feeling generous today. 
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI wouldn't want to accept such an uneven split, especially considering the significant amount of money involved. It's better to proceed and try to negotiate a more favorable division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable and split it fairly, considering I'm losing value each round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  My offer is more fair considering the inflation affecting your share. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Alice's offer seems to take inflation into account, it still doesn't quite meet in the middle when considering the devaluation of my share over the rounds. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a more balanced agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my share's value is dropping significantly. I'm willing to compromise but need a bit more to make it fair.""}"
