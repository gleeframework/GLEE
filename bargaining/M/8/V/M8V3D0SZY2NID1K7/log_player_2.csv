**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a risky game, assuming the rapidly devaluing money will scare me into accepting a poor deal. However,  the deal is getting worse for her *much* faster. While I need to apply pressure, I can still afford to be a little patient."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. This 50/50 split is the fairest option. Any more rounds and the inflation will significantly hurt both of us.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Moving to a 50/50 split is a strategic move. It:

* **Highlights fairness:**  It removes the argument of an unfair split, putting the pressure back on Alice. 
* **Emphasizes the shrinking pie:** By offering an even split, it underscores how much the inflation is costing *both* of us. 
* **Shows I'm willing to negotiate:** Moving from my previous offers demonstrates a willingness to compromise, but not be walked over. 

It's a firm offer, but with time running out, it's a strong position to take."
