Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll start by being generous. I'll take 990,000 dollars and leave Bob with 10,000.  It's a good first offer considering the inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's offer is fair. Accepting this means we both get a good share, and avoids the risk of further inflation reducing my potential gain."
