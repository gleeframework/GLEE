Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fairer if we split the money evenly.  While the value is declining, we can still both walk away with a good amount if we cooperate.  
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer heavily favors Bob, especially with the inflation working against me faster.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at a significant loss."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money with every round. Let's split the money evenly and stop this before we both end up with nothing. This is the fairest way forward. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this point is the most logical choice. 

Here's why:

* **Rapidly Declining Value:**  The money is losing value quickly, especially for Bob. Every round that passes makes a significant dent in the potential gains for both of us. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better offer in later rounds is too risky. If we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split, even with the inflation, ensures we both walk away with something. It demonstrates a willingness to cooperate and avoid a mutually detrimental outcome."
