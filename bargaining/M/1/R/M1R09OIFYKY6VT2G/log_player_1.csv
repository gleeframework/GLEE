"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and I'll take the remaining $6,000. This is a relatively fair split, considering we have 11 more rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. How about a split that's closer to even? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $4,800. Bob's gain of $4,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is $3,800.

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a bit more favorable to him than before. However, I'm willing to compromise to get closer to an even split. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
