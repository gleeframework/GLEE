"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and get it over with?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $5,000 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44
* Bob's gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79

I don't think this is a good deal for me, considering the money is worth less for me than for Bob. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll give you a bit less than 50%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500, which is a slightly smaller share than the 50/50 split, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I think I deserve the majority 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: 4800 / 0.721 = 6666.67
* Bob's gain: 5200 / 0.8587 = 6041.95

I think this is a slightly better deal for me than the previous offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject this offer for now.
