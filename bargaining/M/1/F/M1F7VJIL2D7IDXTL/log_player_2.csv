"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I'll take the lion's share this round, but I'm open to discussion in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate the proposal
Alice's proposal gives me $1000 and her $9000. Considering the initial amount is $10,000, this seems like a significantly uneven division.

### Step 2: Consider the impact of inflation
With each passing round, the money loses value - 20% for me and 5% for Alice. This means that if I reject the offer and we proceed to the next round, the money's value will decrease, but more significantly for me than for Alice.

### Step 3: Assess the strategic position
Given that this is the first round and there are 11 more rounds to go, I have to consider whether accepting such a low offer now is better than risking further devaluation of the money. It's also strategic to think about setting a precedent for future negotiations.

### Step 4: Make a decision
Considering the uneven division and the significant devaluation of money for me with each passing round, I need to decide if $1000 now is more valuable than the potential for a better offer in future rounds, keeping in mind the risk of ending up with nothing if we fail to agree within 12 rounds.

The final answer is: {""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### Step 1: Determine a fairer division
Given the uneven division proposed by Alice in the first round, I need to propose a division that I consider fair but also takes into account the decreasing value of money.

### Step 2: Calculate the adjusted values after round 1
Since the money loses 20% of its value for me and 5% for Alice with each round, after round 1, the effective value of the $10,000 has changed. However, since we're dealing with the nominal value in proposals, I'll focus on a more equitable split rather than the adjusted value.

### Step 3: Formulate a proposal
Considering the need for a more equitable division and the urgency to reach an agreement before the money loses all its value, I'll propose a division that might be seen as more reasonable. A 40-60 split could be seen as a compromise, acknowledging Alice's initial position but also asserting my need for a better deal.

### Step 4: Attach a message
The message should convey my willingness to negotiate further but also emphasize the importance of finding a mutually acceptable agreement soon.

### Step 5: Finalize the proposal
Given the considerations above, my proposal for round 2 would be a division where I receive $4,000 and Alice receives $6,000, accompanied by a message urging Alice to consider the benefits of reaching an agreement sooner rather than later.

The final answer is: {""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground. The sooner we agree, the better for both of us.""}"
