"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to split the $10,000 exactly in half, giving us both $5,000. This is a fair and straightforward proposal to begin with. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less this round, my gain of $4000 is actually worth $3200 in terms of purchasing power compared to the first round.

I'm not sure if I'm comfortable with Bob taking a larger share, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'll reject this offer for now and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again, my gain of $3200 from the previous round is now worth $2560 in terms of purchasing power.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I need to keep some for myself!""
}
```

This offer gives Bob a larger share, but I'm trying to protect my own interests. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but I'm willing to compromise again 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, my gain of $4200 from the previous round is now worth approximately $2170 in terms of purchasing power.

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer of $3000 for me seems a bit low. However, I'm getting a bit desperate to make a deal, so I'll accept this offer.
