"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer and message to Bob in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it close to half""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a bit less than half, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly before inflation eats into the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split it closer to half, but I'll give you a slight advantage this time. Let's see if you're willing to be more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 520000,
  ""bob_gain"": 480000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, taking into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it."
