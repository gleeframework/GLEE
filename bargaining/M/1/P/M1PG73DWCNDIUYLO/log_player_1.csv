"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'd be getting $400,000, but it's worth $380,000 in real terms. Bob's gain is worth 10% less, so he'd be getting $600,000, but it's worth $540,000 in real terms.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, but I'll have to think about it. I'll reject it for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, so I need to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 420000, ""bob_gain"": 580000}

I'm proposing a slightly skewed split in my favor, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","In round 4, the money is worth significantly less due to inflation. My gain of $420,000 in round 3 is now worth only about $361,000 in real terms, while Bob's gain of $580,000 is now worth about $414,000 in real terms.

Considering the reduced value of the money, Bob's offer seems reasonable. I'll accept it.
