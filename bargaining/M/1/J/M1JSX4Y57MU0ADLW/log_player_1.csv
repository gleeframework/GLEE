I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer. I'll take a large share, but leave Bob with a small amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! I'll reject and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm lowering my own share a bit, but still leaving Bob with a significant amount to hopefully encourage him to accept.  With the inflation, I need to start securing a larger share for myself."
