"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got greedy in round 1, now I'll take more! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 70/30 split, but I'll consider it. Since my money is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about it...

I'm offering a 45/55 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to keep some balance."
