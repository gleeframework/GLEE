Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable and split it 50/50. It's been two rounds and neither of us is getting what we want. This is the best compromise and avoids further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
