Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I believe it's more fair to split the money closer to 60/40. This way, we both get a good amount and can move on. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
