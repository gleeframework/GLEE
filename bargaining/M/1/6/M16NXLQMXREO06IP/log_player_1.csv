Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a somewhat aggressive proposal, aiming for a large share. I want to see how Bob reacts and if he's willing to accept a less favorable deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm getting less than I initially proposed, the inflation means I'm losing money with each passing round. Accepting now ensures I get something, even if it's less than what I initially wanted."
