Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to make this worthwhile. This is my final offer before we both lose more to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is holding firm, but the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor. The longer this goes on, the more the inflation differential benefits me. It's time to play hardball and hope Alice understands the stakes."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. We're both losing money with every passing round. Let's end this now with a fair and equal split. 50/50. Take it or leave it."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** This offer sends a clear message:  
* **Seriousness:** No more lowball offers. Bob is drawing a line.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is undeniably equitable, removing any argument of greed.
* **Urgency:** The ""take it or leave it"" emphasizes the time pressure and potential for mutual loss.

While risky, this firm stance might be what's needed to shake Alice's resolve and secure a reasonable deal before inflation eats away at the potential winnings."
