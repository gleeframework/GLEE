  ""bob_gain"": 100000,

# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value.

```
{

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Last chance, Bob! Take it or walk away!""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, let's end this game fairly 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly. I'll consider Bob's offer.

A 50/50 split seems like a fair deal, considering the significant erosion of the money's value. I'll take it."
