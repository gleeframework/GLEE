600000.0,400000.0,Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe a 60/40 split is fair considering the inflation working against me.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable split. It's better for both of us to agree now rather than losing more value in the next rounds.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I understand the impact of inflation, but your previous offer wasn't fair to me. This is a compromise, taking into account the decreasing value.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
420000.0,580000.0,"Inflation is hitting us both, but I still think I can get a bit more. This is my new offer, taking into account the decreasing value for both of us.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
500000.0,500000.0,This is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day.  Any more rounds and we'll both lose too much to inflation.,Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,accept
