Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can both walk away with a decent amount of money.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is a significant decrease from my initial proposal, it's still a substantial amount of money. The inflation rate is rapidly diminishing the value of the money, so it's better to secure a good portion now rather than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
