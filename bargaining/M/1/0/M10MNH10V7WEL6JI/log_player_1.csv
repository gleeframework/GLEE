"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```
I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, my gain of $400,000 is now worth $320,000, which is a better deal than my original offer. I'll accept this offer.
