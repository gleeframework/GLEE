**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation for Bob:**  Bob's share is losing value much faster than mine. Waiting any longer will likely result in him offering even less in future rounds. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Even if I hold out hoping for a better offer in a later round, the continuous inflation will significantly erode the value of my potential gains. 
* **Guaranteed Value:** Accepting now secures me a reasonable sum, despite the initial discount. It's better to take a sure thing than gamble on a rapidly devaluing asset."
