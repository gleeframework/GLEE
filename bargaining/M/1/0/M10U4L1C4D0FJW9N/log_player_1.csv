Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'll start by proposing a split that is heavily in my favor, but still gives Bob something. I want to see how he reacts and if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being very greedy, but I'm not going to let him get away with it. I know I have the power in this situation, and I'm going to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm reducing my share slightly but still offering a significant portion of the money to Bob. I'm hoping he'll see that I'm willing to compromise, and we can reach an agreement."
