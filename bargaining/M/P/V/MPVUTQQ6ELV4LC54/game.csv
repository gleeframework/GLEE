,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'll take $60, and you can have $40. Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split. If you don't accept, the value will decrease further, affecting us both.",Bob,2,

60.0,40.0,"Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains.  This round I propose $60 for me and $40 for you.  The value decreases significantly with each round, particularly for you. Let's be reasonable and close this deal now.",Alice,3,

45.0,55.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on my gains, I'm willing to compromise. I propose $55 for me and $45 for you. This is a fairer split, given the devaluation we're both facing. Let's settle this before it gets worse.",Bob,4,
