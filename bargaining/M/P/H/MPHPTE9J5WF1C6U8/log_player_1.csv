"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a straightforward proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the deal, as it's a 50/50 split, and I'd rather get something than risk going to another round with the money decreasing in value."
