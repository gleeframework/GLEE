I'm going to reject this offer. While it's better than nothing, I'm confident I can get a better deal. Let's see what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2

I'm offering a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable way to divide the money, and I believe Alice will be happy with this offer."
