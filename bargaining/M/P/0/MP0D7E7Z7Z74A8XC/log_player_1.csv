Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob will accept, as I don't know how inflation will affect him in the next round.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Although I'd prefer more money, it's clear that Bob is in a much stronger position now due to the inflation advantage. Accepting his offer ensures I get at least something, as opposed to risking getting nothing if we continue to play."
