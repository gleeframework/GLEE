"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation, I'm being generous. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

While Bob claims to be generous, this offer is heavily skewed in his favor, especially considering the rapid inflation working against him. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of being taken advantage of."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6500,
""bob_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm aiming for a fair deal. This offer considers the inflation impacting us both, though you're hit harder. Let's settle this now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering I'm losing value faster, I'm willing to compromise, but need a bit more. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob's offer is still not acceptable. While he acknowledges the inflation, he's using it as a justification for an unfair deal. Accepting this offer at Round 4 would mean I'm losing a significant chunk of the initial value. I need to hold out for a better offer that reflects the actual depreciation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is my final offer. It's clear the inflation is hurting you more than me.  This is a compromise that considers the situation we're both in. Take it or leave it.""
