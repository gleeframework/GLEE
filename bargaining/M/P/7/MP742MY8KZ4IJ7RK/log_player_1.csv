"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a fairly standard 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less, this means that the value of the money I gain is increasing relative to Bob's gain. This is a good opportunity for me to try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 55-45, and the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to adjust my offer to take advantage of the increasing value of my gains.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is affecting Bob's gain more severely than before. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll try to take advantage of this and get a better deal.

However, I'll also consider the fact that Bob's gain is now worth less than in the previous rounds. I'll try to get a slightly better split, but I won't push too hard since we're running out of rounds.

I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
