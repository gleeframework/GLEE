Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. My offer is already generous considering the inflation is working against you more than me.  We should settle this now before we both lose out further. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000

{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to go up to 70/30.  The inflation is hitting us both, but I think this is a fair compromise. Let's end this quickly.""}

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  The longer we wait, the less we both get.  I'm sticking to my previous offer - it's more than fair given the situation. Take it now before it's too late! 
# Bob gain: 370000 
# Alice gain: 630000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would ideally prefer a larger share, the inflation is rapidly diminishing the value of the money.  It's better to accept this offer and secure some gain than to risk losing even more in the next round."
