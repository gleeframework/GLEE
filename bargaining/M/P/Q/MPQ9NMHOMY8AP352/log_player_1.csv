"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000 and leave 20% for Bob. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I'm not sure how the inflation will affect Bob's perception of the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of Bob's gain, I'll take a slightly more aggressive stance. I'll reject this offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation effect still in play, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm increasing my share to 70% of the $10,000, hoping to get a better deal before the next round of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to get a more equal split. Considering the significant inflation effect on Bob's gain, I'll consider this offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me, considering the original value of the money. I'll accept this offer.
