6000.0,4000.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer. I get $6,000, you get $4,000. This way we both benefit from dividing the money early.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Considering the impact of inflation on my end, I think a 55-45 split is more reasonable. This way, we both still benefit from an early division, but the slight adjustment accounts for my depreciating share over time.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6300.0,3700.0,"I understand your concern about inflation, but your previous offer was too skewed in your favor.  This offer gives you a slightly better deal than if you wait another round, and we can avoid further losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4200.0,5800.0,"Given the increasing impact of inflation on my share, I'm adjusting my proposal to a 58-42 split. This accounts for the loss in value I'm experiencing, while still ensuring Alice receives a substantial amount. The longer we wait, the less my share is worth, so I hope we can come to an agreement soon.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, you're pushing this too close. I'm offering you a larger share than you'd get if you wait another round.  Let's be reasonable and end this here.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Considering the significant impact of inflation on my share, which is now worth 59.04% less than initially, I'm adjusting my proposal to a 60-40 split. This reflects the urgent need for me to maximize my share to counteract the loss in value. I believe this is a fair adjustment, given the unique circumstances affecting my portion of the money.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6700.0,3300.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Your share is rapidly decreasing, and you're losing out by not accepting my offer.  Take this deal before your share shrinks even further!",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Given the extreme impact of inflation on my share, now worth 73.79% less than initially, I must prioritize maximizing my portion to mitigate this loss. A 65-35 split is my new proposal, reflecting the critical need to counteract the severe depreciation of my potential earnings. I urge Alice to consider the unique pressures I'm under due to inflation and the importance of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement before the value decreases further.",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, you're shooting yourself in the foot!  Every round you wait, your share is worth significantly less.  Take this offer, it's the best you'll get at this point!",Alice,9,
,,,Bob,9,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Considering the drastic impact of inflation, with my share now worth 83.22% less, I must aggressively seek a larger portion to offset this loss. A 70-30 split is my revised proposal, emphasizing the urgent need to counteract the severe depreciation of my potential earnings. I strongly encourage Alice to recognize the disproportionate effect of inflation on my share and the importance of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement before the value diminishes further.",Bob,10,
,,,Alice,10,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, this is your last chance!  I'm offering you a larger share than you'd get if you reject this.  Accept this offer, or we both walk away with nothing!",Alice,11,
,,,Bob,11,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"In this final round, with my share worth 89.26% less due to inflation, I must maximize my portion to counteract the extreme loss in value. A 75-25 split is my last proposal, reflecting the critical need to address the severe impact of inflation on my potential earnings. I urge Alice to consider the significant imbalance caused by inflation and accept this offer to ensure we both receive some value, rather than walking away with nothing.",Bob,12,
