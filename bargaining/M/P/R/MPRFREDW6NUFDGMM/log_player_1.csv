"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end this game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is still a decent amount considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not being generous, I'll take what I can get! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is quite bold, isn't it?

I'll think carefully... Considering the inflation factor, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer and let Bob know that I'm not willing to give up that much. It's still early in the game, and I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'll try to make a more balanced offer this time around. Considering the inflation factor, I'll aim for a higher percentage of the remaining amount.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle and let's end this game!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly lower amount than before, but still a decent share of the remaining funds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not meeting me in the middle, I'll try to meet you! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me in the middle after all!

Considering the inflation factor, I'll evaluate this offer carefully. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll think about the value of the money I'd be getting in this round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer. It's a fair split, and I'd rather end the game now than risk losing more value in subsequent rounds."
