"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Your share decreases every round with inflation. Let's be reasonable and split it fairly.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm losing money with every round we play. My offer is still generous considering. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 40,
""alice_gain"": 60,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm meeting you halfway now. Take it before inflation eats your share even more.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I need to make up for the inflation. This is my final offer! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting desperate, and her ""final offer"" bluffs are getting old.  We're past the halfway point, and she's feeling the pressure of the inflation more than I am. Holding out means I'm likely to get an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 35,
""alice_gain"": 65,
""message"": ""Alright, Alice.  Let's stop wasting time.  I'm increasing my offer again.  Take this deal before it's too late!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly to show a willingness to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on getting a larger share. Alice's desperation is increasing, and I need to capitalize on that.  However, there's a real risk we both get nothing if this goes on much longer, so  I need to start making more ""reasonable"" offers."
