"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it fairly. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""I think we can find a more equitable split. How about this offer?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer Was Unfavorable:** Alice's initial offer heavily favored her. Accepting a 40/60 split in Round 1 would mean I lose out significantly due to inflation.
* **Time is Money (Literally):**  With each round, the value of the money decreases.  It's in my best interest to secure a good deal sooner rather than later.
* **Finding a Balance:**  My offer is still generous to Alice, considering the inflation working against me. It encourages her to accept now while ensuring I receive a larger share than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's try 5400 for me and 4600 for you. This way we both get a little more than last round. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** Inflation is eating away at the value, and waiting any longer will only hurt both of us.
* **Improved Offer:**  While not ideal, Alice's offer is significantly better than her first one.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in Round 4 is too risky. Alice might propose an even worse split, and the inflation impact will make the potential gains negligible."
