"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, considering we both have the power to reject offers. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less this round, I'm thinking about the value I'll get in the next round.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
