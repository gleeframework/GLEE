"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob. Accept and we can wrap it up!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair split and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to divide the money. Let's end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less after the first round, I need to adjust my expectations.

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than my initial offer. However, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob. Since I rejected Bob's offer, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to gain an advantage.

Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiating. Accept and let's end this!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think a 60/40 split is a fair compromise considering the inflation we're facing. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob is trying to take advantage of that. A 60/40 split is a significant concession from my side, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I should aim for a higher share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 5, the money is worth even less for me, but I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to gain an advantage.

Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve a bigger share considering the inflation. You're getting a good deal, but I'm not backing down!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it to avoid further negotiations. I'm taking a risk, but I think I can get a better deal if I push hard."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money with each round.  Let's be reasonable and agree to a 70/30 split.  I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think it's the best option for both of us at this point. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth even less now, and Bob is trying to make a final push for a 70/30 split. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'm also not sure if I can do better.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think I should take what I can get. A 70/30 split is still a significant concession from my side, but it's better than the 60/40 split he offered earlier.

I'll accept this offer, but I'm not happy about it.
