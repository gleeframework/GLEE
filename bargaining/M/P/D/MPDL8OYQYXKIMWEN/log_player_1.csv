"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the initial amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the cash!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the situation!

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll have to reassess the offer. My gain of $400,000 is now worth $400,000 x 0.9 = $360,000. Bob's gain of $600,000 is now worth $600,000 x 0.95 = $570,000.

I'm not happy with this offer, so I'll reject it.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","It's my turn again. Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm offering Bob $450,000, which is a slightly more generous offer than before. Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns!

Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me now, I'll have to calculate my gain: $450,000 x 0.727 = $326,850. Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth $550,000 x 0.8586 = $472,13.

I'm not happy with this offer, so I'll reject it.
