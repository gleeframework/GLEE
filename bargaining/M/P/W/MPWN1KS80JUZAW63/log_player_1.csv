"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but it's still a good deal for you! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a bit more in his favor.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I'd rather wait for a better deal, considering the value of the money is decreasing over time. I'd like to see if I can get a more favorable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get a bit more than 40. This is a fair offer, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal than Bob's previous offer, while still being reasonable and open to compromise. Now it's up to Bob to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on my share, but I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share than before. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I'd like to get a better deal before it's too late. I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially considering the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and being reasonable, considering the decreasing value of money. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not going to give up now, I want a bigger share than that. You can do better than that, can't you? 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is getting more aggressive in his demands.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's extremely one-sided and doesn't take into account the rapidly decreasing value of the money. I'd rather not give Bob an 80/20 split, especially when the money is worth less and less with each passing round. I'd like to try to negotiate a more balanced deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is being quite aggressive with his demands.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's extremely one-sided and unfair. A 90/10 split is not acceptable, especially considering the value of the money is already decreasing rapidly. I'd rather not give Bob the majority of the money, and I'd like to try to negotiate a more balanced deal in the next round."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's extremely one-sided and unfair. A 95/5 split is not acceptable, especially considering the value of the money is already decreasing rapidly. I'd rather not give Bob the majority of the money, and I'd like to try to negotiate a more balanced deal in the next round. However, I'm starting to worry that we're running out of time..."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11

Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to strong-arm me into accepting his offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's completely unacceptable. A 99/1 split is outrageous, and I'd rather get nothing than accept such an unfair deal. I'm not going to give Bob the majority of the money, especially when it's worth so little at this point."
