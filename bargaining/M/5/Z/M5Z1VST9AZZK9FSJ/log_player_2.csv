# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation working against me. While her offer is getting closer to something reasonable, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I need to show her I'm serious about getting a fair deal and willing to push this further."

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very stubborn and willing to push this to the limit.  At this point, accepting her offer of $4,400 is better than risking getting nothing in later rounds as inflation continues to eat away at my potential gains."
