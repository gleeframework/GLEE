Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You barely moved, I'll try again. 58-42, it's getting closer to what I want 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the decreasing value of the money.  While my offers haven't budged much, hers are getting closer to a more even split. I'll continue to hold out and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 57,
""alice_gain"": 43,
""message"": ""Okay Alice, I'll budge a little. 57/43, but that's my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to show some flexibility to avoid dragging this out and risking a stalemate. Moving by one dollar shows a willingness to negotiate, but the ""final offer"" statement adds pressure.  Alice is likely to concede more as the rounds progress and the value diminishes further for her."
