"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

# Bob's message: You said it's a fair split, but I think I deserve more. This is my counteroffer. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be more cautious with my offers.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think his offer is too aggressive, and I'd like to try to negotiate further."

```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still keeping a bit more for myself to account for the inflation."

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains. With the money I gain now worth only 48.8% of what it was in the first round, I need to be very careful.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```
