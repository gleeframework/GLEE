Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a 60/40 split in my favor. This gives me a good starting point, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the best course of action. I'm losing a significant amount of value due to inflation, and Bob's offer, while not ideal, still gives me a decent amount.  It's better to accept now than risk losing even more in subsequent rounds."
