"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""}

I'm proposing that I receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000. I think this is a fair split, considering we're starting with a large amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer.  Let's get this done quickly. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth 5% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking.
