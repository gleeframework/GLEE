"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This offer gives me $600,000 and leaves Bob with $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the effects of inflation.

Since my gain is worth 5% less, I'll calculate my gain in the previous round as $600,000 * 0.95 = $570,000. So, the offer from Bob is giving me $250,000, which is less than my previous gain.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the effects of inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me $550,000 and leaves Bob with $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effects of inflation on my previous gain. Since my gain is worth 14.26% less, I'll calculate my gain in the previous round as $600,000 * 0.8547 = $513,420. This is the actual value of my gain in the previous round.

Comparing this to Bob's new offer, I'll gain $500,000, which is less than my previous gain. I'll reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

```
{
