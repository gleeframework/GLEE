"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split, giving me 900,000 and Bob 100,000. This ensures I get the majority of the money while still offering Bob a small share. Let's see what he decides!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation significantly impacts my earnings. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get at least something, and it's a better deal than risking getting nothing in the later rounds."
