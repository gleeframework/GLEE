"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'm open to negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me 60 dollars and Bob 40 dollars. I'm also sending a friendly message to Bob, indicating that I'm open to negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 50/50 is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. Since Bob's gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll aim to keep the same value in real terms.

In the first round, Bob's gain was 40 dollars, which is worth 40 dollars in real terms. To maintain the same value, I'd need to consider a 40-dollar gain in real terms in this round.

Since my gain in Bob's offer is 50 dollars, which is worth 50 dollars in real terms, I'd be getting more than I would in real terms if I accepted the 40-dollar gain.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
