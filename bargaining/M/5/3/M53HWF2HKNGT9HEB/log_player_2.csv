Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 1000$, I'll offer her a bit less, considering the 20% inflation. Here's my offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the money I gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. In the first round, $1000 was 10% of the total, so now it's worth 64% of the total. 

Alice's offer is 2000, which is 64% of the total, so in the first round it would be equivalent to $1280. I'll reject this offer since it's less than my initial gain in the first round.
