"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm not being too generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

I'm not convinced that Bob is being generous enough, especially considering the inflation is affecting me more than him. I'll hold out for a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the inflation:

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation.""

Considering Bob's offer, I'll decide to:

```
{
