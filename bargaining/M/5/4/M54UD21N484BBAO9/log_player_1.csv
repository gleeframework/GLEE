Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too greedy for the first round, Alice.  I'm proposing a more reasonable split that reflects the risk of inflation for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
