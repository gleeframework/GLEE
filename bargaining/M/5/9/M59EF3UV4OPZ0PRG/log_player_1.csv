"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script. I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering you rejected my proposal last round.  Let's see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not a chance! You're trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping he'll come back with a better proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a 5% bite, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise again. This time, I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair split.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the inflation, but I'm still holding firm on a roughly 60-40 split."
