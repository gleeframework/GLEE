"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

This is a classic game theory problem.  While Alice's offer is fair, there's a strong incentive to see what she'll offer in the next round.  There's no guarantee that she'll stay at the 60/40 split, and I can potentially get a better deal.  The threat of inflation also adds a layer of uncertainty."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script. I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering you rejected my proposal last round.  Let's see if you're willing to compromise.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise again. This time, I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair split. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Alice's offer is better than her previous one, and the risk of inflation in the next round could mean I get even less.  The 460,000 is a good amount, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal."
