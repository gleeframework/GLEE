Here's my new offer:

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to find a middle ground, Alice. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500

With the money being worth significantly less, I'll have to be even more careful. Meeting in the middle might not be the worst idea, considering the decreasing value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer from round 4.
