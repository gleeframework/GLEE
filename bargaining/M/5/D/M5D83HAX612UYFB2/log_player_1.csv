Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical, Alice. I'll take the vast majority of the money now, but I'm willing to give you a small share. If you reject this offer, I'll be forced to take everything in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","{
