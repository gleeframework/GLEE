"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Bob's offer is more generous than mine in the first round, I'll consider it a good opportunity to get a larger share of the money. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
