"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice 90% of the money, and Bob 10%.  I'm starting with a large imbalance in my favor, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further rounds and potential loss on his side due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While this offer is much better than the first round, I still believe I can do better. Bob has shown that he's willing to negotiate, so I'm not going to settle for a deal that still heavily favors him. By rejecting, I get to propose the next offer and can try to increase my share further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share while still offering a significant amount to Bob. I think this is a fair offer that balances both of our interests while taking into account the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would like to get a larger share, the inflation is hitting my gains hard.  It's clear Bob is willing to stick to his demands, and I risk losing even more if I keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer secures me a sizable amount, and further rounds would be a gamble that could significantly reduce my earnings."
