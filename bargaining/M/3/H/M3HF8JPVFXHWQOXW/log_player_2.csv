"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take a slightly larger share, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems tempting, the impact of inflation is significant.  It's highly likely I can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds as the value diminishes more rapidly for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer Alice, but the inflation is hitting you harder.  Let's settle this quickly with a more balanced split.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Taking advantage of inflation:** By Round 2, the value has diminished for both players, but more significantly for Alice (20% decrease). 
* **Balancing fairness and urgency:** While I could push for a more substantial gain in later rounds, a slightly increased offer (45/55) balances fairness with the need to reach an agreement quickly.  
* **Encouraging a quick resolution:** My message aims to remind Alice of the decreasing value and encourages her to accept a reasonable offer sooner rather than later."
