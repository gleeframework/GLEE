"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up too much 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 300,000$ is a good enough deal for me, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'd like to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better offer from you next time, Bob.""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, but still being reasonable, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve more than 35% 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk losing out on a decent amount.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'm not thrilled about it. I'll have to think carefully about my next move to try to get a better deal."
