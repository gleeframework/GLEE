"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While 100,000$ is a decent starting point, it's worth risking to see if I can get a better deal. There's a lot of money at stake, and I have 12 rounds to get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000}
``` 
I propose a 50/50 split. This is a fair and equitable offer, and it gives Alice a chance to secure a decent amount without taking any risks."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is a bit better than her initial proposal, it still seems unfair. I am willing to gamble again as inflation will hit her offer harder than mine. I will try to secure a better deal for myself in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to 600,000 for myself, hoping to incentivize Alice to accept.  It's a significant increase from my previous offer, but it's still less than half, leaving her a decent share.  I believe this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still fighting for a fair outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is now more favorable than my last proposal, taking into account the inflation impacting the value of our shares. Accepting this ensures I receive a significant sum, even with the inflation, while continuing to play risks losing everything due to the rapidly decreasing value of the remaining money."
