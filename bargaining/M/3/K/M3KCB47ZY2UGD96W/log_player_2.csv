Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offers, now it's getting worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While the offer is getting worse, it's important to remember I still have several rounds to go. Accepting a 40/60 split at this stage would be panicking. I need to show some resolve and hope Alice starts to consider the possibility of getting nothing."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 475000,
""alice_gain"": 525000,
""message"": ""Time is running out. This is my final offer, take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. While I want to maximize my gain, Alice is clearly entrenched in her strategy. This offer is a slight concession on my part, making it more appealing to her, but also setting a firm boundary. The ""final offer"" message adds pressure, as Alice needs to consider the very real possibility of walking away with nothing if this continues."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still here. You're running out of time. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but she's also revealing that she's willing to negotiate despite her earlier posturing.  My ""final offer"" bluff didn't work, but it showed her I'm serious.  The trend is bad, but I need to hold my nerve a little longer and see if she gets nervous as we get closer to the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you're a tough negotiator.  This is a serious offer, let's close this out and both walk away with something substantial.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The clock is ticking and we're entering dangerous territory. I need to make a significant move to break the stalemate. This offer matches Alice's initial proposal. It shows I'm willing to compromise and meet her halfway, but it's unlikely she'll get a better deal at this point. The message emphasizes the need for a resolution and highlights the large sum both of us stand to lose if this continues."
