"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80% and you take 20%""
}
```

I'm proposing a split where I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm really trying to get the higher amount to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate too much 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, the new amounts are:

* My gain: $5000
* Bob's gain: $5000

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll think about it for a moment...

```

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 5% less again, the new amounts are:

* My gain: $4750
* Bob's gain: $5000

I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more than 50/50""
}
```
