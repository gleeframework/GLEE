"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1} 
 
I propose taking the majority of the money, leaving Bob with a small token amount. This is a risky move, but it maximizes my potential gain. If Bob accepts, we're done. If not, I'll have to be more strategic in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm increasing Bob's share slightly, but still maintaining a large majority for myself. I'm hoping this shows good faith and will convince him to accept. If he rejects, I'll have to reassess my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100 
# Bob gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
This is a classic game of brinkmanship!  Bob is offering a slightly more generous deal than his last one, but it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I'm holding out for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

This time, I'm offering a 50/50 split.  This is a fair deal, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise. With only 7 rounds left, I need to start thinking about a resolution that ensures both of us get something."
