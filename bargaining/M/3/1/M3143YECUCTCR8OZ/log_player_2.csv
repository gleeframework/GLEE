"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 480000,
""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Your turn to be fair, I'm taking a slightly larger share this time.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer was crucial.** Waiting allows us to leverage the fact that the money loses value for Alice faster than for us.
* **The offer is designed to be tempting but firm.**  Alice loses 10% of her potential gains each round.  She might have accepted $600,000 initially, but now $520,000 might look good compared to what she'll get in round 3.
* **The message is direct but not overly aggressive.** We want to convey that we're playing strategically while leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on the last offers 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation. She's moved closer to a 50/50 split but is still trying to take a larger share. By rejecting this offer, we increase the pressure on her even further.  There's a good chance she'll make a more favorable offer in the next round, especially since the value of the money continues to decrease rapidly for her."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""This is my final offer, a fair and equal split. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time to apply the pressure:** Alice is feeling the heat of inflation. Offering a 50/50 split now seems very appealing compared to risking another round where her potential gains will shrink considerably.
* **Project firmness:**  The message ""This is my final offer"" implies that we're unwilling to negotiate further, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting.
* **Even split for a clean win:**  While we might have been able to squeeze out a slightly larger share, a 50/50 split is a good outcome considering the circumstances and guarantees a win. It avoids the risk of Alice playing for a stalemate out of spite, which would only hurt both of us due to inflation."
