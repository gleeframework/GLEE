,,,Alice,2,reject
5700.0,4300.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 55/45 is still too much in your favor. Let's meet in the middle at 57/43. This is my final offer before inflation hits again.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5200.0,4800.0,"Alice, we need to settle this quickly.  Inflation is eating away at our potential gains.  48/52 is my final offer.",Bob,4,

5500.0,4500.0,"I'm feeling the pressure from inflation, but I'm sticking to my guns. 55/45 is the best I can do. If you reject this, we both risk getting nothing.",Alice,5,
