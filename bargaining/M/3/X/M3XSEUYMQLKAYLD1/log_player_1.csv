"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm looking for a bigger cut for myself. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take a bigger cut, eh?

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd rather wait for a better deal. My response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more generous share to Bob, but still keeping a decent amount for myself."
