Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob. I'm coming down a bit more.  But this is my final offer. Let's finish this. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is trying to push through a still-advantageous deal. She's bluffing about it being her final offer. By continuing to reject her offers, Bob puts himself in a stronger position for the later rounds as the value diminishes more significantly for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Time is running out Alice, and the deal is getting worse for you with every round. This is my final offer - let's be done with this.""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  By stating this is a final offer, Bob creates a sense of urgency.
* **Strategic Concession:**  The offer is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, making it seem like a difficult concession on his part.
* **Highlighting Inflation:** Reminding Alice of the diminishing value underscores the advantage Bob holds as the rounds progress."
