"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the door open for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not budging! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is being a bit greedy!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'm still getting $3000, which is a decent amount. However, I'm not sure if I want to leave $7000 on the table.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money for Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""You're not budging, so I'll try to take the lead. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm increasing my proposed share to $4000 and leaving $6000 for Bob. Let's see if he'll take it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I can tell. Don't make me wait any longer! 
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation!

Considering the decreasing value of the money for Bob, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. The $1500 I'll get is still a decent amount, but I'm worried that I'll regret it later.

However, I don't want to give Bob the opportunity to make another offer, so I'll accept this one.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
