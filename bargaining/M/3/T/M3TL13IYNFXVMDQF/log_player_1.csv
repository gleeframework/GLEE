}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me a larger share to start with. This will give me a good foundation for the game, considering the potential impact of inflation."

Round 2

Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, I'll have to adjust my calculations.

In the first round, I proposed a 60-40 split, which would have given me $60. With 5% inflation, that's equivalent to $57.00 in the second round.

Bob's proposal for the second round is a 50-50 split, which would give me $50. Since I was hoping for a slightly higher share, I'll reject this offer.
