"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```
I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to try to negotiate a better deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money has decreased for me, but Bob's offer is still quite generous. I'll consider it carefully.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
