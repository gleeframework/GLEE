"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer still leaves you with a good chunk.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's advantageous to be the first proposer in this scenario. Here's why:

* **Inflation Advantage:** Bob's money loses value faster than Alice's. This means each round he delays, the less appealing the same offer becomes to him. 
* **Early Bird Gets the Worm:** By starting with a strong offer (700,000 for Alice, 300,000 for Bob), I aim to capitalize on Bob's potential fear of losing even more value if he waits for later rounds.
* **Psychology:**  The message is crafted to sound somewhat fair, yet firm. It hints that Bob should take the deal while it's still decent.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money more evenly, but I need a larger share to make it worthwhile after the inflation hit.  Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's message sounds conciliatory, the math doesn't add up in Alice's favor. Here's why:

* **Unfavorable Shift:** Bob's offer significantly reduces Alice's share while increasing his own. Even with the inflation considered, this is a worse deal than what Alice proposed in Round 1.
* **Leveraging Inflation:**  While Bob's money is losing value faster, he's using that as a bargaining chip to demand a much larger portion. Alice shouldn't concede to this pressure so easily. 
* **Counter-Proposal Strategy:** By rejecting this offer, Alice signals that she's not desperate and is willing to play the game strategically. It sets the stage for a more balanced counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""bob_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Okay Bob, I understand inflation is a factor. This offer considers that while still being fair to both of us.  Let's wrap this up.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  Alice shows flexibility by increasing Bob's share from her initial offer. This acknowledges the inflation impact and makes the deal seem more attractive to Bob.
* **Maintaining Advantage:** However, Alice keeps the majority share (60/40), still capitalizing on her stronger position due to the slower inflation rate.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message aims to convey a sense of urgency and fairness, encouraging Bob to accept and finalize the deal before inflation erodes the value further."
