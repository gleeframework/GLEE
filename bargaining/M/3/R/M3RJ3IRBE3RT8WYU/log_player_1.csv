Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice. However, I believe a 60/40 split in my favor is more appropriate given the potential for inflation. Let's start with this, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
I'm not going to accept an offer worse than my initial offer, especially with inflation working against Bob. He's overestimating his leverage."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about inflation, but I'm still confident that a 55/45 split in my favor is the most fair solution.  Let's avoid further delays and come to an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

Bob is clearly stuck on getting a slight advantage, even though inflation is eating into his potential gains. I need to show firmness and make it clear that I'm not budging far from a roughly even split."
