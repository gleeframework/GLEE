I'm starting with a very unfair proposal. I figure Bob might accept it out of sheer surprise or desperation, and if not, I'll have plenty of time to adjust my offer in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is an even more unfair offer than mine, and I know Bob will likely keep trying to push the same strategy. I'm not giving in, I'll make a better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  This seems like the fairest and most likely to be accepted.  We're losing value with each round, so it's time to compromise."
