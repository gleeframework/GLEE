"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, let's go for a 60/40 split in my favor.  Inflation will only make this deal less appealing in the future. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving in the right direction, the deal still heavily favors her. It's too early to accept a less-than-ideal offer, especially since the inflation disparity puts more pressure on Alice to secure a deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""The inflation is starting to hurt, Alice.  I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  Let's close this deal and both come out ahead.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly, especially for Alice. It's crucial to apply pressure and highlight the shrinking pot.
* **Strategic Counter:**  Alice offered a 60/40 split in her favor. By mirroring that offer but in my favor, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate while establishing a more advantageous position.
* **Urgency:** The message emphasizes the need for a swift resolution before inflation further erodes the value."
