"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money by 20% for me, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

This offer takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share to try to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really starting to bite!

Considering the money is now worth 48.8% less for me, I'll have to be even more cautious. However, Bob's offer is a slight improvement from his previous one, and it's getting closer to the initial 50/50 split.

I'll accept this offer.
