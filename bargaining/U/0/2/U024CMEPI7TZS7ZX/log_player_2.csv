# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Getting closer, compromise now 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate as inflation eats into her potential gains.  I can likely push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two.  My offers have been consistent, signaling that I'm not going to be swayed easily."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time to be fair.  An even split is the best option now.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to stop pushing for a larger share.  While Alice is getting the worse end of the inflation deal, I need to make sure we reach an agreement.  An even split is fair and straightforward, making it more likely Alice will accept before we both lose out."
