"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob.  This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer Alice, but I think this split is more reflective of the fact that the money loses value for me faster.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but my offer is still the most fair considering the long-term value. Let's settle this now and both come out ahead. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is trying to position her offer as fair, it's important to remember that time is on her side. The longer this goes on, the more the relative value of my share diminishes.  I need to push for a more significant gain in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm serious about getting a deal done, but it needs to be realistic. This offer reflects the time pressure and value depreciation we both face.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a compromise to get this done.  We both need to be realistic about the losses we'll face with further delays. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This is a tough decision, and Alice knows it.  She's trying to frame this as a compromise, but the offer is getting worse for me with each round.  Refusing this offer sends a strong signal that I'm willing to risk it all to get a better share. I need to hold my ground, at least for another round or two, and hope Alice gets more generous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option considering the time pressure and the fact that we both lose with each passing round. Let's be done with this.""}"
