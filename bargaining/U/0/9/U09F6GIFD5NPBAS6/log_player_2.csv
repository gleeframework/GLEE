"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'll reject this offer. While 40% is a decent starting point, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially with the inflation factor working in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to start with a 55/45 split in my favor.  Inflation is a factor, so let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us before the money becomes worthless.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out and that money is losing value fast.  I'll come down to a 55/45 split, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
With inflation working against us both, accepting this offer makes the most sense. While I'd prefer a slightly higher share, getting 45% is better than risking getting nothing at all."
