"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 6:4 split is more equitable, considering the upcoming inflation 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective values are:

* Alice's gain: 400,000 * 0.95 (95% of the original) = $380,000
* Bob's gain: 600,000 * 0.8 (80% of the original) = $480,000

I'm not thrilled about the proposed split, but I'll consider it. I'd rather not proceed to the next round if I can get a better deal. I'll accept Bob's offer.
