9000.0,1000.0,Let's start with a fair deal. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. I think it's a good starting point!,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Your turn Alice. How about we try a 70/30 split?  Remember, the value decreases every round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
8100.0,1900.0,"Okay, let's compromise a bit. I'll lower my share to 8100, leaving you with 1900.  I think it's a more reasonable split, considering the value is decreasing with each round.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"This is getting ridiculous, Alice.  Let's be realistic.  I'm offering a 60/40 split. Take it before the money shrinks even further!",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
7290.0,2710.0,"Bob, we're getting closer to the end here.  Let's not risk getting nothing at all. I'll take 7290, which is still a majority, and you can have 2710. It's a better deal than what you offered last round, and we can both walk away with something.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Alice, we need to settle this now!  I'm offering a 55/45 split.  It's more than fair considering the time pressure and the shrinking pot.  Don't be greedy!",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
6561.0,3439.0,"Bob, I'm not being greedy, I'm just trying to get the best deal for myself.  I'm offering 6561, which is still significantly more than what you're offering.  Let's end this now before it's too late for both of us.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Alice, this is getting us nowhere! We're down to the wire. Let's be practical and split this 50/50 before we both end up with nothing. It's the only fair way at this point!",Bob,8,
,,,Alice,8,accept
