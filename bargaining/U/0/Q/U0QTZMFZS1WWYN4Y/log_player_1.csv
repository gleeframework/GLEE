I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split, with me taking the larger share. I believe this is a fair offer considering the inflation factor that will negatively impact my share in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000} 
```

I'm offering a split of 810,000 for me and 190,000 for Bob.  While this is less for me than the first round, it still accounts for the inflation, and I believe it is a reasonable proposal that ensures we both gain something."
