I'm going to start with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he accepts it and we can both walk away with a sizable share of the money.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer was for him, even considering inflation. I'm going to reject this and hope I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try to strike a balance between getting a good share and making sure Bob doesn't feel completely cheated. My offer is still favorable to me, but I'm willing to give him a larger portion than in the first round."
