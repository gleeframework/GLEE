"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game.""
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial 100$, and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can finish the game quickly."
