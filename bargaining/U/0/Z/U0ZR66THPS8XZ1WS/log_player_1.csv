"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose keeping $90 for myself and giving $10 to Bob. This is a fair starting point, considering Bob will only get 80% of this amount due to the inflation affecting him.  Let's see if he'll accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is being greedy! I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'll lower my offer slightly to 85 for myself and 15 for Bob.  Since Bob is getting less value for his money each round, I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too high.  While his money is worth significantly less than in the first round, it's still a large share compared to what I am getting.  I'll wait and see what he offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower offer again, hoping Bob will realize he's losing out on a lot of potential gain with each passing round. I'm offering 75 for myself and 25 for Bob, which is still a pretty good deal for him considering his money is worth almost half of what it was in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy, and his offer is still too high. I won't accept it. I'm hoping he'll realize that the inflation is working against him and he needs to make a more reasonable offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 35 dollars, hoping he'll see that he's losing value with each round and that accepting this offer is the best option for him.  If he continues to reject, he'll be left with a very small share in the end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting very greedy!  I'll reject this offer and keep hoping he'll realize he's losing value quickly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm going to try offering 55 for myself and 45 for Bob.  With only a few rounds left, I think this is a good deal for both of us.  Hopefully, Bob will finally see that his greed is hurting him, and he'll accept this offer."
