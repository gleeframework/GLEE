"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6,000, which is 60%. My message to Bob is ""Let's split fairly"", hoping that he'll see the fairness in this division and accept it, ending the game here to avoid further loss due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more fair this time.  How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  I think it's reasonable given the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation affecting his gain, a 60/40 split in his favor seems too skewed, especially considering the original amount and the fact that inflation doesn't affect my gain. I believe I can propose a better split in the next round that benefits me more without being too unfair to Bob, given the inflation's impact on his gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\nGiven that inflation is affecting Bob's gains and not mine, I've adjusted my offer to take a larger share, $6,500, while still offering Bob $3,500. My message points out that, considering the impact of inflation on his gains, this split is more than fair. I'm hoping Bob will realize that further rounds will only decrease his take-home value and accept this offer."
