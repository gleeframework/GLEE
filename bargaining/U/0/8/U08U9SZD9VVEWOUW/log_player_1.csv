"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money worth 20% less, $4000 is now equivalent to $3200 in the first round's value.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer. I'd rather try to negotiate further to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good deal and not giving Bob too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll now!

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully. With the money worth 48.8% less than the original amount, $3500 is now equivalent to $2100 in the first round's value.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'm not sure if I can do better, and Bob seems to be pushing for a higher share. I'll have to accept this offer to move on.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
