  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle.""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""No way, Bob! I'm not accepting a 2-8 split. That's not even close to fair.""

# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""No way, Bob! 1% is not even worth my time. I'm not accepting this insult.""
