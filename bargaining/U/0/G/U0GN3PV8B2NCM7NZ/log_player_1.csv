"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I'm still trying to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept Bob's offer.
