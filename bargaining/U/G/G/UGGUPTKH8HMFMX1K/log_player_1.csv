"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This is a 4:1 ratio, which seems like a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more even this time.  I think this is a good start for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain in this round would be 80% of $40, which is $32.

Here's my response to Bob:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I deserve a bit more, considering the money is worth less than before. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain in this round would be 80% of $40, which is $32. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45:55 split, which is a more even split than my initial offer. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject my offer."
