Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with each round. Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
**Reasoning:**

Although not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking getting nothing if we fail to agree in the remaining rounds.  The longer we wait, the more value we both lose due to inflation.
