"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI made an offer where I get $55 and Bob gets $45. I also included a message saying ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"". Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, this way we both get a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer to split the money evenly. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in this round, I'd actually be getting less value than in the first round. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I need a bit more to make up for inflation""}\n\nI made an offer where I get $58 and Bob gets $42. I also included a message saying ""I need a bit more to make up for inflation"". Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each round, I'm trying to adjust my offer to account for that. Let me know how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more to reach an agreement, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll accept Bob's offer. Since the money is worth significantly less for me now due to inflation, and Bob's offer is still relatively close to an even split considering the reduced value, I think it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Let's conclude the game here.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
