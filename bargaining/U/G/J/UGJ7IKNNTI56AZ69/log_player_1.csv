Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm lowering my share slightly to 800,000, and increasing Bob's share to 200,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise given the inflation factor, and it leaves room for negotiation in future rounds."

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. With inflation so high, it's the best way to ensure both of us get something."
