"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly lopsided offer, aiming to secure a large portion of the money.  I figure Bob might be willing to accept this in the first round, as he has no guarantee of a better deal later.  However, I'm prepared for him to reject it and negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 36 
# Bob gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the money I'm receiving is significantly less than what I proposed in the first round, it's still a decent amount considering the inflation.  It's likely that if I reject this offer, the next round will leave me with even less money.  It's best to secure this offer and end the game."
