Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 560000

This is a tough one, but with the inflation rate, waiting any longer is too risky. Alice is clearly trying to push her advantage, but this offer is better than anything I'm likely to get if I keep rejecting."
