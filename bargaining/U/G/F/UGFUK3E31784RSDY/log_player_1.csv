"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable and fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, I'll try to get more this round! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since I know that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not affected by inflation in this round. However, I also know that Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.

Given that Bob is trying to get more this round, I'm not surprised by the offer. However, I'm not eager to give him a 70-30 split. I'll make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving you 70% this round, let's try again!""
}
```

It's my turn to make the next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, but still fair!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground, offering Bob a slightly higher share than last time, but still keeping a slight edge for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's gain! Given that his money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm starting to think he's getting desperate.

However, I'm not going to take advantage of him just yet. My gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and I'm not eager to give up more than I need to. I'll make another counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite there, but I'll try to meet you in the middle!""
}
```

I'll try to find a compromise that's closer to my original offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a deal, let's shake on it!""
}
```

I'm trying to meet Bob halfway, offering him a slightly higher share than my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be the one that finally sticks!"
