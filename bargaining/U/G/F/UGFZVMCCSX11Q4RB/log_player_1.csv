"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but it's still a decent share for you.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take half, it's a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer...

Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking. Bob is proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair deal, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. My response is:

{""decision"": ""reject"", ""message"": ""That's a good start, but I was thinking of getting more. Can you do better?""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 50-50 split, I'll try to get a slightly better deal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think I deserve a bit more. This is my best offer.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a slight improvement from Bob's initial offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being greedy, I'm taking a bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll on my purchasing power! With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

Bob's offer is a 60-40 split, which is a significant increase in his share. I'm not thrilled about it, but I'm also not sure if I can do better. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After some thought, I'll accept this offer. My response is:

{""decision"": ""accept"", ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the 40% share. I'm not thrilled about it, but I don't want to risk getting nothing if we don't divide the money soon.""}"
