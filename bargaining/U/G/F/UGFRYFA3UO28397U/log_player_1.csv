"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 50/50 split, which I believe is a fair and reasonable starting point. Since there's no inflation for Bob, he has no incentive to rush, but I'm hoping he'll see the value in ending the game quickly and avoiding the risk of getting nothing if we reach the 12th round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
