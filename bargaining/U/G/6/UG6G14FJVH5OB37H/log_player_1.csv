"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to set a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I'm not being generous! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, my gain of $400,000 is equivalent to $380,000 in the first round's value. That's a significant reduction.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer, considering I could potentially get a better deal in future rounds. I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit aggressive, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer myself. I'll aim to get a higher share of the money, considering the inflation factor.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You weren't very generous, so I'm taking a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, hoping to put pressure on Bob to make a better offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm trying to be more generous, but I'm not going to give you all the money! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $480,000 is equivalent to $414,240 in the first round's value. That's a significant reduction.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer, considering I could potentially get a better deal in future rounds. However, I'm also aware that the value of the money is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering the offer, I'll reject it for now.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was slightly more generous than before, I'll try to make an even more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal. I'll aim to get an even higher share of the money, considering the inflation factor.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,

# Bob's message: I'm not going to give you all the money, but I'm trying to find a middle ground! 
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll evaluate Bob's offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, my gain of $460,000 is equivalent to $356,080 in the first round's value. That's a significant reduction.
