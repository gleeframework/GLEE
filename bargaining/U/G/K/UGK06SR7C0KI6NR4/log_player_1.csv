"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer. This is a high-risk, high-reward strategy. I'm hoping Bob will be greedy and accept this offer in the first round.  If not, I'll have to adjust my strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a much better deal for me than my initial offer, even with the inflation. Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, it's best to accept and take the guaranteed money.  There's a risk that Bob might reject this offer and then make an even more unfavorable proposal in the next round."
