"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 7:3""
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 30%. I'm framing it as a fair split, but we'll see if Bob agrees!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since Bob's offer is a 50:50 split, I'll consider it. However, I think I can do better than that. I'll counter with a slightly more favorable offer for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I want 51.5:48.5""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. I'll aim to take a larger share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you 45, but I need 55""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is decreasing in value rapidly! Given the new values, I'll reassess Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll have to consider the offer carefully.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is the same as his previous offer, which I rejected. I'm not sure if he's trying to trick me into accepting a worse deal. I'll reject this offer as well.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""You offered the same deal as before, I'm not convinced""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is getting scarcer! With the values decreasing, I'll have to make a more aggressive offer to secure a decent share. I'll aim to take a larger share this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60, you can have 40, it's my last offer""
}
```"
