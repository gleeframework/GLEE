"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split in my favor, with me getting $700,000 and Bob getting $300,000. The message is a friendly one, trying to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 3:2 split, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain would be $630,000 and Bob's gain would be $900,000. I'm not too keen on this offer. 

I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Middle ground, let's meet in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55:45 split, which is a compromise between the previous offers. The message is a friendly one, suggesting that we're meeting in the middle to find a mutually acceptable solution."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain would be $363,600 and Bob's gain would be $407,200. This is a slightly better deal for me than the previous round, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.
