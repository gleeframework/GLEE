"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair, Bob.  50/50 seems like a good place to begin. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. It's the first round, and I'm not in a hurry. Maybe Alice will offer more in the next round. Plus, the money isn't losing value for me, so I'm in no rush. Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a slightly more favorable offer to myself, but still reasonable for Alice, considering the money's value decreases for her with each round.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering your loss over rounds, this seems fair.""}"
