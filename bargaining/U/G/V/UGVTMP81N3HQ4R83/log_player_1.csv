"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's a fair start, and we can adjust as needed later. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
 
While I'd prefer to keep more money, I believe accepting a 50/50 split in the second round is the best move.  It's a fair compromise, and given the risk of inflation and the possibility of getting nothing, this offer is better than the potential risk of further rounds."
