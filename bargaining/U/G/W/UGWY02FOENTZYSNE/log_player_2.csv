"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The 20% inflation rate is steep, but I think I can get a better deal than 45% of the original amount. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more since I'm making the counteroffer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's settle this, Bob. This offer is quite close to your last one, and it's better to take it before inflation eats more of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 520000 
# Alice gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the inflation, Alice's offer is reasonable, and it's close to my previous counteroffer. If I reject this offer, the value of the money will continue to decrease, and I might end up with less. I'll take the 520,000, which is approximately 63% of the original amount after adjusting for inflation."
