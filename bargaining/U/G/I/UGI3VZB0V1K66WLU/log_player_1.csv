"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Explanation:**

As Alice, I propose to keep 90% of the money, leaving 10% for Bob.  This is a fairly generous offer, aiming to incentivize Bob to accept in the first round.  Since I don't know how inflation affects Bob, I'm erring on the side of a bigger initial offer to avoid risking a longer game and potential further losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is a significant shift from the first round, it's still not advantageous for me.  Here's the breakdown:

* **My initial offer:** I offered to take 900,000, and Bob was offered 100,000.
* **Bob's counteroffer:**  He offers me 200,000, and keeps 800,000. 
* **Inflation impact:**  My offer is worth 5% less due to inflation, meaning I'd actually receive 900,000 * 0.95 = 855,000. Bob's offer is worth 20% less than his initial share, meaning he'd get 800,000 * 0.8 = 640,000.

This means I'm taking a major hit due to inflation, while Bob is still benefiting from his original offer.  It's in my best interest to reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

**Explanation:**

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm adjusting my strategy.  I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm trying to strike a balance between a reasonable offer and minimizing further inflation losses.

* **My initial offer:** I offered to take 900,000, and Bob was offered 100,000.
* **Bob's counteroffer:**  He offered me 200,000, and kept 800,000.
* **Inflation impact:**  My offer is now worth 5% less than in round 2 (855,000 * 0.95 = 812,250). 

By offering 700,000, I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money, while increasing Bob's share to incentivize him to accept. This will likely be my final offer before the inflation significantly reduces my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 360000 
# Bob gain: 640000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Explanation:**

This time, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  My potential gains have been significantly reduced by inflation. My initial offer of 900,000 is now worth 900,000 * 0.8574 = 771,660.  
* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of 360,000 is a better deal for me than the 300,000 I offered in the previous round, considering the significant inflation impact on my earnings. 

While I'd prefer to get more, the risk of further inflation and losing even more money outweighs the potential for a slightly better offer in the next round. Accepting this offer secures a decent amount of money, given the circumstances."
