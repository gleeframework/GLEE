"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority, but you'll still get a decent share.""}

I'm proposing that I take 80% of the initial 1,000,000$ and leave Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be more equitable this time. I'm taking a slightly bigger share, but you still get a substantial amount. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll need to adjust my thinking.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
