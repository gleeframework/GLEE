"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40% of the original $100, which is $40. I'll take the remaining $60."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

In this round, my gain of $40 is worth 90% of its original value, which is $36. Bob's gain of $60 is worth 80% of its original value, which is $48.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this offer is a good one for me. I'll accept it.
