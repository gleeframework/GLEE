I'm still not happy with this offer. While it's a significant increase from previous rounds, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal for myself. There's still time left in the game, and I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion of the money."

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

With only two rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is high. This offer is a 50/50 split, showing a commitment to reaching a fair agreement. This is the most reasonable offer I can make to secure a deal and avoid a complete loss."
