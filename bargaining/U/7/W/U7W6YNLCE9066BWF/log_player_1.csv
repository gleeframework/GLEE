"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30 dollars, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept it since it's a fair split and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation factor.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 40 dollars is actually worth 32 dollars (80% of 40).

I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation factor. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 80% of its original value now, I'll aim for a higher gain.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
