"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's start with a simple offer. I propose I take $60 and you take $40. This seems fair to me as a starting point. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you want a bit more, but your previous offer felt too unbalanced. How about we meet in the middle? I propose $55 for me and $45 for you.

# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll let Alice know that I've rejected her offer. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nIt's now my turn again to make an offer. Remember, the money I gain is worth 19% less than in the first round, so I need to take that into account.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 58, ""alice_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I need a bit more to make it fair.""}\n\n###\n\nLet me know how Alice responds to this offer."

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is working against you, but I'm willing to make this simple.  A 50/50 split is fair and avoids us dragging this out further. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation on my gains, a 50/50 split at this point seems reasonable to avoid further devaluation of my share. Let's conclude the game with this offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Alice know that I've accepted her offer."
