"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual amounts I'll gain are:

* Round 1: 500,000
* Round 2: 300,000 (but this is 5% less than 500,000, so it's actually 0.95 * 500,000 = 475,000)

Bob's offer is still quite lopsided, but I'll consider it. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, the money is now worth 5% less than in round 2. So, the actual amount I'll gain is 0.95 * 0.95 * 500,000 = 457,375.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob, but still keeping a slight edge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation effect:

* Round 1: 500,000
* Round 2: 0.95 * 500,000 = 475,000
* Round 3: 0.95 * 475,000 = 450,625
* Round 4: 0.85 * 450,625 = 383,531.25

Bob's offer is:

* Alice gain: 450,000
* Bob gain: 550,000

Considering the actual amounts I'll gain, Bob's offer is actually a good one for me, as it's higher than the 383,531.25 I would get if I accept it. I'll accept the offer.
