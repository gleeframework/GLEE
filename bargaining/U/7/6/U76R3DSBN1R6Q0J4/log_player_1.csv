"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60-40""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the initial round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try for a 50-50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'd actually get $4800, not $5000. And Bob's gain is worth 5% less, so he'd get $4750.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'm inclined to accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
