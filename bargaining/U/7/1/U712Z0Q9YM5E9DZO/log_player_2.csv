"Round 1

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the difference.  This is a fair offer considering the inflation, and it will save us both the hassle of more rounds. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, or I will be forced to propose something much less favorable to you in the next round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Bob.  This is a fair offer, considering the inflation. Let's end this game and split the money. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The value of Bob's potential gains is decreasing significantly with each round. Accepting a 45/55 split now is better than risking a worse offer later when the inflation will further erode his share. 
* **Downward Trend:** Alice's offers have been getting progressively better for Bob (10/90, 40/60, 45/55). Rejecting this offer might make Alice revert to a less favorable split in the next round.
* **Uncertainty:**  There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better than 45/55 in future rounds. Holding out for a slightly larger share carries the risk of ending up with a much smaller amount due to inflation."
