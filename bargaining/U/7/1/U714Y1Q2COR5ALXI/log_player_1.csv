"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I'm going to start with a very lopsided offer, as I'm unsure how the inflation will affect Bob.  If he rejects, I can always adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I'll accept the offer.  Even though it's a much fairer split than my initial proposal, I'm not sure how much further the inflation will go.  It's better to secure half the money now."
