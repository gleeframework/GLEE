Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair. We both get a good amount, and it leaves room for negotiation in the future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer.  While the split is closer, I'm still losing ground quickly due to inflation. I need to push for a more favorable deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better deal than this. Let's split 70/30 in my favor.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to move closer to your proposal, but 60/40 is the most I can offer. This way we both get a fair share, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement in the next few rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. Although Bob is showing some flexibility, the inflation is making my share shrink too quickly. I need to continue pushing for a better split."
