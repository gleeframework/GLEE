Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}

This offer gives Bob a small amount to incentivize him to accept, but leaves the majority of the money for me. Since the money is worth less for Bob in each round, it's in his best interest to accept this offer now."

Round 2

```

I'm reducing my share slightly to acknowledge the value decrease for Bob, but still aiming for a majority of the money. I believe this offer is enticing enough for him to accept, especially considering the increasing value loss he faces each round."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly higher share than my previous offer to acknowledge the significant value loss he's facing. This offer still leaves me with a majority of the money, but it's a compromise that I believe is enticing enough for Bob to accept given the diminishing value of the money for him."

```

I'm offering Bob a larger share than my previous offer to acknowledge his increasingly significant value loss. This offer still secures a significant portion of the money for me while also being generous enough to potentially entice Bob to accept. The clock is ticking, and he's running out of time to get a substantial share of the money."

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, given the dramatic value loss he is facing, it is still not favorable enough for me. This is the last round, and I will get nothing if we don't reach an agreement. But, I'm willing to risk getting nothing rather than accept an offer that is so skewed in his favor. It's been a gamble, and in the end, it didn't pay off."
