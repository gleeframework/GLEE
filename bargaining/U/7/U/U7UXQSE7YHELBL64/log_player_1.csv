"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll take the lion's share, but I'm willing to give you a decent chunk.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to be too generous just yet. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still not giving up too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $700,000 and Bob gets $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much more. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values of the offer, considering the inflation.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have $700,000 (the same as in Round 3).
Since the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, Bob's gain of $500,000 is actually worth $500,000 / (1 - 0.271) = $686,364 in the first round's value.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because it's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk going to another round with even lower values due to inflation."
