Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a very simple strategy. I'll take the majority of the money, leaving Bob with a small share. Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I'll assume he might be more willing to accept a smaller amount than I would be to accept a smaller amount in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. Even though the money I gain is worth 5% less, I believe I can still get a better deal than 40 dollars. I'm willing to wait and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to 55 dollars, still taking the majority but showing some flexibility. I believe this offer is fair considering the inflation and the fact that Bob rejected my previous offer."
