Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 3:2 split in my favor, but I'll give you the better end of the deal this time. It's a fair compromise considering the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
