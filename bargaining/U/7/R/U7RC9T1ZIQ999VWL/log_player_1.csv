"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not going to give away too much.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. But I think I deserve a bit more than half. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my $8,000 gain in the first round is now worth 80% of that, which is $6,400. Bob's $2,000 gain is now worth 95% of that, which is $1,900.

Considering Bob's new offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more than half, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
