{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm still aiming for a larger share, and Bob's offer is getting closer to a 50/50 split. I think I can do better, and I'm not ready to accept yet."

While inflation is impacting the value of the money, I still believe I deserve a larger portion. I'm offering a slightly lower share than my previous proposal, but still aiming for a significant share."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000

{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

With the significant inflation, and Bob's offer now being a 50/50 split, I think it's time to accept.  I'm not going to get a better deal at this point, and I don't want to risk getting nothing."
