"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While it's a good starting point, I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to split it 60/40, but I need more than 100,000. Let's be reasonable.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to budge a bit, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile with the inflation. Let's find a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer more, it's better to secure a deal than risk getting nothing in later rounds.  The inflation will hurt Alice more than me at this point."
