Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Given the inflation risk, I propose an equal split of $10000. This ensures fairness for both parties and mitigates potential loss due to devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
