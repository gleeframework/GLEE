"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me, I still have the same value of $600,000, but for Bob, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept it. I'm giving up $300,000, which is a significant amount, but I'm getting $700,000, which is still a substantial amount. However, I'm not sure if I should wait for a better offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal!

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you $450,000, a bit less than last time. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is now worth 27.1% less than his original offer in round 2. Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the relative value of the offer. I'm giving up $350,000, which is a smaller amount than in the previous offers, but I'm getting $650,000, which is still a significant amount.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the inflation. I might be able to get a better deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4 and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the increasing inflation. This time, I'll give Bob an even smaller share, but still a decent deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. $500,000 for both of us. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if he rejects it. Meeting in the middle might be a good compromise, considering the inflation."
