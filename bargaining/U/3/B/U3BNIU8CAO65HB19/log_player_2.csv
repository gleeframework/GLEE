Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value decreases significantly, especially for Alice. We are already past the halfway point of the rounds.
* **Diminishing Returns:** Holding out for a significantly better offer in later rounds is risky.  The potential gains from a slightly better split might be outweighed by the inflation losses.
* **Fairness:** While not ideal, a 50/50 split is fair on the surface, and Alice might be more entrenched in this position as time goes on. 

It's a gamble to reject at this stage, hoping for Alice to panic and offer a much better deal in a later round. Accepting guarantees a reasonable sum, even considering the inflation."
