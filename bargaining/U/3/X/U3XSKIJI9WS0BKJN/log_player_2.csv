Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a counteroffer. I'll give Alice a smaller share to account for the fact that I'm not sure how the inflation affects her perception of the value of money.

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting! Okay, I'll consider Alice's new offer.

Since the money is worth 9.75% less for me now, and Alice's offer is still the same, I'll think it's a good time to take it.
