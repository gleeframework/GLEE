"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 90-10 to start, and we can reassess in the next round""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%. I'm trying to get a good chunk of the money upfront, while still leaving some room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's split it evenly for now 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $500,000 I would gain is now worth 95% of the initial amount, so it's actually $475,000.

I'm not thrilled about splitting it evenly, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds with a lower value. Let's accept Bob's offer for now.
