"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll take the bigger share to invest and grow it for both of us.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80/20 split, with me taking the larger share of 8,000$. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share to ensure a stable income, and you can take the rest to invest and grow it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because the money is worth less now, and I'd rather not accept a smaller share than I would have initially. I'll wait for a new offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the loss.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a larger share now to make up for the lost value, but I'm still willing to share some with you.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me taking the larger share of 7,000$. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still willing to compromise and share the majority with you, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant inflation that has occurred, I'll have to be careful with my decision. The money is now worth 27.1% less than it was initially, which is a significant reduction.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's a fair compromise considering the current value of the money. I'll take the 5,500$ and hope that Bob's share will also be worth something substantial despite the inflation."
