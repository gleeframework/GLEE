Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily decreasing her offer, taking advantage of Bob's shrinking pot due to inflation. While the deal is getting worse, it's still better than nothing. However, rejecting this round sends a strong signal that Bob won't accept a bad deal just because time is running out. There's a chance Alice will offer something better in the next round to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option.  Do you agree?""} 

**Reasoning:** 

After rejecting several offers, it's time for Bob to show some flexibility but also stand firm on a decent deal. Offering a 50/50 split:

* **Projects fairness:** It might make Alice reconsider her approach, as she's been consistently seeking a larger share.
* **Is simple and clear:**  No need for complex justifications at this point.
* **Still beneficial to Bob:** Even with inflation, getting half is significantly better than nothing as the rounds progress. 

By Round 6, the risk of walking away with nothing is increasing rapidly. This offer balances firmness with the need to secure a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 split was a good try, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting tight! Let's analyze:

* **Time Pressure:** Only 5 rounds left, and the value for Bob diminishes rapidly each round.
* **Alice's Game:**  She's clearly playing hardball, banking on Bob caving due to the time pressure. 
* **The Offer:** $4100 is significantly less than previous rounds, but better than nothing.

**Decision:**

{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While not ideal, it's time to cut losses. Alice is unlikely to offer anything better, and the risk of getting zero is too high. Accepting now guarantees something rather than risking everything on a rapidly diminishing return."
