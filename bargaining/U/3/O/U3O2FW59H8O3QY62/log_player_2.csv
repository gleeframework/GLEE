"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more considering the faster inflation impact on my end. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next!  I'm willing to negotiate, but 4000 is a little low for me considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make this worthwhile for me. Let's split it fairly, taking into account the inflation impact on both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hitting me harder. I'm proposing a slightly better deal for you than last round, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd still prefer a larger share, I'm worried about the inflation. This is a better deal than my previous offer, and the clock is ticking."
