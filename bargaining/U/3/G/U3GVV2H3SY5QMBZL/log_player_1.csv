Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more considering the inflation risk. This way, we both get a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{
