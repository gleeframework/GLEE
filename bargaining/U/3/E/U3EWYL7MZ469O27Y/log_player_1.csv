Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll, I need to be more cautious. The 70/30 split is a bit more generous than the initial 90/10, but I'm not sure if it's enough to make it worth my while.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too skewed towards you, Bob. I'm hoping for a more even split.""

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to mirror my previous offer, but with a slight tweak. However, I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept this offer, given the inflation rate and the fact that the money is worth less than before.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns on the 60/40 split. Given the significant inflation and the fact that the money is worth less than before, I'm starting to feel a bit desperate. However, I still want to try to get a better deal.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the 60/40 split. Can we meet at 55/45?""

# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is willing to meet me at the 52/48 split, which is a significant concession from his initial 60/40 proposal. Considering the inflation and the fact that the money is worth less than before, I think this is a reasonable compromise.

I'll accept this offer and end the game. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. I accept the 52/48 split. It's a fair compromise, and I'm glad we could come to an agreement.""
