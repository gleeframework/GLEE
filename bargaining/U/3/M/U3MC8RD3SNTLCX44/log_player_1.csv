"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $200,000. I'll take the remaining 80%, which is $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can do better than that, let's try to get closer to 50-50 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about the proposal.

I'll reject this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give up 40% of the remaining value, considering the inflation. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's try 70-30""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 30% of the remaining value, which is $300,000, and I'll take the remaining 70%, which is $700,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I'm still not satisfied with the split 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

I'll think carefully about this new offer. Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll decide to accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $450,000 and Bob will take $550,000. It's a decent split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with further reduced values."
