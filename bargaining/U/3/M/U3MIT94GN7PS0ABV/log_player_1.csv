"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to keep 90 dollars for myself and give Bob 10 dollars. I'm aiming for a fair but slightly advantageous deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but I still believe I should get a larger share. I want to see if Bob will be willing to negotiate or if he's just trying to maximize his own gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I'm holding out for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm also starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  I need to find a balance between getting a good deal and risking getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I'm holding out for a fairer split. I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm not going to give in just yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm also starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I'm hoping that this offer is enticing enough for Bob to accept. If not, we're getting close to the point where the value of the money is going to be significantly less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with the offer. Bob's offer is getting worse with each round, and it's still heavily skewed in his favor. I'm holding out for a fairer split.  While the pressure of inflation is growing, I'm not willing to settle for such an unfair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split. We're both feeling the pressure of inflation now, and this is the fairest way to divide the remaining value. If Bob rejects this, we're both going to lose a lot more in the next round."
