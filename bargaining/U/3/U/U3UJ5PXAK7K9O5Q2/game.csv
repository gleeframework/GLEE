4000.0,6000.0,"I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me getting the larger share since the money will be worth less to you in the next round. Let's end this quickly.",Bob,2,

5500.0,4500.0,"Bob, your offer was tempting, but not fair in the long run. Let's be reasonable: I'll take a slightly smaller share than last time, 55/45. This reflects the changing value and avoids further losses for both of us.",Alice,3,
