"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 3:2 ratio in favor of fairness, considering the initial equal distribution of funds. This compromise allows us to balance our interests while accounting for the impact of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
