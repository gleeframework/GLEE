"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives me a large share (90%) and leaves Bob with a smaller share (10%). It's a high-risk, high-reward strategy.  I'm hoping Bob will accept it, but if he doesn't, I'll need to adjust my strategy in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much less favorable than my initial proposal.  While the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm still confident I can secure a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000, which is slightly more than his previous offer, but still significantly less than my initial proposal. I'm hoping this compromise will be enough to convince him to accept.  If he rejects, I'll need to get more aggressive with my offers in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly less than what I believe I can get.  I will reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round. I need to be more aggressive in my offers to make sure I get a fair share of the money before the inflation eats away at my earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer for Bob to 400,000. It's still a better deal for me, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid further rounds and the potential for more inflation.  I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still less than I would like to accept.  I'm going to continue to reject offers in the hopes of being able to negotiate a better deal for myself in the next round. Although inflation is cutting into my potential gains, I'm not willing to settle for a deal that I believe is unfair."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000, which is closer to his last offer. I need to find a compromise point, but I'm still trying to get as much as I can.  I'm hopeful he will accept this offer before the inflation impacts us both even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is significantly impacting my potential gains.  I will reject this offer and continue to negotiate in the hopes of getting a better deal. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds, but I'm determined to get a fair share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

With only a few rounds left, the inflation is getting increasingly serious. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances, and I hope Bob will finally see reason and accept it. If he doesn't, we're both going to lose a lot more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and the inflation is seriously hurting my potential gains. I cannot accept this offer and I will continue to negotiate in the hopes of getting a better deal.  I need to get a more equitable share of the money before the remaining rounds pass.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint, but I'm still determined to secure a fair outcome for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

With only two rounds left, I need to be flexible. I'm proposing a 45/55 split in my favor. This is a compromise, acknowledging the inflation and Bob's recent offers, but still gives me a significant portion.  I'm hoping this will finally convince Bob to accept, as the next round will be even more detrimental due to inflation."
