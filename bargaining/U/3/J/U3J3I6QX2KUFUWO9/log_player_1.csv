# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than before, so I need to consider that in my decision.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving him a 60/40 split, especially since I'm the one taking the risk of negotiating with him.
