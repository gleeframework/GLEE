Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 65/35, giving me a bit more to compensate for the faster inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65
