"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you'll get a decent chunk. Accept and we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise a bit more. But you need to be more reasonable.  This is my final offer. Accept, or we both risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is offering more, the penalty for waiting is starting to become significant. It's time to apply more pressure and hope Alice doesn't want to risk losing everything."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Accept this offer, or I'm playing hardball from here on out.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing money with every round. This is my last chance to be generous.  Take this or risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting nervous, which is good. She's trying to disguise a worse offer as ""generosity"".  However, time is running out, and I need to show I'm serious. The next offer will be my last chance to push for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it.  We are both running out of time. Meet me in the middle or walk away with nothing.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is it, Bob. We're both getting desperate. Let's compromise before we lose everything. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Time has run out for clever negotiation.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer secures me a reasonable sum that's significantly better than nothing.  Rejecting at this point is too risky, as Alice seems firm, and the penalty for waiting further is too high."
