"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair and simple proposal, hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to take a bigger share, huh? Considering the inflation effect, I'll think carefully...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less, I should be cautious. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next move!

Considering Bob's previous offer, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer to see if he's willing to compromise. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim for a larger share.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You wanted more, now it's your turn to compromise!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I think it's getting too close to 50/50 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll, and Bob's gain is worth less and less!

Considering the decreasing value of Bob's gain, I'll think carefully about this offer. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I should be cautious about giving up too much.

However, Bob's message suggests he's willing to compromise, and 45 is closer to 50 than 60. I'll accept this offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
