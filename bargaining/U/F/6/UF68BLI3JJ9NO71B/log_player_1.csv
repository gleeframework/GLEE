"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both get a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred more, accepting this offer ensures I get something. The inflation would make any further negotiation risky, and Bob might become more demanding."
