Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have accepted my previous offers, now I'm being less generous. 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough spot.  While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice at this point:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round for me (Bob). Waiting longer means getting even less.
* **Alice's Declining Offers:** Alice is becoming less generous, and there's no guarantee her offers will improve. 

It's a gamble either way, but accepting now cuts my losses and avoids the risk of an even worse offer later."
