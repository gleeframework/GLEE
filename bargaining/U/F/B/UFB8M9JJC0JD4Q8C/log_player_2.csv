Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle. This time I'll take less, but I'm still taking the lead. We can finish this game now.

# Alice gain: 8000

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving in completely. This is my final offer before we both start losing too much. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure from inflation and is trying to get me to settle. However, this is the same offer she gave me in Round 2. Since time is on my side (her share is decreasing, mine is not), I will continue to hold out for a better deal."

Round 6

{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Alice, inflation is working against you. I'm offering you a deal where you still get a good chunk of the money. Don't let this opportunity slip away!""}

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still fighting for a fair share. This is my last chance to negotiate before we both lose out. Let's end this now. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 7 is now the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and with each round, Alice's share diminishes significantly. This puts increasing pressure on her to make a deal.
* **Improved Offer:** This offer is better than her previous ones, with Bob receiving $4000 instead of the earlier $3000.
* **Risk of Loss:** If I reject this offer, there's no guarantee that Alice will offer anything better in subsequent rounds. We risk reaching a point where her offers become unreasonable out of desperation, and we both lose.

It's a tough call, but taking the sure $4000 now outweighs the risk of getting a potentially worse deal (or nothing) later."
