"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55-45 split in my favor. While I acknowledge the decreasing value of the money, this split reflects a fairer distribution considering the risk you take by rejecting my offer.   
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
