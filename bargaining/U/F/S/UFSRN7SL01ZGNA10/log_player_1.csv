I'm starting with a very aggressive proposal, leaving Bob with a very small share. I hope to end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's a significant gain, I still believe I can get a larger share.  Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}

I'm offering a more balanced split this time. I believe this is a fair offer that Bob is likely to accept."
