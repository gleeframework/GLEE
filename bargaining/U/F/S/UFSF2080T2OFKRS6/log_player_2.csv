"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money while it's still worth a lot. This offer gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Bob should reject this offer. Even though it seems like a fair deal at first, the inflation rate is going to drastically reduce the value of the money in future rounds. Bob can likely get a better deal by waiting and making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. With inflation, the money will be worth less in the next round. Let's split it this way, and we both get a larger share now.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. It's crucial we settle now before inflation eats away at the value. This offer ensures we both benefit. Let's be reasonable and end this here. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

Bob should accept this offer.  While it's not as favorable as his initial counter-offer, the inflation rate is working against him, and Alice's offer is still better than the initial split.  The risk of waiting for another round and possibly getting a worse deal is not worth it."
