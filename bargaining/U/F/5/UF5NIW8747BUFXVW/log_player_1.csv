"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, giving Bob a 40% share of the initial $10,000. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision. Since Bob's offer is 50-50, I'll have to think carefully about whether I can do better in the next round.

For now, I'll reject Bob's offer and try to do better.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to round 2. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm trying to take a slightly more aggressive stance, but still keeping a reasonable balance between our shares."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings! With the money being worth 27.1% less for me and 14.26% less for Bob, Bob's offer seems to be a good one. I'll accept it to avoid further losses.
