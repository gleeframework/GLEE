I propose a 50/50 split.  It's fair and avoids any immediate conflict."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm willing to give a little ground, but I'm not going to give in entirely to Bob's demands. A 45/55 split is more fair than his offer, given that the value of my share is decreasing with each round."
