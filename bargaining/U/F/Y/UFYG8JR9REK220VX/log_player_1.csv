"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 999000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

This means I'm offering to give Bob a small token amount of $1,000, while I take the rest, $999,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is mirroring my offer from Round 1! I'll accept his offer, since it's a fair trade.
