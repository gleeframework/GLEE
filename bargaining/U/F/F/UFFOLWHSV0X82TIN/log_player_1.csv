"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by proposing a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. Given the impact of inflation, it's essential to find a mutually agreeable split early on to maximize the value for both of us. The message ""Let's be fair"" aims to convey a sense of fairness and encourage Bob to accept this offer, considering the increasing devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, his proposed split seems too skewed in his favor, especially considering the higher rate at which the value of his share is decreasing. The message ""I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation!"" doesn't align with the numbers, as the devaluation hits Bob's share harder. I believe there's room for a more balanced division, taking into account the differing impacts of inflation on our shares. It's strategic to proceed to the next round, aiming for a better offer or the chance to propose a more equitable split myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is more than fair""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm proposing a division of $5,500 for myself and $4,500 for Bob. Given that the value of the money decreases with each round, I've adjusted my offer to still aim for a relatively fair split while also considering the strategic aspect of the game. The message ""Considering the inflation, this is more than fair"" is intended to highlight the fact that the devaluation affects Bob's share more significantly, making this offer more generous than it appears at first glance. I'm hoping this adjusted offer will be more appealing to Bob and conclude the game in this round."
