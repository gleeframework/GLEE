"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, meet me halfway! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer is getting closer to something more reasonable, it's still heavily skewed in Alice's favor, especially considering the accelerating inflation working against me. It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a fair deal considering the inflation we're both facing.""}"

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly playing on the inflation factor, and her offer is getting worse! I need to hold firm, but it's getting risky. I'll need to make a more appealing offer soon to avoid walking away with nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the only fair option now. Take it or leave it.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**  This is a tough one, but with the inflation rate escalating, I'm running out of time.  Alice is being ruthless, but taking the $4,200 is better than nothing, which is what I'll be left with in a few more rounds."
