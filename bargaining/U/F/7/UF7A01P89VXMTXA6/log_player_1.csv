"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject my proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going for 50/50 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, my gain of 4000 is now worth 4000 * 0.9 = 3600.

I'll think about Bob's offer... Hmm, it's still a bit biased towards Bob, but it's a slightly better deal than the 50/50 split. I'll decide to reject this offer and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the 10% inflation again, my gain of 3600 from Round 2 is now worth 3600 * 0.9 = 3240.

Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think this is a fair deal""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going for less than 7,000 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 27.1% inflation, my gain of 4200 from Round 3 is now worth 4200 * 0.727 = 3042.6.

I'll consider Bob's new offer... Hmm, it's still a bit biased towards Bob, but he's taking a slightly smaller share. I'm not sure if I want to give him 7000, but I'm not sure if I want to reject this offer either.

After some thought, I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
