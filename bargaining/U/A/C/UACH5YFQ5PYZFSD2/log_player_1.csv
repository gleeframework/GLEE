"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's more fair to split it 60-40, with me taking the larger share this time.  Let's see if you agree. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob wants to flip the script and take the larger share this time.

Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 400,000 * 0.8 = 320,000
* Bob gain: 600,000 * 0.8 = 480,000

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a larger share, but I don't want to prolong the game. I'll accept this offer.
