"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the money quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a straightforward and easy way for both of us to get something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, a fair and reasonable proposal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so I need to be careful.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. My current offer was rejected, and now Bob is offering a 50/50 split, which is a bit more generous than my initial offer, but still not ideal for me.

Round 3

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Take this offer and we can avoid a long and complicated negotiation!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but it's still a decent deal considering the inflation."

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 51.2% of what it was in the first round, which is getting smaller and smaller. I need to be careful not to get too little.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer is still not ideal for me, and I think I can do better.

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 32.77% of its original value, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still not ideal, but I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.

I'll accept this offer, even though it's not my preferred outcome.
