"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, my gain of $200,000 in Round 2 is equivalent to $160,000 in Round 1. 

I'm not willing to accept an offer that's worse than the one I made in Round 1. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since the money is worth 40% less than the initial amount due to inflation (20% in Round 1 and another 20% in Round 2), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 320000,
  ""bob_gain"": 680000
}
```

This way, I'll get 32% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 68%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less than the initial amount due to inflation (20% in Round 1, 20% in Round 2, and 8.8% in Round 3), I'll calculate my gain in equivalent Round 1 dollars.

My gain of $400,000 in Round 4 is equivalent to approximately $672,000 in Round 1.

I'm not willing to accept an offer that's worse than the one I made in Round 1. I'll reject this offer.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 256000,
  ""bob_gain"": 744000
}
```

This way, I'll get 25.6% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 74.4%."
