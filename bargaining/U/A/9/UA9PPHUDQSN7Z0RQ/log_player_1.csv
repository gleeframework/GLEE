I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly. I figure a single dollar is better than nothing!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 500000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

A 50/50 split is fair, and I'd rather not risk getting nothing by continuing the game."
