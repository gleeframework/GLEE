Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fair. Let's try 55 for me and 45 for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55

Round 3

""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, your offer in the last round would be more appealing if the value of our shares didn't decrease over time. How about we try my previous offer, but with the numbers reversed? I get $55, and you get $45.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more to close this out. Let's go with 60 for me and 40 for you.  It's a better deal than the last round, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting desperate and undervaluing the impact of inflation. While he's offering slightly more than last round, it's still a worse deal for me than my original offer. I'm willing to hold out and see if I can get closer to my initial split."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 57,
""bob_gain"": 43,
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find a middle ground. I understand the inflation is a factor for you, so I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly. How about $57 for me and $43 for you? It's a compromise that considers the time pressure."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm adjusting my offer slightly downwards to show a willingness to compromise, but I'm still aiming for a better deal than Bob's last offer. The message emphasizes finding a middle ground and acknowledges the time pressure (and thus the impact of inflation). This approach aims to secure a deal this round without conceding too much."
