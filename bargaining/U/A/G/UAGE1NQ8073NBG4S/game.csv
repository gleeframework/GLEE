55.0,45.0,"Bob, your offer in the last round would be more appealing if the value of our shares didn't decrease over time. How about we try my previous offer, but with the numbers reversed? I get $55, and you get $45.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
40.0,60.0,"I'm willing to give you a bit more to close this out. Let's go with 60 for me and 40 for you.  It's a better deal than the last round, considering the inflation.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
57.0,43.0,"Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find a middle ground. I understand the inflation is a factor for you, so I'm willing to adjust my offer slightly. How about $57 for me and $43 for you? It's a compromise that considers the time pressure.",Alice,5,
