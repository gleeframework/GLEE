I'm going for a slightly unfair split in my favor, but I think Bob will likely accept it to avoid getting nothing in later rounds.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a fair offer and I'd rather get $50 now than risk getting nothing later."
