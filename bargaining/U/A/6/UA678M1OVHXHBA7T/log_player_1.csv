"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you $4,000, and I'll take the rest.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a split that's fairer for both of us. This offer reflects a compromise, and I believe it's more reasonable considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me now, I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It seems like Bob's compromise is a good one, and I'm willing to accept his offer."
