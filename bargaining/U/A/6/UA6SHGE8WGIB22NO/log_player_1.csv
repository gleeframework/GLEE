Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're losing valuable time and money with these back-and-forth offers.  I'm proposing a 52/48 split, a slight adjustment from my previous offer, to show I'm willing to compromise for a quick resolution. Let's settle this now.

# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his advantageous split, even though it's clear I'm not going to accept a deal that heavily favors him.  Time is a factor, but it's working against him more than me.  He'll need to make a much better offer if he wants to settle this before round 6 or 7."
