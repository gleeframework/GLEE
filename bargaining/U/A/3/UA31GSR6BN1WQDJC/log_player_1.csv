"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering the inflation we both face.  It's more advantageous for me in the long run, but still leaves you with a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
