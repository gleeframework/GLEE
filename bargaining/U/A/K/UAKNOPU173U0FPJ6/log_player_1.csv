"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent amount, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 200,000 is actually worth 95% of 200,000, which is 190,000.

I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it. I'd like to negotiate a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is a bit too one-sided. I'll make a counteroffer: 420,000 for me and 580,000 for you.""

```"

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,

I'm hoping Bob will accept this time!"
