"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a fair start, considering I'm taking the risk of going first. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
 
While a 10% share isn't terrible, it's worth seeing if Alice will budge in the next round, especially since inflation will lower the value of the money if we continue."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fairer split considering the risk of you rejecting my offer and having to wait another round for your turn."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm going to counter your offer with a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise considering we both had to wait a round, and I'm still taking the risk of you rejecting my offer again. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, the inflation is starting to bite. It's not worth risking another round for a few hundred dollars more, especially considering Alice's offer is closer to the 55/45 split I initially proposed."
