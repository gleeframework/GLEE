"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a generous and reasonable starting point for our negotiation. The message ""Let's split fairly"" conveys my intention to find a mutually acceptable division of the money. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept my offer or proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more balanced split, considering we both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a better deal. The 55-45 split in Bob's favor is not favorable to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try to get a more advantageous division of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm offering a 57-43 split in my favor, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" indicates my willingness to find a mutually acceptable middle ground. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept my offer or proceed to the next round."
