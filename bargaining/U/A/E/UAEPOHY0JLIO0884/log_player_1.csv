I'm taking almost everything, knowing the money is worth less to me in the next round.  Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob is being generous, but I can still do better! I know the money will be worth less to me in the next round, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm aiming for a middle ground here.  I'm still taking the majority, but I'm being more reasonable than my first offer. Hopefully, Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 666667 
# Bob gain: 333333 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'm accepting this offer. The inflation is hitting hard, and while I'd like more, it's better than getting nothing at all.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a worse deal later."
