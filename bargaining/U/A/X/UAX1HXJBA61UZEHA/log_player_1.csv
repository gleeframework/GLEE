Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hitting you harder, but I'm still willing to share. Meet me in the middle, considering our losses. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is right that inflation is hitting me harder, but his offer doesn't reflect that enough. I need to push for a larger share while I still have some leverage."
