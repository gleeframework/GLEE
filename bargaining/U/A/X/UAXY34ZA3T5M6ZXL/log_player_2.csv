Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, let's compromise. I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get at least 5500 to make this worth it for me.  We're both losing money with every round, so let's be practical. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is still getting the better end of the deal even with the inflation. I need to hold out for a better offer."
