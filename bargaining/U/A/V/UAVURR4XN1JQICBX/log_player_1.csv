Let's see if Bob is happy with a 90/10 split!  I'm aiming for a good chunk of the money, but I'm also keeping in mind that inflation will eat into the value in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd love to have more, accepting this 50/50 split is the best option. Inflation is already eating away at the value of the money, and there's no guarantee I'll be able to get a better deal in the next round."
