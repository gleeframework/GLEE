"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but this is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Alice's share loses value faster than Bob's due to the higher inflation rate she experiences. This puts pressure on Alice to reach an agreement quickly. 
* **Slight Advantage:** Bob's offer is still generous to Alice, but it claims a slightly larger share for himself compared to Alice's initial proposal. 
* **Finality:** By stating this is his final offer, Bob creates a sense of urgency and implies he's willing to risk further inflation to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter-offer, slightly better for me 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Advantage:** Time is on Bob's side. Alice's share is devaluing significantly faster than his. Each round that she rejects an offer puts more pressure on her to accept a less favorable deal later.
* **Marginal Improvement:** Alice's counter-offer is only marginally better for her and still worse for Bob than his previous offer. This suggests Bob has room to negotiate further. 
* **Holding Firm:** By continuing to reject offers that don't meet his needs, Bob signals that he's serious about getting a better share and is willing to wait for a more advantageous proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 470000,
""alice_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is a good deal for both of us considering the circumstances. Let's end this here.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Bob increases his previous offer slightly, showing a willingness to negotiate while still securing a better split than Alice's initial offer.
* **Highlighting Time Pressure:** The message emphasizes that the deal benefits both parties *considering the circumstances* - a subtle reminder of the inflation working against Alice. 
* **Urgency & Finality:** While not explicitly a ""final offer,"" the tone suggests strong urgency to settle. Bob wants to avoid further rounds where the value diminishes for both, but especially for Alice."
