"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a straightforward and generous offer. If Bob accepts, I'll get 90% of the money, and he'll get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. This way, we both get a good amount and avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's proposal is a fair one, but I'm not sure if I want to give him 50% of the money. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I'd rather keep a larger share. However, the risk of inflation is real, and splitting it evenly might be a good way to mitigate that risk.

I'll reject this offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not ready to give up 50% yet. Let's see if we can do better.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll offer him a smaller share this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""This is my best offer so far. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 40/60,  I'll take the smaller share to avoid further inflation risks. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth significantly less for Bob now, so he's willing to take a smaller share to avoid further losses. I'm not sure if I want to give him 40% of the money, but it's a decent compromise.

I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, 60/40 it is. Let's call it a day!""
}
```"
