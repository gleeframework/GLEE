Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 80

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm trying to be fair, but you need to meet me halfway. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

Bob's offer is getting uncomfortably close to the point where it would be more beneficial for me to accept his previous offer due to inflation eating into his potential gains. It's unlikely he'll offer anything significantly better than this, and waiting any longer is too risky."
