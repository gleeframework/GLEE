"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which is a relatively even division of the $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this one! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of me!

I reject Bob's offer. His proposal is too skewed in his favor, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between my initial offer and Bob's offer, hoping to get a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still want more! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to get the better deal!

I reject Bob's offer again. His proposal is still too close to the previous offer, and I'm not willing to give him the majority of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, but I'm willing to give you a bit more.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a sweet spot that's closer to the middle, but still gives me a slight edge."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I'm not there yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to push for a bigger share!

I reject Bob's offer again. His proposal is getting closer to the 60-40 split he initially rejected, and I'm not willing to give him the majority of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no more negotiations!""
}
```

I'm trying to force a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable compromise."
