Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'll take 999,999 and leave Bob with just 1 dollar.  Since I get to propose first, I'm going to maximize my share.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

It's better to take 500,000 now than to risk getting nothing in the next round, especially since Bob's offer is worth less to him due to inflation."
