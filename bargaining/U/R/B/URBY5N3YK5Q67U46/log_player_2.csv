"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with this. It's a reasonable offer to get the game going. Think about the declining value! 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI think I can get a better deal than that! The 20% inflation rate is a concern, but I'm willing to take the risk to potentially get a larger share. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a more reasonable offer. Let's split it fairly!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the value is decreasing rapidly, especially for you. This is my final offer before the impact is even greater. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take it. The rapidly decreasing value due to inflation is a significant concern, and I don't want to risk losing even more value in the next round. This offer is better than the initial one, so I'll accept it. {""decision"": ""accept""}"
