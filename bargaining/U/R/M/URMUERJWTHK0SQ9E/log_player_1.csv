"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 
I'll take 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%. I want to establish a strong starting position and see if he'll accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial proposal. While the money is worth less due to inflation, I am not desperate to accept a deal that cuts my share so dramatically. I will continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
``` 

I'll reduce my share slightly to 70%, offering Bob 30%.  This still gives me a good share, but it shows flexibility and might entice Bob to accept a deal before the value of the money diminishes further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still very unfavorable. Even though the money has lost a lot of value, I am not ready to accept a 50/50 split, especially since I was initially asking for 90%. I'll try to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'll offer Bob 40% and keep 60% for myself. The value of the money is declining rapidly, so I need to secure a good deal. But I'm also willing to compromise slightly, offering Bob a larger share than in my previous proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse and worse. While the value of the money is declining, I'm still not willing to accept such a small share. I'm hopeful that I can secure a more equitable split in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to secure a deal.  I'll offer a 50/50 split. This is a significant concession from my earlier proposals, but it's the most I'm willing to give at this point. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer before the money becomes essentially worthless."
