Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. This is your last chance to get a decent share before inflation eats away at my gains. My offer stands.

# Alice gain: 60

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sticking to my offer. This is becoming ridiculous. Do you understand how inflation works? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly stuck on her initial offer and doesn't seem to grasp how quickly inflation is diminishing her returns. While the deal is still okay for me, accepting now sets a bad precedent. I'm betting she'll become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the impact of inflation on her share becomes even more severe."
