Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, and I'm not getting any younger. I'm taking what I can get, and you're getting scraps. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
At this point, accepting is the only rational choice. Even though the deal is incredibly unfavorable, any further rounds will lead to a drastically reduced gain for Alice and a potential loss if they run out of time. It's better to take the small amount than risk losing everything."
