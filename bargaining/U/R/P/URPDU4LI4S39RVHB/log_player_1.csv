"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, let's move on! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, my $3,000 is worth 95% of the original $6,000 I proposed in the first round, which is a significant reduction.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I'll take a chance. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
