"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm starting with a fair offer, hoping Bob will accept it and we can finish the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be careful with Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'd be getting $40, which is still a decent amount. However, I'm not sure if I should accept it, as I could potentially get more in future rounds.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 20% less for Bob (10% less from the first round and another 10% from the second round), I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money for Bob.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not getting any younger. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 45, but I think I'm getting the better end of the deal. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the decreasing value of the money for me. However, I'll have to consider the fact that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, so $45 is a decent amount.

Since the money Bob gains is worth significantly less than in the first round, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. I'll have to weigh the risks and benefits.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With each passing round, the money Bob gains is worth less and less, so I'll try to take advantage of that. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to be more aggressive.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're getting less and less, Bob. Time to make a serious offer!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I still think I deserve more. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more and more desperate, and the value of the money he gains is decreasing rapidly. With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, $70 is a significant amount.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as I might be able to get more in future rounds. On the other hand, if I reject it, the value of the money for Bob will continue to decrease, and I might end up with less.

I'll reject Bob's offer for now and try to negotiate further.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money Bob gains being worth significantly less than in the first round, I'll try to take advantage of his desperation. Since I'm not affected by inflation, I can afford to be even more aggressive.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. This is my best offer. Take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm almost out of options, but I'm not giving up yet. This is my final offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting really desperate now, and the value of the money he gains is decreasing rapidly. With the money I gain still being worth the same as in the first round, $90 is an extremely attractive offer.

Considering the limited number of rounds left, I think it's time to take a risk and accept Bob's offer. I'll get a significant amount of money, and it's likely that the value of the remaining money will continue to decrease.
