Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to offer Bob $100,000 and keep $900,000 for myself. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob $550,000 and keep $450,000 for myself.  Since we're both aware of inflation, I think this is a fair offer that reflects the decreasing value of the money over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer more, I've already lost a significant portion of my potential gains due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than I initially hoped for."
