"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer is generous considering the shrinking pot. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives me 35% of the initial amount, but I think I can get a better deal considering the inflation rate affects me more. Let's see what happens in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the inflation and tries to find a middle ground. Given that the money is worth less with each passing round, especially for me, I'll aim for a slightly higher share.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 420000, ""alice_gain"": 580000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a fairer split.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. I'm being flexible, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Given the increasing impact of inflation, especially on my share, accepting 38% of the initial amount now is less valuable than it would have been in the first round. Since Alice claims this is her final offer but the game allows for more rounds, I'll push for a better deal, considering we have 9 more rounds left.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nGiven the increasing pressure of inflation and Alice's claim that her last offer was final, I'll try to make a more compelling offer that still leans in my favor but acknowledges the urgency and the devaluing money. Since Alice's share devalues less, she might be more inclined to wait, but the risk of losing everything if we don't agree by round 12 should motivate her to consider a reasonable offer.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""Let's compromise given the urgency and inflation impact.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is it, Bob. Take it or leave it. The clock is running out! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer. Although the pressure is mounting and the value of the money is significantly decreasing, especially for me, accepting 40% of the initial amount now is worth substantially less due to the high inflation rate affecting my share. Alice's share is also devaluing, but at a slower rate. Given we still have 7 rounds left, I'll gamble on the possibility of Alice wanting to secure a deal before the value drops further or we hit the deadline, risking both of us getting nothing.\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","At this point, the pressure of inflation is significantly impacting my potential gain, and each round decreases its value dramatically more than Alice's. However, Alice also faces a substantial loss if we fail to agree by round 12. Considering this, I'll attempt to make an offer that is closer to Alice's last proposal but still tries to maximize my share, given the critical stage of negotiations we're in.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 480000, ""alice_gain"": 520000, ""message"": ""Given the critical stage, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my absolute final offer, Bob.  We both lose if you reject this. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the extreme devaluation of the money at this stage, especially for my share which has lost nearly 74% of its value compared to the first round, and Alice's share losing almost 47%, the risk of continuing negotiations outweighs the potential benefits. The difference in any further offers would be negligible in real value, and the risk of both of us walking away with nothing is too high. Accepting this offer, despite it not being ideal, is the most pragmatic decision to ensure I receive some compensation, even if it's far from the initial value.\n\n###\n\nLet's conclude the game here."
