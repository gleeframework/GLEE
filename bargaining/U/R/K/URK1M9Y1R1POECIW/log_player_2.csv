"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, I'll get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but this is my final offer.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Alice's offer:** Alice's offer was heavily skewed in her favor.  It makes sense to reject it and see if I can negotiate a better deal.
* **My offer:** I'm proposing a split that gives me a slight advantage while still being somewhat appealing to Alice.  
    * It's important to remember that the value of the money is decreasing for both of us. Delaying further significantly hurts me (10% per round) more than it hurts Alice (5% per round). 
    * My offer is a good balance between getting a larger share and making sure Alice doesn't see more value in waiting for another round.
* **Message:** By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to add a sense of urgency and discourage Alice from pushing for another round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Counter offer, don't be too greedy 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to a more even split, but it's still in her favor. However, continued inflation is hurting me more than her. 

* **My losses:**  The 19% decrease in value for me means this offer is worth significantly less than it appears. 
* **Alice's losses:** Alice is also losing value, though at a slower rate (9.75%).  She's likely feeling the pressure to make a deal.

While I could push for a slightly better deal in the next round, the potential gains are outweighed by the risk of further inflation. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable, albeit not ideal, payout."
