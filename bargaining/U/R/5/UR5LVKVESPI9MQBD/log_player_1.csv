"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI offered Bob $400,000 and kept $600,000 for myself, hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it. I included the message ""Let's be fair"" to convey that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation we'll both be facing. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI decided to reject Bob's offer because, considering the inflation, the $400,000 I would gain is actually worth less than its face value. In real terms, it's more like gaining $320,000 ($400,000 * 0.8). I think I can make a better offer in the next round, so I'll reject this proposal and proceed. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI decided to offer a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will see this as a fair compromise. Considering the inflation, the $500,000 I would gain is actually worth $400,000 ($500,000 * 0.8), but I'm willing to accept this to reach an agreement. I included the message ""Meet me in the middle"" to convey that I'm willing to find a mutually acceptable solution. Let's see how Bob responds!"
