Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, it's now worth 80% of its original value. I'll aim to get as much as possible while leaving Alice with a decent amount.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 36% less, and the money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round, I need to be cautious. However, 20$ is still a decent amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.
