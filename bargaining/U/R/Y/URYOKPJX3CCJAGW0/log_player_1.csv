"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55-45 is a fairer split, considering the inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that 55-45 is the best split, considering the initial offer I made was 60-40. I think I can do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rate, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'll compromise and offer 58-42, considering the decreasing value of the money""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground that still gives me a slightly better share, but not too aggressive, considering the inflation rate."
