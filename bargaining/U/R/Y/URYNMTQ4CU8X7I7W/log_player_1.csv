"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob $100,000, and I'll take the remaining $900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think carefully about this offer... and decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'd like to try to get a better deal, considering the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation still affecting my potential gain, I'll aim to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000, and I'll take the remaining $700,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering the reduced value of my potential gain, I'll think carefully about this offer... and decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it seems like a decent compromise given the current economic conditions."
