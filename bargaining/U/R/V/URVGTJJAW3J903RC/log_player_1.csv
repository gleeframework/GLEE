"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a small amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle and take a fair share 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the new values, my gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of the original $8,000, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of the original $5,250.

I'll think about it...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the increased inflation.

Since my gain is worth 64% of the original amount (80% of 80%), I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit stingy, let's give me a bit more to make up for the inflation.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but not too much, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my gains!

Considering the new values, my gain of $4,000 is worth 40% of the original $10,000, and Bob's gain of $6,000 is worth 60% of the original $10,000.

I'll think about it...
