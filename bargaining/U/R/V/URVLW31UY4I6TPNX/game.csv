60.0,40.0,"Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take $60, you take $40.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"I think it's fairer if I get $60, since I'm taking the risk of rejecting your offer.  Let's split it down the middle this time.",Bob,2,
,,"That's a bold strategy considering the inflation working against you, Bob. Let's see how the next round goes.",Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"Okay Bob, let's try this again. I'll take a little less this time with $55, leaving you with $45.  Remember, inflation is hurting both of us, but especially you in the long run.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
45.0,55.0,I'm willing to compromise.  Let's split it 55/45 this time.  We need to reach an agreement before inflation eats away too much of our potential gains!,Bob,4,
,,"You drive a hard bargain, Bob, but you just offered me the same deal *I* offered *you* last round!  Don't underestimate my patience. The longer we wait, the worse it is for you.",Alice,4,reject
52.0,48.0,"Alright Bob, I'm willing to be a little more generous. I'll take $52, and you get $48.  Let's be realistic, the clock is ticking, and we're both losing money.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
48.0,52.0,"I appreciate your generosity, but I think we can still split it more evenly. Let's go with 52/48 this time.  We're getting close to the end, so let's make a deal before it's too late!",Bob,6,
,,"This game is getting repetitive, Bob.  You're still trying to outwait me and snatch a better deal in the later rounds, but that's getting riskier for *you* every time. Tick-tock!",Alice,6,reject
50.0,50.0,"Bob, let's stop wasting time.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is the most rational choice, and it's only going to get worse for both of us if we keep playing this game.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,accept
