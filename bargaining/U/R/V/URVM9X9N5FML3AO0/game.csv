500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, we're both losing money with each passing round. It's time for a compromise.  A 50/50 split is the most fair and reasonable solution at this point. Let's end this game and split the money evenly.",Alice,3,

100000.0,900000.0,I'm not willing to give up the majority of the money. I think I've been patient enough and I'm willing to take a slightly higher risk to get a better deal.,Bob,4,

400000.0,600000.0,"Bob, this game is getting ridiculous. We are both losing a lot of money with each round. I'm willing to compromise again and offer a 40/60 split.  It's better than risking even more by continuing this cycle. Let's end it here.",Alice,5,
