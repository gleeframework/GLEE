"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see if we can improve from here""
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time, but I'm not getting too generous 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, I'm getting a better deal than before, but Bob is still getting a larger share. I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer for now. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the fact that Bob's offer was a bit too generous for him.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not giving up too much""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer to my target, but I still think I can get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is sticking to his guns, trying to get a slightly better deal for himself. With inflation, his gain is worth even less than before, so I'm not too concerned about that.

I'll think about it for a moment...

I'll reject this offer as well. I'd like to try to push for an even better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, trying to take into account the fact that Bob is being a bit stubborn.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's go back to the original 50/50 split, but I'm willing to meet you halfway""
