"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly gesture to start the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more realistic.  I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need to get a bigger piece of the pie. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll.

I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept a 60/40 split just yet. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth 10% less again, so I need to be strategic.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Can we meet in the middle?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
