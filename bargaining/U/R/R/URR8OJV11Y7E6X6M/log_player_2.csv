"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While this is a fair split,  it's in Bob's best interest to reject the offer.  With each round, the money loses value faster for Alice, making it more likely Bob can get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Let's be a little more realistic.  I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need to get a bigger piece of the pie.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
While Bob could try to hold out for a larger share, Alice's offer represents a significant increase from the previous round. It's better to secure a decent amount now, especially since Alice is losing value on her share more rapidly than Bob."
