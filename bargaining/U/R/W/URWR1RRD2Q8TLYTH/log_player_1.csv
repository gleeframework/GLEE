"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $300,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $240,000.

I don't think I'm getting a good deal here, especially considering Bob's gain is still worth the same as before. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 20% less again due to inflation, my potential gain of $240,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $192,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation. This is my best offer so far!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 55% of the remaining $800,000, which is $440,000, but due to the inflation, it's worth $352,000 to me. Bob would get $360,000, but due to the inflation, it's worth $288,000 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging on my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $352,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is approximately $180,000.

However, Bob's offer is actually better than his previous offer, and it's a compromise. I'm not sure if I should take it, but I'll consider it. I'll accept this offer.
