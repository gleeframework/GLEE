"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'm offering to take $55 and give Bob $45. My message to Bob is ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"". I'm trying to start with a relatively fair offer, but also taking into account that the money is worth more to me in the first round. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's speed things up. My turn to get a little extra. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept Bob's offer. Since the money is worth 10% less to me in this round, I'd rather try to get a better deal in the next round or make a counteroffer that benefits me more. Bob's offer is similar to mine in the first round, but the inflation has changed the value of the money, so I think I can do better. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 52, ""bob_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\nI'm taking into account that the money is worth 10% less to me and 5% less to Bob compared to the first round. Given this, I'm offering a slightly more conservative split, with me taking $52 and Bob taking $48. My message to Bob is ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle"", trying to appeal to his sense of fairness and the fact that we're both losing value as the rounds go on. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The rate is getting worse Alice, this is my last offer. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Considering the significant decrease in value for me (27.1% less than the first round) and the fact that Bob claims this is his last offer, I think it's better to secure the deal now rather than risking further losses in the next rounds. The difference between our proposed splits is relatively small, and I'd rather get something than risk getting nothing if we don't come to an agreement within the 12 rounds. Let's wrap this up! {""decision"": ""accept""}"
