Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Fair 60-40 split""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, which I believe is a reasonable starting point for the negotiations.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60-40, but I'll take the bigger share this time. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. Given that the money is worth 5% less for me in this round, I'd like to try and negotiate a better deal. Let's proceed to the next round and see if we can find a more favorable agreement.\n\n###\n\nPlease let Bob know that I've rejected his offer, and I'll make a new proposal in the next round."
