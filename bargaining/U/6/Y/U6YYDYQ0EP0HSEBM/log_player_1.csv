"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can avoid the 5% inflation penalty in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 6000 * 0.95 = 5700
* Bob gain: 4000 * 0.95 = 3800

I'll accept Bob's offer.
