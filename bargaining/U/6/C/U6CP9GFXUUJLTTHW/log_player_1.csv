Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.  This way, I can secure a large portion of the money early on and avoid the risk of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it seems tempting to take the $1000, the inflation rate is significantly higher for me than Bob. By rejecting, I can make a counter-offer in the next round and potentially secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than my previous offer, but still a substantial amount.  I'm hoping to incentivize him to accept, as I'm still facing a higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer.  Even though the inflation rate is hurting me significantly, I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. Bob's offer is too low, and I'm willing to risk another round to improve my share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway this time, offering him a larger share than my previous offer. While inflation is hitting me hard, I need to find a balance between securing a decent amount and avoiding another rejection."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

The inflation is really starting to bite, but I can't accept this offer. Bob is taking advantage of the situation, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep negotiating.  I'm still hopeful that we can find a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm trying to be more flexible this round.  Inflation is hurting me tremendously, but I'm offering Bob a larger share in the hopes he'll accept.  I need to find a way to secure some money before it's all gone."
