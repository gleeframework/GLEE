Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the current state of the game, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the inflation.

  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
