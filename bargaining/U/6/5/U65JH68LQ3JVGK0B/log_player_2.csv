Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but a 55/45 split is still more fair considering the different inflation rates. Let's reach a deal this round. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing willingness to compromise, the deal is still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the faster rate of inflation affecting my share.  It's worth risking another round to aim for a more equitable split."
