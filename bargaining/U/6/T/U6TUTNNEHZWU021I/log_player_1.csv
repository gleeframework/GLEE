"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good deal early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gains are worth 5% less, but Bob's gains are worth 10% less. This offer is actually quite even, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it for a moment...

I decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, and Bob's offer in round 2 was already worth 10% less than the original amount. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm taking a slightly larger share this time, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 525000 
# Bob gain: 475000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is getting worse! My gains are worth 14.26% less than the original amount, and Bob's gains are worth 27.1% less.

Considering the offers I've seen so far, this one is quite similar to the one in round 2, but with even less value due to inflation. I'll think about it...

I decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to make up for the lost value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 575000,
  ""bob_gain"": 425000
}
```

I'm taking an even larger share this time, but I'm not sure if it's enough to convince Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. My gains are worth 22.62% less than the original amount, and Bob's gains are worth a whopping 40.95% less.

Considering the offers I've seen so far, this one is still relatively even, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll think about it...

I decide to reject this offer.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to make up for the lost value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm going back to my original offer from round 1, but with the current value of the money in mind. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
