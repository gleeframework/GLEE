Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair.  It's a better deal for you than the last round, and it gives me a bit more.  Let's get this over with!  
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
