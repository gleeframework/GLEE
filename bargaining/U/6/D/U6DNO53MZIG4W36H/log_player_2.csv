Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. How about we split it 60/40 in my favor? We both get a significant chunk of the money, and it's a fair compromise considering inflation will reduce the value of the money with each round.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, I propose a 52.5% to me and 47.5% to you. This maintains a reasonable balance while accounting for the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000
