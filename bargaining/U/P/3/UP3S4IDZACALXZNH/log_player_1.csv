Let's start with a 60/40 split. This seems like a fair starting point, but I'm open to negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with this offer.  While Bob is willing to give me more than he originally offered,  the inflation means that my share is worth less than it was originally. I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 

I'm going to stick to my original strategy of proposing a 60/40 split, but I'll lower my share slightly to acknowledge the inflation affecting both of us.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."
