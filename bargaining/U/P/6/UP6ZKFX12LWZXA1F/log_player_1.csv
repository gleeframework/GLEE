I'm going for a high-stakes, high-reward strategy.  I'm confident I can get Bob to accept this offer, as he'll be getting something rather than nothing. Plus, if he rejects, I'll get to make the next offer and can adjust based on his reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a risky move, but I believe it's necessary. While Bob's offer is tempting, it's only worth $270,000 to me after inflation.  I have a strong negotiating position, as I can still get at least $270,000 in the next round. If I accept, I'm basically giving up almost $630,000 in potential future gains.  I'm betting that Bob will be desperate enough to offer me a significantly better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm going to stick to my high-stakes strategy. This offer is still a significant advantage for me, and I'm hoping that Bob realizes he needs to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

After inflation, this offer is worth $344,250 to me. While it's significantly less than what I was hoping for, it's still a substantial amount.  It's risky to reject again, as the potential future gains are shrinking rapidly due to inflation.  I'm accepting to secure a significant portion of the money before it's worth even less."
