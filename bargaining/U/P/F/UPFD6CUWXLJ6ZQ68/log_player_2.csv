**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value of the money is decreasing significantly.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal, especially as we're getting closer to the halfway point."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 510000, ""alice_gain"": 490000, ""message"": ""This is the best you'll get. Take it or leave it.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a last-ditch attempt to secure a slight advantage before the game becomes severely disadvantageous.  

* **Pressure:**  The message is framed as an ultimatum, hoping to pressure Alice into accepting. 
* **Slight Edge:** Offering just slightly more than half reflects a sense of urgency while still aiming for a marginal win.
* **Beyond this point:** If Alice rejects this, the value of the money will plummet further, making any future offers much less appealing. It might be time to consider accepting anything above a 50/50 split."
