"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a fair share, but I'm looking for a good deal for myself.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy! I'll give you a small portion, but I'm taking the majority. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, $100,000 is equivalent to $80,000 in the first round. That's not a bad offer, but I'm not sure if I should accept it.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still want a significant share. Let's meet in the middle!""

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the equivalent value of the offer in the first round. Since the money is worth 48.8% less for me now, $450,000 is equivalent to $281,400 in the first round. And $550,000 is equivalent to $385,000 in the first round.

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,

Do you accept this offer?","I'll calculate the equivalent value of the offer in the first round. Since the money is worth 67.23% less for me now, $300,000 is equivalent to $91,900 in the first round. And $700,000 is equivalent to $182,900 in the first round.
