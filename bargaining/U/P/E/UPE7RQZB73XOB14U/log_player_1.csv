"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here""
}
```

I'm proposing that we divide the $1,000,000 equally, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message is a friendly one, suggesting that we start with a fair split and see if we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, my effective gain is now $480,000 and Bob's gain is $630,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer, as I feel it's still too skewed towards Bob's gain. I'd like to make a counteroffer."

  ""alice_gain"": 420000,

}
