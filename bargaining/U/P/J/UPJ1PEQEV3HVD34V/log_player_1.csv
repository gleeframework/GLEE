"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the money with a ratio of 3:1 in favor of you, Bob. I believe this is fair considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split the money 60/40 in my favor. While I understand the value of money is decreasing, this offers a more even split and avoids further reductions in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
