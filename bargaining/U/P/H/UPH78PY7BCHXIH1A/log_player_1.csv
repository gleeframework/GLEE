"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a fair share considering the 20% devaluation of the money for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Split it down the middle, fair and square! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less now, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, splitting it down the middle seems fair, and it's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the remaining money. I'll accept this offer.
