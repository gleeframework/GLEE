Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 49 
# Alice gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is making concessions, time is working in Bob's favor. The longer the game goes on, the less value Alice places on her share due to inflation. Bob can likely secure a better deal in later rounds by continuing to reject offers that don't heavily favor him."
