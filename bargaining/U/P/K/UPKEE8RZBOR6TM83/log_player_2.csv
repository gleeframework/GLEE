"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the bigger share, but you get something too. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal!  While getting something is better than nothing, I'm confident I can negotiate a much better outcome in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""My turn for a stronger starting point. This offer ensures a more substantial share for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground. This offer is more balanced than the previous ones, and ensures a decent return for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is stalling, hoping I'll panic as the value decreases.  Her offer is slightly better, but still heavily favors her. I'll hold out for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This is a reasonable and fair offer. Let's settle this and both benefit."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, Bob. This offer is a compromise, and it's the best chance we have to get something before the money is worth nothing. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is right.  While not ideal, this offer is better than what I might get if I keep rejecting and the money continues to devalue. It's a compromise, and time is critically short."
