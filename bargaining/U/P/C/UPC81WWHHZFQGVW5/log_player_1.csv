"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 60/40, a good starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which I think is a fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I still gain $20, but for Bob, the money is worth 20% less, so he gains $64.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with Bob taking such a large share, especially since he's trying to negotiate after rejecting my initial offer. I'll reject this offer and make a new one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too generous, I'll make a counteroffer""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55/45, a compromise?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 55/45 split, trying to find a middle ground. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
