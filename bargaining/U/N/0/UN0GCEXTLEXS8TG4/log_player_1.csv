"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I think 3:1 is too extreme. This 30:70 split is a more reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{
