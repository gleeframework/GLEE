Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fairer, given that we both get a smaller share with each passing round. Let's try to come to an agreement quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55
