"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This seems like a fair starting point, given that I'm the one making the first offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even with the inflation, a 40/60 split is significantly worse than the 90/10 I initially proposed.  I'm hoping Bob will come back with a more reasonable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to stick with a 70/30 split in my favor, as it's still a better outcome for me than Bob's last offer.  This should be a good compromise, considering the inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer.  Even with the 27.1% inflation, I can do better than a 30/70 split in Bob's favor.  I'm confident I can negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This time, I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor. Considering the increasing inflation,  this is a more realistic offer, but still allows me to keep a majority of the money.  Hopefully, Bob will finally see reason and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but I'm going to accept this offer. Inflation has been hitting me hard, and  while I'd prefer a larger share, a 45/55 split is better than continuing to risk losing even more in the next round.  I'm hoping Bob will be more flexible in the future."
