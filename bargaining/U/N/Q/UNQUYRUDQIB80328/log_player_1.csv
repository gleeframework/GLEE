"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'm offering you $200,000. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This is a generous offer, considering I'm willing to give him a significant portion of the money right off the bat!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm offering you 40% of the money. This is a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting my gains!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. If I accept, I'll get $400,000, which is worth 80% of what I would have gotten in the first round. Considering the inflation, this is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should hold out for more.

For now, I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more. This is my new offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is still worth 80% of what he would have gotten in the first round, and I'm keeping $600,000, which is worth 60% of what I would have gotten in the first round. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
