Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a greedy strategy in the first round. I'll propose a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that Bob will have to accept if he wants to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While a 60/40 split isn't ideal, it's better than the 10% I'd get if I reject and we go to another round. With each passing round, the value of the money keeps dropping, and it's more beneficial to secure something now than risk getting less later."
