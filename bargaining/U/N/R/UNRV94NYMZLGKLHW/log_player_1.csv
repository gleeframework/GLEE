"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, giving me $8,000 and Bob $2,000. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to the ratio, let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my strategy considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because the ratio is still too skewed in his favor, and I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my proposal for Round 3 is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""A more balanced split, let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 3:2 split, giving me $6,000 and Bob $4,000. I think this is a fair and reasonable offer, considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Getting closer, but I want a slightly better deal this time! 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer this time. The ratio is still slightly in his favor, but the difference is relatively small, and I'd rather not risk waiting for another round and potentially losing even more value due to inflation."
