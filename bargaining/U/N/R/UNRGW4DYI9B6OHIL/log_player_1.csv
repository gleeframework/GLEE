"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a 50-50 split, a fair and reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is not a 50-50 split, I'll have to consider the impact of inflation. My gain of 4000 is still worth 95% of the original amount, while Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 90% of the original amount.

I'll reject the offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation.

Since the money is worth 90% of the original amount now (95% * 0.95 = 0.9025), I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's analyze the offer.

My gain of 4800 is worth 48% of the original amount (10,000 * 0.9526 * 0.7143 = 6847.2, then 6847.2 * 0.7 = 4781.24, rounded to 4800), and Bob's gain of 5200 is worth 52% of the original amount (10,000 * 0.9526 * 0.7139 = 6838.74, then 6838.74 * 0.76 = 5201.39, rounded to 5200).

This offer is closer to a 50-50 split, but still slightly biased towards Bob. Considering the inflation, I'll accept the offer.
