"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to negotiate if he's not happy with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, now it's my turn to be fair 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me, I now have to think carefully about the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think 20% is a fair share for me, especially considering the inflation that's affecting my end. I'll wait for Bob's next offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fair share to account for inflation.""
}
```

This time, I'm aiming for a slightly more balanced split, considering the effects of inflation on my end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting the better deal, but I'm willing to give you a small share 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'm in a tough spot. However, I don't think I can afford to reject another offer that's even more skewed in Bob's favor.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the 10% share, as it's the best I can get at this point, considering the effects of inflation."
