This is a classic bargaining game, and I'm going to start by being quite greedy. I'm offering Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it quickly to avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call! I'm getting a much smaller share, and the inflation is hurting me.  However, if I reject this offer, there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future.  It's a risky move to reject, and I'm better off taking what I can get."
