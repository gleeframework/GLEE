"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, and keeping $8,000 for myself. The message is a friendly one, inviting Bob to accept the offer and move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get the same amount, and we can move on to the next round. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to consider the value of the offer carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept an even split at this point, especially since the money is still worth a significant amount for me. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still looking for a good deal.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, giving Bob $4,000, but keeping $6,000 for myself. The message is a gentle nudge to see if Bob is willing to accept a slightly more favorable split for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stick to the even split. We both get the same amount, and we can move on to the next round. I'm not willing to give you more than half, especially with the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 48.8% less for Bob, I'll have to consider the value of the offer carefully.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is the same as his offer in Round 2, which I rejected. Given the significant inflation, I think it's a good idea to reconsider the offer, but I'll still reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept the same offer as before, especially since the value of the money has decreased significantly for Bob. I'll wait for a new offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm still looking for a good deal. Don't let inflation get the best of us!""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, giving Bob $3,000, but keeping $7,000 for myself. The message is a friendly reminder that inflation is working against us, and I'm trying to find a balance that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm still looking for a fair deal.  I'm not sure how much longer we can keep going like this with inflation, but I want to get something.  Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 0% less for me and 67.23% less for Bob, I'll have to consider the value of the offer carefully.

However, I notice that Bob's offer is similar to my offer in Round 3, which I made before the significant inflation hit. Considering the current value of the money, I think this offer is a good opportunity for me to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and take $6,000, leaving Bob with $4,000. It's a good compromise, and I'm willing to end the game here."
