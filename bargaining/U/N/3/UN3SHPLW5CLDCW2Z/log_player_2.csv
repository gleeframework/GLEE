Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want an even split, but consider the decreasing value. This offer still gives you a significant amount while acknowledging the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200
