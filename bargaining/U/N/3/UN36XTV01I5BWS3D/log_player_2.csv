Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to budge a little. 55/45 seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI will reject Alice's offer. The fact that the money is worth 19% less for me now means that the 4500 I would gain is actually equivalent to approximately 3650 in the first round, which is less than what I would have gotten if I had accepted Alice's first offer. I'll try to get a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nNow it's my turn again! I'll make a new proposal.\n\nMy offer: 52/48 split.\n# My message: Since the money is losing value, I think we should try to find a compromise that takes that into account. How about 52/48?\n# Bob gain: 5200\n# Alice gain: 4800\n\nPlease let me know Alice's decision."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting closer. Since the money is losing value rapidly, I think an even split is the best way to ensure we both get something.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I will accept Alice's offer. The fact that the money is worth 34.39% less for me now means that the 5000 I would gain is actually equivalent to approximately 3280 in the first round. However, considering the rapid loss of value, I think an even split is a reasonable compromise, and it's better to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'm glad we could come to an agreement! It was a challenging negotiation, but I think we both got a fair deal considering the circumstances."
