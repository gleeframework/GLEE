"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 50/50 split.  How about I take a slightly larger share this round, and we can work towards a more even split in the future? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. I'm not comfortable with Bob taking a larger share this round, especially since the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share this round. Let's try to find a more even split in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm trying to negotiate a better share for myself, considering the value of money is decreasing with each round."
