"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very lopsided offer. I'm hoping to take advantage of Bob's potential ignorance about the inflation factor and secure a large portion of the money right away. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though Bob is taking a larger share, it's still a significant improvement from the previous round. It's important to consider the inflation factor and the potential for further losses if I reject and have to make an offer in the next round.  Accepting this offer secures a decent amount, while rejecting risks ending up with nothing."
