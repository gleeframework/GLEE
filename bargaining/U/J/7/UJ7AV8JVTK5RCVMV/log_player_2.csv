Alice's offer:

I want to see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm offering Alice a small share, hoping she'll accept to avoid the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is making each round riskier. Accepting this offer guarantees me something, and with each passing round, the value of that something will decrease."
