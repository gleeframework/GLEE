"Round 1
Alice's offer:

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. The money is losing value quickly, and this is the best way to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split in round 3 is better than risking a worse offer from Alice in round 4 (where the value decreases even further) or hoping for a better deal from her in round 5 (if the game even makes it that far)."
