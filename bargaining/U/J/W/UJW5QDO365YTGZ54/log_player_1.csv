"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with an even split.  We can adjust the proportions later if we want to, but a 50/50 split seems like the fairest way to begin. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
