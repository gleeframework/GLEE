""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was quite unfair. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This accounts for the fact that I'm losing money at a faster rate with each round. Think carefully before rejecting, as the pot will be smaller for both of us if we continue.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your need for a larger share, but your offer was still too skewed. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. This is fair considering the rate of inflation and allows us to end the game without further losses.

# Alice gain: 650000
