900000.0,100000.0,"Let's split the money fairly. I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  This way, we both get a good amount, and we can end the game quickly.",Alice,1,

300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, your offer was quite unfair. Let's be reasonable. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This accounts for the fact that I'm losing money at a faster rate with each round. Think carefully before rejecting, as the pot will be smaller for both of us if we continue.",Bob,2,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I understand your need for a larger share, but your offer was still too skewed. I'm proposing a 65/35 split in my favor, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. This is fair considering the rate of inflation and allows us to end the game without further losses.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and the money is losing value quickly. My previous offer was already generous, considering I lose money at twice your rate. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is my final offer. If you reject this, I'm afraid we'll both walk away with significantly less.",Bob,4,
