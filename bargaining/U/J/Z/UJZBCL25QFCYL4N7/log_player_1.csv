"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to start with a slightly greedy offer, giving myself a 90/10 split. I figure Bob might accept it, but if not, I'll have a chance to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'm only getting $10, it's better than nothing, especially with the inflation. It's clear that Bob is going to be tough, and I don't want to risk ending up with zero."
