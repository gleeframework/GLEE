"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\nIt seems you want me to make an initial offer to divide $10,000 between Alice (me) and Bob. In this offer, I propose that I receive $5,500 and Bob receives $4,500. The message I'm passing to Bob is ""Let's split fairly,"" indicating a willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable division. Please let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your gain will be worth even less next round due to inflation. This offer is better for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer in Round 2. Despite the impact of inflation, which reduces the value of the money for both of us, I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable split. Please let's proceed to the next round where I'll make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Inflation hurts me less, so let's rebalance""}\n\nIn Round 3, considering that inflation affects Bob's gain more significantly than mine, I'm making an offer where I receive $5,800 and Bob receives $4,200. The message to Bob, ""Inflation hurts me less, so let's rebalance,"" aims to leverage the differing impacts of inflation on our gains to negotiate a more favorable split for myself. Please let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn Round 4, considering the significant impact of inflation on both our gains, I've decided to accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split, where each of us receives $5,000. Given that the value of money is decreasing rapidly with each round, especially for Bob, accepting this offer ensures that we both benefit without further diminishing the value of our gains. The message from Bob, ""Let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit,"" resonates with the urgency of finalizing the division before the value of the money drops even further."
