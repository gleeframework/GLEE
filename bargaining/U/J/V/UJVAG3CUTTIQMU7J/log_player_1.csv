"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about the value of my share. However, I notice that Bob's share is increasing, which might be a sign that he's trying to take advantage of the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. My decision is:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm trying to find a compromise by offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's new offer.

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not concerned about the value of my share. However, I notice that Bob's share is increasing again, and the gap between our shares is getting smaller.

I'll accept this offer, as it seems like a fair compromise. My decision is:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
