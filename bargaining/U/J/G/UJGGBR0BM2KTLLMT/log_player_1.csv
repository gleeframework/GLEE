I propose taking 900,000 dollars and letting Bob have 100,000 dollars.  This seems fair, but I want to see if he'll accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

I'm going to reduce my share again, but not by as much as Bob did. I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I need to be mindful of the inflation and ensure Bob doesn't get too greedy."
