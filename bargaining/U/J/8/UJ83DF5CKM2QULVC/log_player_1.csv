"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you can have 40%.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a relatively fair split. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your 50/50 split, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm taking the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 gain from the previous round is now worth $4,800 in the current round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit too close to a 50/50 split, and I'd like to negotiate further. However, since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be careful not to let the value of my potential gain dwindle further.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, my potential gain is now worth 80% of its original value, since it's been reduced by 20% twice.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more this round, but I'm still willing to compromise. I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,500 and keeping $5,500 for myself, trying to balance the risk of inflation with a reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more this round, but I think 55/45 is a fair split considering the inflation and the risk I'm taking. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 51.2% of its original value, since it's been reduced by 20% four times (20% reduction per round, with four rounds).

Considering Bob's offer, I think the 55/45 split is a bit too skewed in his favor, especially considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

However, I'm also concerned that if I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. So, I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that I can still get a better deal in future rounds.
