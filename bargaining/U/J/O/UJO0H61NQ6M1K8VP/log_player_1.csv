"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a fair share, now it's your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount, but it's a fair share considering the inflation factor. Now it's Bob's turn to make a proposal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, this way we both get a fair share, and we don't have to keep playing this game. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, the money is worth less now than it was in the first round. Since Bob is offering an even split, I'll consider it a fair proposal. I'll accept the offer.
