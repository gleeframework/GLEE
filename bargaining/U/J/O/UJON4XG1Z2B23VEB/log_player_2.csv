Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Alice's offer is still a 60-40 split, I'll accept it.
