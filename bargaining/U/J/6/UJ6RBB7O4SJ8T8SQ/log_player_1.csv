I propose to take 9000 dollars and let Bob have 1000 dollars. This is a fair starting point, as it offers a significant advantage to me, but still leaves Bob with something."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
