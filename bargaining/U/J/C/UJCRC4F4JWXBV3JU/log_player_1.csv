"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10.  This seems like a fair starting point, given the potential for inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get something, and the potential for further inflation means I might not get anything if I reject."
