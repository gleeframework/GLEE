Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. I need to hold firm and hope she gets more reasonable as we approach the deadline."

This is getting ridiculous. I'm not accepting anything less than a 45/55 split in my favor at this point.  She's playing a dangerous game."

# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is getting too risky. While it's not ideal, taking the $380,000 is better than nothing, which is what I'll get if we reach round 12 without a deal.  Alice is being incredibly stubborn, but I can't afford to gamble on her backing down."
