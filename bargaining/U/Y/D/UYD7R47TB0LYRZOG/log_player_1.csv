"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40%""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. This way, we can both get a decent amount and still have room for negotiation in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 50/50 split is the fairest way to start. Let's see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting the value of the money, my offer would be worth 5% less, so I would gain $5700 and Bob would gain $4500.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50/50 split, especially since the value of the money is decreasing. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round, so I'll gain $5,325 and Bob will gain $4,175.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being reasonable and leaving room for negotiation."
