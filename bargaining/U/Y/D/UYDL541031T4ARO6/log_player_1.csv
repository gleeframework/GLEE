"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a bold move. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get the entire $100, and Bob gets nothing. The message is a playful jab to see if Bob will accept a generous offer or try to negotiate."
