"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected 50/50, now it's time to make a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4000 is worth 90% of what it would have been in the first round, so it's actually worth 4500 in ""old money"".

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, since I would have preferred a more equal split. But I don't want to reject it and risk Bob making an even worse offer next round. I'll accept this offer for now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
