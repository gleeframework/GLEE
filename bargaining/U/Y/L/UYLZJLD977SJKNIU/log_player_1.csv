"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, keeping the bulk of the money for myself.  This gives me a strong starting point, but leaves room to negotiate if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 927272.73 
# Bob gain: 72727.27 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation hit my potential gains harder, Bob's offer is still significantly better than the 90/10 split I initially proposed.  Accepting this ensures I get a substantial share of the money, and avoids the risk of further rounds and potential for even lower offers."
