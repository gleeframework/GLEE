"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This way, I get 60% and Bob gets 40%. I'm being generous, but I'm also trying to set the tone for a fair game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better, I'm willing to give you a little more than you offered. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'd be getting $54 instead of $60. Bob's offer is a bit more generous, but I'm not sure I want to settle for less than I initially proposed.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair and reasonable offer."
