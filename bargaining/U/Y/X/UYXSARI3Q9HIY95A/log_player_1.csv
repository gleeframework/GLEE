"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering Bob a smaller share. I want to see if he's willing to accept a quick deal, or if he'll try to negotiate for more.  Since I don't know how the inflation will affect him, I want to get as much as I can early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While the inflation hurts me, I'm still gaining a good amount, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better deal in the future.  It's better to get something than risk getting nothing at all."
