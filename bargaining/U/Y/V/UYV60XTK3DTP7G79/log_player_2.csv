Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we need to reach an agreement soon.  This offer acknowledges the inflation impact while still providing me with a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### I will accept this offer. The impact of inflation is becoming increasingly significant, and prolonging the negotiations would only lead to further loss of value. This offer seems reasonable given the circumstances, and it's beneficial to finalize the agreement now rather than risking further devaluation of the money."
