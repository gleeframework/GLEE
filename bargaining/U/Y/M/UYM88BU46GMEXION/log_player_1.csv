Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to keep $9,000 and give $1,000 to Bob. I'm trying to maximize my gains in the first round, but I'm aware that the inflation rate will diminish the value of the money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is far less than my initial proposal, the inflation makes it unwise to keep rejecting offers.  Since my gains are only worth 90% of what they were in the first round, this offer still represents a significant amount of money. Furthermore, if I reject this offer, I risk losing even more money in the following rounds."
