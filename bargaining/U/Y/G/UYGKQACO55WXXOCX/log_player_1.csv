"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This offer gives Alice a larger share, but still leaves Bob with a significant amount.  It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to negotiate or if he'll want to try and get a better deal for himself in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what I was initially offering.  While I am losing some value due to inflation, it's not enough to justify accepting such a drastic reduction in my share. I'm willing to risk another round and see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a compromise here. While Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm still trying to get a fair share, but I'm also acknowledging that I'm facing inflation.  This offer gives Bob a larger share than my original offer, but still gives me the majority. Hopefully, this will be more appealing than his last offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still lower than what I'm willing to accept, even with the inflation factor. I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation, despite the decreasing value of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm willing to offer a slightly lower amount than my previous offer, considering the inflation, but I still want to secure a fair share.  Hopefully, this offer will encourage Bob to compromise and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to significantly impact the value of the money. Bob's offer is a 50/50 split, which is fair considering the circumstances. Accepting this offer ensures I receive something, even though it's less than I initially hoped for."
