Round 2

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. Inflation is affecting us both, and this is the fairest way to divide the remaining funds. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\nI think this is a good deal, considering the inflation. If I reject this offer, the money will be worth even less in the next round. I'll accept this offer and take the 5000 dollars."
