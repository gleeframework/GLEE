"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
I propose to keep almost all the money and give Bob just $1. Since inflation is in play, I want to maximize my gains in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
I accept the offer. Even though inflation is working against Bob, the 50/50 split is a fair and reasonable outcome.  It's unlikely I'll get a better deal in the next round."
