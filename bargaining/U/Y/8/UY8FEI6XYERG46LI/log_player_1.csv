"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 100,
  ""bob_gain"": 0,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This is a pretty straightforward offer - I'm proposing that I get all the money, and Bob gets nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A fair start, let's see if we can do better 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a good one, and it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
