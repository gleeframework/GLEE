"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25$ for me and 75$ for her, I'll make a counteroffer. I'll offer 80$ to her, which is a significant increase, but still less than her initial offer. This way, I'm trying to squeeze out a better deal for myself.

{""bob_gain"": 20,
""alice_gain"": 80}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 36 
# Alice gain: 64 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my expectations. Considering the reduced value of the money, Alice's offer is actually a relatively good one for me. I'll accept it.
