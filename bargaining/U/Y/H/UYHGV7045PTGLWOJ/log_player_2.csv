"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Let's start with a 90/10 split. You get the smaller piece this time, but the money gets worth less for you in the next round. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While a 10% share is tempting,  Bob can likely get a better deal in the next round.  He knows the money will be worth less to him if he waits.  It's in his best interest to see what Alice will offer next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, but I'm also aware of the decreasing value of the money.  Let's split it 60/40.  This way we both get a decent share and can avoid further losses.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to move closer to your offer, but I need a bit more to compensate for the continuing inflation. Let's split it 65/35. This way, we can both get a reasonable share and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's gains are significantly reduced due to inflation. While he may still be hoping for a better deal, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep rejecting offers. Alice's offer of 35% is a reasonable compromise, and accepting will prevent further losses from inflation."
