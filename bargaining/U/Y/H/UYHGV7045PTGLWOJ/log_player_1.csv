Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to be fair, but I'm also aware of the decreasing value of the money.  Let's split it 60/40.  This way we both get a decent share and can avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
