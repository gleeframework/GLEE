"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}

I'm offering 70 dollars to myself and 30 dollars to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less now, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

For round 1, I offered 70 dollars, which is worth 90% of the original amount. Now, I'm being offered 55 dollars, which is 55 / 0.9 = 61.11 dollars in terms of the original amount. This is less than my original offer, so I'll reject it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 20% of the original amount now (due to two rounds of 10% inflation), I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}

I'm offering 40 dollars to myself and 60 dollars to Bob."
