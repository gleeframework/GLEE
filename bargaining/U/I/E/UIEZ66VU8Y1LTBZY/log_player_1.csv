"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me the majority of the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50$ is actually worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is still less than my initial offer of 60$. I'm willing to accept a 50/50 split, so:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
