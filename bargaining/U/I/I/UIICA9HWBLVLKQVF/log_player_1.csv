"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. What do you think, Bob?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a pretty one-sided offer!

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to do better than Bob's previous offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which still favors me slightly, but not as much as Bob's previous offer. Will Bob accept?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob's offer is getting even more one-sided! I'm not going to accept that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to find a balance. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is closer to a 50-50 split than my previous offer. Will Bob accept this one?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting ridiculous! I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with just 10$.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more reasonable offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering a 70-30 split, which is still a bit biased towards me, but at least it's not as extreme as Bob's previous offers. Will Bob accept this one?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting out of hand! I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with just 5$.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more serious offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering a 80-20 split, which is a more substantial difference, but at least I'm not getting taken advantage of. Will Bob accept this one?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is getting absurd! I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with just 2$.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a final push for a reasonable offer. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 85,
  ""bob_gain"": 15
}
```

I'm offering a 85-15 split, which is still biased towards me, but at least it's not as extreme as Bob's previous offers. This is my last chance to make a deal, so I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is completely unacceptable. I'm not going to accept an offer that leaves me with just 1$.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

It looks like we've reached the end of the 12 rounds without a deal. Neither of us gets the money."
