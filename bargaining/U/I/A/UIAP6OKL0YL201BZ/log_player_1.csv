"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair to me. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less, the new amounts are:

* Alice's gain: 300,000
* Bob's gain: 700,000

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think I can do better than this. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding onto a majority of the money. Your turn, Bob!"
