I propose to take 900,000$ and let Bob have 100,000$.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I reject this offer. While Bob is offering me 100,000, my 5% inflation means it's worth less than the 100,000 I was originally offered.  He's trying to take advantage of the inflation and I'm not going to let him.  Let's see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to 800,000 for me, and 200,000 for Bob.  With inflation, this is still a better deal for me than his last offer, and hopefully he'll see that it's in his best interest to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject this offer. While Bob is offering me 200,000, my 14.26% inflation means it's worth significantly less than the 100,000 I was originally offered.  I believe I can do better than this, especially since he's facing even higher inflation. Let's see what happens next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to continue to lower my offer, but I'm still aiming for a decent share. With the inflation, 700,000 for me is still more than what Bob is offering, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if he finally accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I reject this offer.  Bob's inflation is taking a serious toll, and while he's offering me 300,000, it's worth much less than the 100,000 I was initially offered.  I'm confident I can do better, as he's increasingly desperate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to drop my offer further, but I'm still keeping a substantial majority. Inflation is hitting both of us hard now, but I'm still in a better position to absorb it. Hopefully, this will convince Bob to take the deal before we both lose even more money."
