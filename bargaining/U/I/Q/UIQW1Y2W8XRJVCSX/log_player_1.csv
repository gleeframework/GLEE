I'm going to offer Bob a small share, hoping he'll accept it quickly. If not, we'll play it out and see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is being very greedy! I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to try a 50/50 split.  Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair deal and we can both walk away with a decent amount."
