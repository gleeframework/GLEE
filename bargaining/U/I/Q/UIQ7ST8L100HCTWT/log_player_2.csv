"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money while it's still worth something. This offer ensures we both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a more even split is fairer, considering the value of the money is decreasing. Let's both get a decent amount while we still can.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer was more than fair in the first round.  Let's not drag this out. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, the value of the money is declining rapidly. It's better to accept a lesser amount now than risk getting nothing at all in the future."
