"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the values are now inverted, I'll have to think carefully. I'll accept Bob's offer.
