"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer represents a fair split considering the potential decrease in value due to inflation. Please consider it carefully. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's message highlights the potential for inflation, 300,000 is a very low share considering the potential for a larger gain in the next round.  As Bob, I'm going to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I believe this is a more equitable split, considering the possibility of inflation. Let's move forward and avoid further potential losses.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've adjusted my offer based on the inflation rate. This proposal aims to balance fairness with the risk of decreasing value. Please consider accepting to conclude our discussion. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to hurt. This offer is a reasonable split, considering the potential for further loss with another round of negotiation."
