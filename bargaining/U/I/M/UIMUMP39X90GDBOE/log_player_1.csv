Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, aiming to secure a quick agreement. I'm taking a larger share, but leaving Bob with something, hoping to avoid a protracted negotiation.  Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is making it less appealing to risk another round. Accepting Bob's offer ensures I get a significant amount, even with the inflation."
