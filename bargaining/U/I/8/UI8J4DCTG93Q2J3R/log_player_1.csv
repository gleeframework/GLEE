"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. This is a pretty generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it quickly so we can start enjoying our respective shares!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Given the inflation, my $800,000 from Round 1 is now worth only 80% of its original value, which is $640,000. And Bob's offer is now worth 90% of its original value.

Considering the new numbers, I'm not too thrilled about Bob's offer. I'd rather try to negotiate further.

I reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In Round 3, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer, considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money.

Since the money is worth 80% of its original value from Round 1, I'll aim to get a larger share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This way, I'm hoping to take advantage of the inflation and get a bigger chunk of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Let's calculate the effective value of the money:

* My original $800,000 from Round 1 is now worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8% = 51.2%).
* Bob's original $200,000 from Round 1 is now worth 72.9% of its original value (100% - 27.1% = 72.9%).

Considering the new values, I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer. I think I can do better.

I reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The game is heating up!

Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money even further, I'll aim to get a larger share. Since the money is worth 51.2% of its original value, I'll offer a slightly smaller share to Bob.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to take advantage of the inflation and get a bigger chunk of the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value!

Let's calculate the effective value of the money:

* My original $800,000 from Round 1 is now worth 32.77% of its original value (100% - 67.23% = 32.77%).
* Bob's original $200,000 from Round 1 is now worth 59.05% of its original value (100% - 40.95% = 59.05%).

Considering the new values, Bob's offer is actually quite generous compared to my previous offers. I'm not sure if I should take it or try to negotiate further.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
