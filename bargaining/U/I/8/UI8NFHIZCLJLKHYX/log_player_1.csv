Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the significant impact of inflation, accepting 4000 would still be less valuable than what I could potentially gain in a future round, especially considering the previous offers. Additionally, Bob's money is worth 40.95% less, making his gain of 6000 significantly less valuable than initially appears.

Do you accept this offer?
###\n\nAssistant:###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because accepting 3500, which is worth 30.23% less due to inflation, would be significantly less valuable than what I've previously offered or could potentially gain in a future round.

Bob's share of 7000 is worth 59.39% less, making his gain even less substantial in real value.
