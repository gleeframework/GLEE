"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 40%. This is a relatively generous starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who's really making the deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy with the 30% share I'm being offered, considering the initial offer was 60%. However, I don't want to risk going to the next round and having the money's value decrease further. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
