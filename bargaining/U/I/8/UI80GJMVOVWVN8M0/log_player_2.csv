Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing a lot of value with each round.  Let's split it evenly and call it a day.  It's the best we can do at this point. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000

**Reasoning:** While a 50/50 split isn't ideal given the faster inflation impacting my gains, accepting is the most logical choice at this point. 

* **Time Pressure:** We're past the halfway point with 7 rounds remaining.  The risk of walking away with nothing increases significantly if we continue to reject offers.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round sees the value of the money plummet, especially for me. Waiting for a better offer in later rounds might result in a smaller net gain even if I get a larger percentage.
* **Fairness:**  Alice offering a 50/50 split acknowledges the impact of the inflation on both sides. 

While I could gamble on getting a slightly better offer, the risk outweighs the potential reward at this stage. Accepting the 50/50 split guarantees a reasonable payout considering the circumstances."
