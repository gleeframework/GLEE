"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 40% and take 60%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, with me taking the larger share.  Let's settle this quickly and avoid the effects of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to take the smaller share, considering the inflation effect is more severe for me. I'd like to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
