"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This is a good deal for you. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is the first round and the offer is not fair.  I will propose a better division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's split it fairly.  I'm willing to give you a good share, but we both need to be reasonable.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out for both of us. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share,  Alice's offer is still better than what I would get if we continue to the next round. With the continued inflation, the value of the money will continue to decrease, making any future offers less appealing.  It's time to settle."
