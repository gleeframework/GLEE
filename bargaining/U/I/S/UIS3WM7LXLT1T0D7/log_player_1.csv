"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I'll start by offering Bob a tiny portion of the money, hoping he'll accept in the hopes of getting something. This way, I'll have the power to make the next offer if he rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer to have a larger portion, it's better to secure half of the money now than risk losing everything with further rounds."
