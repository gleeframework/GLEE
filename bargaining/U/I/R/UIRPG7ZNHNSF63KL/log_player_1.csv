This is my initial offer. I'm taking a larger share, but I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate.  Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm rejecting this offer.  I'm still hoping for a better deal, even with the inflation factor.  Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I'm offering an even split this time.  With inflation, both of us will get less than in the first round, but it seems like the fairest solution at this point."
