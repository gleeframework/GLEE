"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. Your turn!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $900,000, and Bob will get 10%, which is $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this round, but I think 60/40 is a better split for me. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 10% less this round, so my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $360,000 (0.9 x $400,000).

I'll consider Bob's offer. A 60/40 split is a significant concession from his previous 10% offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough. I'll think about it for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less this round, my gain of $400,000 in the previous round is worth $360,000. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this round, but I think 70/30 is a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 70% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $700,000, and Bob will get 30%, which is $300,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a smaller share this round, but I think 80/20 is the best I can do. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 27.1% less this round, so my gain of $700,000 in the previous round is worth $509,700 (0.727 x $700,000).

I'll consider Bob's offer. An 80/20 split is a significant concession from his previous 30% offer, but I'm not sure if it's enough. I'll think about it for a moment...

However, I notice that Bob's gain of $800,000 is still worth the same as in the first round, which is a significant advantage for him.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less this round, my gain of $509,700 in the previous round is worth $371,293 (0.727 x $509,700).

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share this round, but I think 60/40 is a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and Bob will get 40%, which is $400,000."
