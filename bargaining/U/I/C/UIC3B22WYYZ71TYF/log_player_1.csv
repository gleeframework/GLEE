"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a friendly message to set a positive tone for the negotiations. This opening offer allows room for concessions in future rounds while also testing Bob's expectations and willingness to negotiate. By framing it as ""Let's be fair!"", I'm appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and encouraging him to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be generous. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIn this round, considering the impact of inflation, the effective value of the money has decreased, but the proportions of the split remain a key factor in the decision. Bob's offer of a 40-60 split in his favor is less appealing due to the decreased value of the money, but it's crucial to consider the overall context of the negotiations and the potential outcomes of proceeding to further rounds.\n\nGiven that Bob frames this as his ""final offer"" and the decreasing value of the money with each round, there's a strategic decision to be made between accepting a less favorable offer now or risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds with the hope of negotiating a better split. However, Bob's assertion that this is his ""final offer"" introduces a risk that he might prefer to let the negotiations fail rather than concede further, especially since he knows the money's value decreases more significantly for me.\n\nConsidering these factors, accepting the offer now might be prudent, as it guarantees a gain, albeit a smaller one than initially hoped, rather than risking a potentially worse outcome or no agreement at all. Thus, the decision leans towards accepting to mitigate the risk of ending up with nothing due to the constraints of the game and the decreasing value of the money.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if you would like to simulate another round or stop here."
