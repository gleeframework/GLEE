"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money (90$) while still ensuring Bob gets something (10$). It's a starting point that gives me a good advantage, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than my original offer, even with the inflation considered. I still have the advantage in this game, so I'm going to reject and see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to 85 for myself, while still giving Bob something. This keeps me in a strong position, but shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 78 
# Bob gain: 22 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the inflation, I'm still getting a better deal with my previous offers. I'm going to reject and see if Bob will budge more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 82, ""bob_gain"": 18}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, but this time by a smaller margin.  I want to show flexibility but also make it clear I'm not willing to give away too much. This offer still gives me a good share, and it's more than Bob's last offer, so hopefully, he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 76 
# Bob gain: 24 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is really starting to bite, and I'm losing a lot of value with each round.  While I'd prefer more, this is the best offer Bob has made so far and the risk of getting nothing is too high. I'm going to accept."
