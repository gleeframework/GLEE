"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share, but you'll get a decent chunk. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's a decent starting point, but I'm going to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what I can negotiate!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better. Let's split it more evenly. What do you say?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share to make it worth my while.  Let's split it 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I think this is a good compromise. Alice is getting a larger share, but I'm still getting a decent chunk, and the inflation is starting to bite!"
