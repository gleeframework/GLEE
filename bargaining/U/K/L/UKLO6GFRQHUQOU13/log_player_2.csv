Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The inflation is hurting you more each round, and we're both losing out by dragging this on. I propose a fair 50/50 split to end this now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
