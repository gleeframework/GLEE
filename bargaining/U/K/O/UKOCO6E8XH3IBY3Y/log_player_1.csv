"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a small lead, but still leave you with a decent share. Consider this a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking effect, the money is worth less, but I'm still hoping to get a decent share.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 70-30 split, especially with the money being worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for a better offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more. Consider this a fair offer.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 42-58 split, trying to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the decreased value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm still not convinced that 35-65 is a fair split, especially since I'm already getting less due to inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for another chance to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need a bit more. Let's make a deal.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 45-55 split, trying to find a compromise that works for both of us."
