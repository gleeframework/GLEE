"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting with a fair offer, but we need to be smart about this. Inflation is a factor we need to consider. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer! While Alice is right about considering inflation, she's using it as a flimsy excuse to take the lion's share.  I'm confident I can negotiate a much better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but that offer was ridiculous. This is a much fairer split. Take it or leave it, but the pot shrinks every round.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still aiming for a larger share, but I'm willing to compromise. Let's find a way to split the money before we lose too much to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is playing hardball, but she's moving in the right direction. I need to hold firm and signal that I'm willing to let this go to the wire.  She'll be feeling the pressure of that 20% inflation much more keenly soon."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a reasonable compromise, and you're stuck on getting a massive advantage.  Let's end this now before inflation eats away at the value. Accept this offer, and we both walk away with something substantial.""
