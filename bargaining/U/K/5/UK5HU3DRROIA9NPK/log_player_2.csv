"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a terrible offer for Bob.  While 10,000 dollars is not insignificant, there's a high probability that Bob can get a significantly larger share by rejecting and making a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While the offer is still lopsided, it's significantly better than Bob's previous offer and the inflation penalty is starting to hurt.  The risk of getting an even worse offer in the next round is too high."
