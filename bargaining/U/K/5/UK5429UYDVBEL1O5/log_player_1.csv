"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get 450,000, which is 45% of the original $1,000,000. But due to inflation, it's equivalent to 45% of $950,000 (1,000,000 * 0.95). So, I'll actually get 0.45 * 950,000 = $427,500.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
