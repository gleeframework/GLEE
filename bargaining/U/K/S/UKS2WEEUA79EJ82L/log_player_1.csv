"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you $100,000, a fair share, and we can split the rest.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and leaves Bob with $100,000. My message is a friendly and generous one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. No need for complications. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth only $450,000.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with splitting it evenly, as I was hoping to get a slightly larger share. However, Bob's message does seem friendly and collaborative, and splitting it evenly might be a good way to end the game quickly.

I'll accept the offer.
