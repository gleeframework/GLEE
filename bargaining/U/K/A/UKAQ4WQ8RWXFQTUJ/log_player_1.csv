Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm offering Bob 100,000$ and keeping 900,000$ for myself. This seems like a fair starting point, giving Bob a small amount to consider while still leaving most of the money for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 375000 
# Bob gain: 625000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
While I would have preferred more, this is a much better deal than I would get if we keep rejecting offers. Taking into account the inflation, this is a reasonable offer, especially since the money is losing value more quickly for me than Bob."
