Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, I'm being generous 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing rapidly, I need to hold firm. Accepting this offer would mean I get less than half of the original amount, even before accounting for inflation. Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation and the dwindling value.  It's a high-risk, high-reward play, but I need to show I'm serious about getting a fairer share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Enough games, Alice. A 50/50 split is the only fair outcome. Take it or leave it.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The value is plummeting, and it's time to cut to the chase.  Offering a 50/50 split sends a clear message that I'm serious about a fair deal. It also puts the pressure on Alice â€“ if she rejects this, she's essentially gambling on getting a larger share of a rapidly shrinking pie."
