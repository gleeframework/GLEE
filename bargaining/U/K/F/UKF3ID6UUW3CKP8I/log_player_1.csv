This is my first offer. I'm taking the lion's share, but offering Bob a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I'm reducing my share slightly to make it more appealing to Bob, but still keeping the majority.  The inflation is starting to bite, so I need to be a bit more strategic this time."
