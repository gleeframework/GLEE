"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70% and you can take 30%""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but still willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think Bob's offer is very generous. With inflation, the money is already worth less, and I'd like to get a fair share. I'll reject this offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the value of money is decreasing with each round, I'll try to get a larger share now. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 850000,
  ""bob_gain"": 150000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a larger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise. You can take 15% and I'll take 85%""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a significant share, but I'm willing to give you a decent amount too. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out. With the money losing value at an alarming rate, I need to think carefully. However, 400,000 is a relatively small amount, and I'm not sure I want to risk going to the next round. I'll accept this offer.
