"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, giving me 70 dollars and Bob 30 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation rate. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, the new values are:

Alice's gain: 40 * 0.8 = 32
Bob's gain: 60 * 0.95 = 57

I'll accept Bob's offer.
