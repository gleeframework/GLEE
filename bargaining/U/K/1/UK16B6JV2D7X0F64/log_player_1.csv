"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob 450,000 dollars and keep 550,000 for myself, with the message ""Let's split fairly""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the first round, the actual value of the 450,000 dollars I'm being offered is 450,000 * 0.9 = 405,000 dollars. Considering this, I don't think the offer is fair enough, so I'll reject it.
### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll offer Bob 500,000 dollars and keep 500,000 for myself. However, due to inflation, the actual value of the money for me is 10% less than in the first round, and for Bob, it's 5% less than in the first round, and then another 5% less than in the second round. Considering this, I'll attach the message ""Considering the inflation, this is a fairer offer"".
