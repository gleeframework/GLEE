I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking on the risk of being the first to offer.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept it.  I'll take my chances and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try and get a better deal this time.  I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  Given the inflation, I think this is a reasonable offer and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still worse than my last proposal, and I'm not willing to accept it. The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm hoping to get a better deal if I keep pushing."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

The inflation is getting serious, so I'm going to offer a 50/50 split.  I think this is the fairest option given the circumstances, and I'm hoping Bob will finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not great, and I'm not willing to accept it just because we're getting close to the end.  The inflation is definitely making things difficult, but I'm going to try and hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm still hoping for a good deal, but the inflation is starting to bite.  I'm going to offer a 45/55 split in favor of Bob, hoping this will be enough to get him to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough one, but the inflation is killing me. Bob's offer is still not great, but I'm worried about the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds. I'm going to accept it and hope I haven't made a terrible mistake."
