"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose that I get $999,999 and Bob gets $1.  I figure this will be a good starting point to see how Bob reacts.  I don't expect him to accept this in round 1, but it will give me a better idea of how to proceed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair and reasonable offer. While I would have liked to get more, it's better to split the money evenly than risk getting nothing at all in the remaining rounds."
