"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the $100 and give Bob 30%. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'll adjust my calculation accordingly.

If I accept Bob's offer, I'll get $20, which is worth 20% of the original $100, which is a fair deal considering the inflation.

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
