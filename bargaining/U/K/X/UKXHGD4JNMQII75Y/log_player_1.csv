"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""A fair split, let's start with a good base""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, where I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can adjust as needed in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I still want a majority 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about whether this is a good deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a 30-70 split, I'll try to get a better deal. I'll propose a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""A slightly better split, let's see if you'll accept this one""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm getting closer to my target 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on my gains! With the money I gain being worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I'm getting desperate. Bob's offer is still a 25-75 split, which is not great, but I might have to consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal. Since Bob is getting closer to his target, I'll propose a 40-60 split, which is a bit more favorable to me.

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I want a bigger share""}"
