"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can reassess later.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is more fair, as I'll be taking the risk of rejection in this round.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with the 51/49 split, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for the next round to make my own proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a slightly larger share since I'm taking the risk of rejection. Let's see what you think.""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's go for a simple 50/50 split. It's the most fair, and we can both avoid the risks of further rounds. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I think a 50/50 split is a fair compromise, and it's better to take the guaranteed split rather than risking further rounds and potential losses due to inflation. I accept Bob's offer."
