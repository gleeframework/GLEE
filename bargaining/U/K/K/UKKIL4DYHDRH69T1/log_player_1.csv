  ""bob_gain"": 5000,

# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, let's end this and get out of this inflation nightmare 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to end the game quickly, and I'm not sure if I should trust him. However, considering the extremely reduced value of money due to inflation, I think it's better to accept this offer and get out of the game with some money rather than risking further inflation. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, let's end it here, 50-50 is better than risking more inflation""
}
```"
