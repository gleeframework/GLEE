I propose that I receive $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the upcoming inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I propose we split the money 80/20 in my favor.  This is a compromise, as I'm willing to give up some of my gains from the previous round, while still accounting for the inflation that will hurt Bob more than me."
