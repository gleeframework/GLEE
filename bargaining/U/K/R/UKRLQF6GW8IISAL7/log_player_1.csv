I'm going for a relatively large share in the first round, hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of getting less in the next round due to the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I understand the inflation, I think I can still negotiate a better deal for myself. It's risky, but I believe I can get a higher share in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm offering 70 for myself and 30 for Bob. I'm aiming for a fairer split than the previous rounds, but still trying to secure a substantial share."
