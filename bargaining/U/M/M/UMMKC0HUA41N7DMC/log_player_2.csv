"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50, Bob! It's a fair start. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject the offer.  While 50/50 is fair now, I know the money is worth less to Alice each round, so I can likely get a better deal for myself later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think 60/40 is a better split, considering the inflation we need to account for. Let's make this a quick deal!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 55/45 is a more reasonable split considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept the offer. While I'd prefer a higher share, the inflation will keep eating away at Alice's gains.  This is a good compromise that gives me a decent amount, and it avoids the risk of getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
