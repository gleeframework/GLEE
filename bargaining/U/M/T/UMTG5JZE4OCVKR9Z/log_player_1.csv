"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% of the total.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it down the middle.  We both get a good chunk and avoid the risk of losing money in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less due to inflation, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 450,000 (500,000 * 0.9)
* Bob gain: 450,000 (500,000 * 0.9)

I'm not thrilled about giving up 50% of the remaining money, but I think it's a reasonable offer considering the risks of future rounds. I'll accept this offer.
