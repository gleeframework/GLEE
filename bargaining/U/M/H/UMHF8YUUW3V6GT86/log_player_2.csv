Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my offer is more generous this time, don't be greedy 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800,
""alice_gain"": 5200,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer. It's important we settle this now before inflation eats away at the value any further. This offer ensures we both benefit.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said it's your final offer, but I'm still not satisfied. Inflation hurts you, not me. Take this or we'll keep playing 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the best option, even though it's far from ideal. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The money is losing value rapidly for Bob (almost 60% gone).  
* **Downward Trend:** Alice's offers have been getting worse for Bob, indicating she senses his desperation.
* **Unknown Future:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better. She might offer even less in the next round. 

While 3800 is much less than Bob hoped for, taking the sure thing is better than risking getting even less or even zero if the game continues."
