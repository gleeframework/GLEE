"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a generous 40% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than a 60/40 split. This offer is more balanced and still gives you a significant share. Let's end the game now. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less than the original $6000, which is $4800.

I'm not sure about Bob's offer. While it is more balanced, I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'd like to see if I can get a better deal. 

I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,800, which is a slightly larger share, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."
