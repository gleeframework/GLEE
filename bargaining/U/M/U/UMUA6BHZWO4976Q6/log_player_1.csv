"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. Given the rules of the game, where each round decreases the value of the money, starting with a slightly higher offer for myself gives room for negotiation while still being somewhat fair. The message ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more"" aims to set a tone of reasonableness, acknowledging that the offer isn't perfectly equal but is a starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting a bit more, but this is more equitable.  The clock is ticking. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the impact of inflation, accepting Bob's offer of $45 for myself in the second round means I'd actually be getting less value than if I had accepted a lower nominal amount in the first round. Considering the game's structure and the fact that we're only in the second round, there's room for further negotiation. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially finding a more favorable division or at least mitigating the effects of inflation on my gain."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm taking into account the effects of inflation on both our gains. By offering $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, I'm attempting to find a middle ground that considers the devaluation of the money over the rounds. This offer is also slightly more favorable to me to compensate for the greater impact of inflation on my side. The message aims to convey a willingness to compromise while also highlighting the urgency due to inflation, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
