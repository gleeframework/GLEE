"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's see how the offer from Bob changes with inflation:

* Alice's gain: $5,000 (10% less than $6,000)
* Bob's gain: $5,000 (5% less than $5,250, but wait, Bob's gain was $4,000 in the first round, so 5% of that is $200, making his new gain $4,200)

Considering the offer, I'll reject it. My gain is less than what I initially proposed, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this new ratio.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Let's make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, but with a slight nudge towards me""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slight edge, but not that much! 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

* Alice's gain: $5200 (27.1% less than $6,000, which is approximately 0.728 * $6,000 = $4,368, but 10% less than $6,000 is $5,400, so it seems there's been an error in the inflation calculation, I'll assume the correct inflation is 10% less than the previous round, so 10% less than $5,000 is $4,500)
* Bob's gain: $4,800 (14.26% less than $5,500, which is approximately 0.855 * $5,500 = $4,702.50, but 5% less than $5,250 is $4,987.50, so it seems there's been an error in the inflation calculation, I'll assume the correct inflation is 5% less than the previous round, so 5% less than $4,200 is $3,990, but it seems Bob's gain is actually $4,800)

Assuming the correct inflation is 10% less than the previous round for Alice and 5% less than the previous round for Bob, I'll accept the offer.
