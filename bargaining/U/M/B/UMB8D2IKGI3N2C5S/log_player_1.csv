"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share in the first round, hoping to secure a good amount before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's unlikely Bob will offer me more in the next round. With inflation, I'm better off accepting this offer and securing $1,000."
