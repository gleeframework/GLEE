"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, then we can negotiate from there.""
}

Round 2

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less, the actual amounts I'd be getting are:

* My gain: 4000 * 0.95 = 3800
* Bob's gain: 6000

I'm not thrilled about the uneven split, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.
