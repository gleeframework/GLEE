Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split it 50/50, but I'm not sure if it's too late 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would have preferred a larger share, it's getting risky with each round. Accepting the 50/50 split at this point secures a significant amount, and further rejections risk losing everything."
