"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, hoping to set a fair starting point for the negotiation. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer. Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

With the inflation effect, my gain of $4000 is worth 80% of what it was in the previous round, which is $4000 * 0.8 = $3200. Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of what it was in the previous round, which is $6000 * 0.95 = $5700.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the reduced value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

This offer takes into account the 20% reduction in value and gives me a slightly higher share to compensate for the loss. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll try to squeeze out a better deal. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money in this round:

My gain of $3500 is worth 35% of what it was in the first round, which is $3500 * 0.35 = $1225. Bob's gain of $6500 is worth 65% of what it was in the first round, which is $6500 * 0.65 = $4225.

Considering the significant reduction in value, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth significantly less than in the previous rounds, I'll aim for a higher percentage to account for the reduced value.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer, hoping to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the continued inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

My gain of $3500 in the previous round was worth $1225, so I'll aim for a higher value in this round. Since the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a gain that's worth around 25-30% of the original $10,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2500,
  ""bob_gain"": 7500,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to find a fair split, but I need to account for the inflation. Let's try this.""
}
```

This offer gives me a gain that's worth around 25% of the original $10,000, and leaves Bob with a larger share. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
