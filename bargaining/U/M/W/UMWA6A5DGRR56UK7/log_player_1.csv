"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, but I'm aiming to get a bit more than Bob, as I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm actually gaining more in real terms with Bob's offer than my original offer. I'll accept this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
