"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob.  Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I have an incentive to delay the agreement to get a better offer in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, since you're losing value each round""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I can try to take advantage of this by offering her less and keeping more for myself. This might prompt her to accept the offer before the money loses even more value for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a small cut to avoid further inflation, but I'm not giving up much more. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money still doesn't lose value for me, and Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation, I can continue to push for a better offer. Her offer of 55 for me is better than the last, but given the situation, I believe I can get an even better deal if I hold out longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""You're losing more value each round, I think this is a fair adjustment""}\n\n###\n\nGiven that the money continues to lose value for Alice but not for me, I'm in a strong negotiating position. I can continue to incrementally increase my share, as Alice is under pressure to accept an offer before the money loses even more value. My strategy is to keep pushing the boundaries to see how far Alice is willing to compromise."
