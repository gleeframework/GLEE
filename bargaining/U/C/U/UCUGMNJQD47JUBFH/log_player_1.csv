"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a 50/50 split. It's only fair that we divide the money equally, considering we're both playing the game together. I believe this is a reasonable offer, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
