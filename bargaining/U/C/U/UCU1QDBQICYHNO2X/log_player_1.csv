"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a small amount to keep the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'm more inclined to accept a 50-50 split. My gain is still worth 64 (80 * 0.8) in the first round, but now it's worth 40 (50 * 0.8) in the second round. I'll accept this offer.
