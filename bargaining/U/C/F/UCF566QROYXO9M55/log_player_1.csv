"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, we can both get something and avoid the risk of inflation eating into our potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A decent offer, but I think I can do better 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gains, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer that might not come.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
