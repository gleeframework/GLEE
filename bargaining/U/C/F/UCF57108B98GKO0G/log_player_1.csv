"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial 100$, which is 20 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 80 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fairer.  Let's try this and see if we can end the game. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 20% inflation, the effective value of the money is now 80% of what it was in the first round. So, if I were to accept Bob's offer, I would gain 40 dollars, but its value would be 80% of the initial 80 dollars I offered, which is 64 dollars.

However, I'm not sure what the value of Bob's gain is, since I don't know the inflation rate affecting him.

I'll reject the offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its initial value after the first round, and another 20% after the second round, it's now worth 64% of its initial value.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 32,
  ""bob_gain"": 68,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 68% of the remaining value, which is 68 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 32 dollars."
