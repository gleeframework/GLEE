"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, where we each get $50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking accordingly. If I accept this offer, I'll get $40, which is worth 95% of the original $50 I would have gotten in the first round.

On the other hand, Bob is proposing to get $60, which is worth 80% of the original $75 he would have gotten in the first round.

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think this offer is relatively fair. I'll accept Bob's offer.
