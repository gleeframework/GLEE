"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair! 50/50 split. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I have an incentive to try to get more than a 50/50 split. I'll reject this offer and try to propose a more favorable division in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll propose a division that is slightly more favorable to me, while still being reasonable for Alice. Since the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I want to try to get a bit more than half.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try 55/45. I'm willing to take a bit more risk to get a better deal.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the offer, but I think 55/45 is fairer considering the inflation on your end. Let's try that. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money is worth 19% less for me now, I need to consider the impact of inflation on my gain. However, Alice's offer of 45/55 is not in my favor, and I think I can try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to propose a more favorable division in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the inflation, I'll try to propose a division that takes into account the decreasing value of the money for me. Since Alice's offer of 45/55 is not acceptable, I'll try to meet her halfway between my previous offer and her offer.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. 50/50 considering the inflation.""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
