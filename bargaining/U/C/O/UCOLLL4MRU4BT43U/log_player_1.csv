"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think this is a good starting point.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair for us to split the money evenly, considering we both have an equal chance of making the final proposal. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me!

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast, Bob! You're trying to get a better deal now that you've seen my proposal. I'm not buying it. I'll make a new offer.""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the inflation. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me getting $550,000 and Bob getting $450,000. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
