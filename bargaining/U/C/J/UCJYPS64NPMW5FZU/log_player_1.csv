"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we both get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm effectively getting 50% of the original $10,000, which is $5,000.

However, Bob is getting 60% of the original $10,000, which is $6,000.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer was not to my liking, I'll make a new proposal.

Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, where I get a slightly larger share of the $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

Let's analyze the offer: Bob is proposing a 58/42 split, where he gets $4,200 and I get $5,800.

Considering the inflation effect on Bob's gain, his share is actually worth even less than in the previous round. On the other hand, my share is still worth the same as in the first round.

I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
