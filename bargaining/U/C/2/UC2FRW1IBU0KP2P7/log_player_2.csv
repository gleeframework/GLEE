Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. We'll split it 50/50.  Any more rounds and inflation will just hurt us both. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
