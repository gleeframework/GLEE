I'm starting with a very lopsided offer, hoping to get a quick resolution! 😜 Let's see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's a fair offer, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. Let's take the $50!"
