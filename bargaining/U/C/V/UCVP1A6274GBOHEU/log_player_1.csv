"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's flip the script from the last round. I think 60/40 is fair, and it's my turn to propose. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still heavily skewed in his favor. Since I rejected his offer in the first round, I need to be willing to hold out for a better deal in later rounds, even with inflation eating away at the total amount."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
