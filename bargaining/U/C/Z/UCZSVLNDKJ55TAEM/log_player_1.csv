"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000 and leave Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to reassess the offer.

My gain of 4000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is 3200.

I'll reject the offer because I'd rather have a higher amount in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In round 3, I'll aim to get a higher share of the money, considering the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}

I'm offering to take 70% of the remaining $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the effective value of my gain.

The initial $10,000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8%). 

My gain of 5000 is worth 51.2% of its original value, which is approximately 2560.

I'll accept the offer because it's a relatively fair split, considering the inflation.
