Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more reasonable split, considering the inflation. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Let's analyze why rejecting is the better move:

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, offering me even less than before!  He knows his share is decreasing in value faster.
* **My Leverage:** While my potential gains also decrease with inflation, I'm losing at a slower rate than Bob. Time is on my side to negotiate a better deal. 
* **Future Rounds:**  If I reject, I get to propose in the next round. This gives me the power to offer a split that's more beneficial to me. 

I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a fair share. Rejecting this offer will hopefully push him towards a more reasonable proposal in the future."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6400,
""bob_gain"": 3600,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. My previous offer was already generous. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""
}
```

**Strategy:**

* **Increased Demand:** I've increased my share slightly from the initial offer, showing Bob I'm serious about getting a larger piece of the pie.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By presenting it as my ""final offer,"" I'm hoping to pressure Bob into accepting. The longer this drags on, the more we both lose to inflation.
* **Leveraging Bob's Loss:** Bob's share is decreasing in value at a faster rate than mine. By now, he should be feeling the heat and more inclined to accept a deal, even if it's not ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm taking into account the increasing inflation and the fact that Alice's previous offer was not very generous. This is my counteroffer. Let's see if she's willing to compromise! 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting desperate and still trying to take advantage!  Let's break down why this rejection is crucial:

* **Insultingly Low:** Bob's offer of $4200 is drastically lower than even my initial offer of $6000. He's clearly hoping I'll crack under the pressure of inflation. 
* **My Losses Are Manageable:** Yes, inflation is eating into my potential gains. However, a bad deal is worse than a slightly smaller gain due to inflation. 
* **Final Round Leverage:** This is likely our last chance for a reasonable negotiation. If I reject, the next round will have the money worth so little that it won't be worth continuing.  My rejection sends a strong message: I'd rather walk away with nothing than be exploited. 

**Bob needs to realize I'm serious.** This rejection should force him to present a respectable offer in the next round if he wants any money at all."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, this is it. We've both lost some due to inflation, but this is the most reasonable offer you'll get. Let's end this before we lose even more.""
}
```

**Final Round Strategy:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've significantly lowered my ask from the previous round, signaling a willingness to compromise. This offer is a midpoint between our previous proposals.
* **Urgency and Finality:**  The message clearly states this is the last chance to make a deal.  The threat of walking away is very real now.
* **Appealing to Logic:**  I'm reminding Bob that further stalling only hurts both of us.  It's a final nudge towards a rational decision. 

**This is a calculated risk.** Bob may be stubborn enough to reject this, but it's unlikely. He's facing a significant loss if he doesn't accept, and this offer allows him to salvage a decent portion of the initial sum."
