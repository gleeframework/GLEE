Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 50

``` 

Alice is finally getting desperate and her offers will only get worse from here. Accepting the 50/50 split ensures I get a reasonable amount and don't risk walking away with nothing.
