"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split it 60-40. You still get a good amount!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $40, which is a significant amount, and I'm hoping he'll accept it since it's the first round and the money is still worth its full value. I'm trying to appear generous while still getting the larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is a fairer split, considering the inflation will impact us both. Let's be reasonable and avoid the risk of getting nothing. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not accepting Bob's offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next rounds. Since the money is worth less with each passing round, I want to try to get a larger share to compensate for the loss in value. I also want to see how Bob reacts to a bit of pressure, so I'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve the bigger share. Let's meet in the middle... sort of.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm trying to appear more flexible by offering Bob a slightly larger share than before, while still keeping the majority for myself. I want to create the illusion that I'm willing to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm actually just making a small concession to see how Bob reacts. The message is meant to be somewhat playful and light-hearted, to make Bob more receptive to my offer. Let's see if it works!"
