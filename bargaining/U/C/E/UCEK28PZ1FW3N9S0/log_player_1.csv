"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, given the inflation affecting my share. Let's try this and see if we can agree. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
