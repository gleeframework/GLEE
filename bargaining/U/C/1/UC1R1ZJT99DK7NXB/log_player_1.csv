Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. Your turn to respond.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. It's still fair, I think. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'm not sure if Bob is aware of the inflation, but I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a hit now!

Considering the significantly reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a smaller share, I think I can still do better. The difference between our offers is significant, and I'm hoping to get closer to a 50-50 split."
