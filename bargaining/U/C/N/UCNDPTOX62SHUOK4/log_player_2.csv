"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money. This offer benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### I'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. With the inflation, I'm hoping Alice will be more willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's compromise. We both get a good share.""}\n\n### I'm making an offer that is slightly in my favor, but still gives Alice a significant amount. Considering the inflation, I hope she'll be more inclined to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. Let's wrap it up and avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n### Considering the inflation and Alice's message that this is her final offer, I'm inclined to accept this proposal. The difference in the amount I gain compared to the original offer is not significantly worse, and further rounds will only decrease the value of the money for both of us. It seems prudent to accept this offer and conclude the game."
