Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This offer gives me a larger share of the money, but it still leaves a decent amount for Bob. I hope he sees this as a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less favorable to me than my initial offer. Even though the money is worth less now due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic reduction in my share. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a split closer to my initial offer, recognizing the inflation factor. This is still a fair division, considering Bob's offer in the previous round."
