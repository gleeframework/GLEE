"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}

This offer gives me the majority of the money, but still leaves Bob with a small share.  Since the money is worth less to Bob in subsequent rounds, this offer might be attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While it is an even split, I believe I can get a better deal for myself.  The money is worth less to Bob with each round, and I have the advantage of making the offer next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'm reducing my share slightly, but still offering a significant amount to Bob. Since the value of the money is diminishing faster for him, this offer could be tempting."

Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting more favorable to him, I believe I can still do better.  The money is worth significantly less to Bob with each passing round, so I will continue to leverage my advantage of making the next offer."
