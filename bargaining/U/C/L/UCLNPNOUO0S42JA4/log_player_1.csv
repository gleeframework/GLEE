"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this new offer.

I'm not sure if 60 is a good enough deal for me, considering the money is worth 5% less now. But I also don't want to wait too long and risk losing more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to...

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly weighted split in my favor, hoping Bob will accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I'm still not giving up too much! 
# Alice gain: 62 
# Bob gain: 38 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I need to think carefully about this new offer.

Considering the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, 62 is a relatively better deal for me compared to the 55 I proposed earlier. However, I'm still not sure if it's enough to accept, especially since the money is losing value so quickly.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The money is getting scarcer by the round! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger share, but I'm willing to make a deal!""
}
```

I'm pushing for a more significant share, hoping Bob will accept this time."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value rapidly! I need to think carefully about this new offer.

Considering the money is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, 70 is a relatively good deal for me, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'm also considering the fact that the money is losing value so quickly, and I might regret not accepting this offer later.

I'll decide to...
