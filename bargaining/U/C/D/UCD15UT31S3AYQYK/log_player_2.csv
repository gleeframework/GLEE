Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The longer we wait, the less we both get. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
