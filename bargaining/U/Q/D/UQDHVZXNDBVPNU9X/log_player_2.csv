"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

While it appears Alice is offering a ""fair"" split at face value, it's not in my best interest to accept. The inflation penalty is much harsher on me, so I need to aim for a larger share to compensate.  I'm willing to gamble that Alice will be more agreeable in later rounds to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, let's adjust the split 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is starting to recognize the impact of inflation but is still heavily favoring herself. I need to hold out for a better offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""This seems more like a fair split considering the inflation. Do you agree?""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is inching closer, but it's still not enough to offset the rapidly increasing inflation penalty.  We're getting into dangerous territory, but I have to hold firm."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.

Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5600, ""alice_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and we both lose if we don't agree.  This is my final offer.""}
