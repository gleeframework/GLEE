"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince I already offered a slightly higher amount to myself in the first round and Bob rejected it, I'm not willing to accept an even split, especially considering the inflation rate affects Bob more than me. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'll take a bit more. It's now or never!""}\n\n###\n\nI've increased my share slightly, considering the impact of inflation on the value of the money and trying to create a sense of urgency to pressure Bob into accepting the offer."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer benefits us both considering the inflation. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough the offer seems slightly more favorable to me than an even split, considering the increasing impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially on Bob's share, I believe I can negotiate for an even better deal. The fact that Bob is emphasizing the benefits of closing the deal now suggests that he might be getting anxious, which I can leverage in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you harder. This is my best offer.""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing pressure of inflation, especially on Bob's share, I'm taking a firmer stance by increasing my share again. The message is designed to emphasize the urgency and finality of my offer, aiming to convince Bob that this is the best deal he can get under the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! This is a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nDespite the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, Bob's offer does not sufficiently reflect the disproportionate loss of value on his share. Given the time pressure and the fact that Bob is emphasizing the reasonableness of his offer, I sense a growing desperation. I will reject this offer, anticipating that Bob may be willing to concede more in the next round to avoid losing everything."

Inflation is killing your share.""}\n\n###\n\nWith the increasing urgency due to the rounds passing and the significant impact of inflation, especially on Bob's share, I'm pushing my advantage by increasing my share once more. The message is crafted to emphasize the finality of the offer and the dire consequences for Bob if he doesn't accept, aiming to pressure him into agreeing to my terms."
