"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can avoid the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, Bob's offer is a bit more attractive to me now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of splitting it down the middle, as it's a fair deal and I don't want to risk waiting for a better offer."
