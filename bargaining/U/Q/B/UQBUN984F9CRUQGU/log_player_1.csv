"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  While my money is worth 5% less, Bob's money is worth 20% less. This means the offer is more favorable to me than it was in the previous round.
* **Fairness:** The offer is a 50/50 split, which is a fair and reasonable outcome.
* **Risk:** Rejecting this offer could lead to further rounds and more inflation, potentially resulting in a worse outcome for me."
