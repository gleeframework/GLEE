"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, slightly in my favor considering the inflation.  This will save us both time and money. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\n\nI can try to get a better offer in the next round. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be willing to make a more favorable offer to avoid further losses. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'll take the bigger share this time, considering you'll lose more value in the next rounds.""}\n###\n\nSince Alice's offer was slightly in her favor, I'll try to counter with a similar offer that's slightly in my favor. The message aims to create a sense of urgency, reminding Alice that she'll lose more value if she waits. Let's see how she reacts!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be real.  The inflation hurts, but dragging this out only makes it worse for both of us. 50/50 is the fairest and quickest solution. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\n\nAlthough a 50/50 split seems fair at first glance, I need to consider the effects of inflation on Alice's gains. Since her share is worth 19% less than in the first round, I might be able to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject this offer and see if I can get a more favorable proposal in the next round. The pressure of inflation is on Alice, so I'll try to use that to my advantage. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit more. You're losing value each round, so let's settle this soon.""}\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to increase my share while still leaving Alice with a significant amount. My message aims to remind her that time is of the essence, as she's losing more value with each passing round. I'm hoping she'll be willing to accept this offer to minimize her losses. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering you more than last time, and the clock is ticking.  Let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's offer is slightly more favorable to me than her previous one, I still think I can negotiate a better deal. With the inflation affecting her gains, she's losing a significant amount of value each round. I'll reject this offer and try to push for an even better proposal in the next round. The pressure is mounting on Alice, so I'll see how she responds to the increasing urgency. Bring on the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""The clock is indeed ticking, but it's ticking much louder for you. I'm willing to take a bigger share, considering the significant value you're losing each round.""}\n###\n\nIn this round, I'll try to increase my share again, while emphasizing the impact of inflation on Alice's gains. My message aims to drive home the point that she's losing substantial value with each passing round, and that it's in her best interest to accept my offer sooner rather than later. Let's see how she responds to this increased pressure!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to think you're enjoying watching the clock.  This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 5500 
# Alice gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n###\n\nConsidering Alice's message, it seems she's unlikely to make a better offer. With the inflation affecting her gains, she's already losing a significant amount of value. Since this is her ""final offer,"" I'll accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the 12 rounds. A 55/45 split is a reasonable outcome, given the circumstances. I'll take the $5,500 and end the game here."
