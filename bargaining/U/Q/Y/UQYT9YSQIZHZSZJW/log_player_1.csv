"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a simple split. I propose taking $6,000 while you get $4,000. This seems fair to me given the inflation we are dealing with.""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer was heavily skewed in your favor considering the inflation. Let's meet in the middle with a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Bob, I understand your point about the initial offer, but the inflation is significant.  I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be acknowledged. I propose $5,800 for me and $4,200 for you. This is a more reasonable adjustment considering the value decrease.""}"
