Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair offer considering I am the one initiating the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I propose a 55/45 split in Bob's favor. This is a compromise that acknowledges Bob's previous offer, and allows for a more equitable outcome considering the ongoing inflation."
