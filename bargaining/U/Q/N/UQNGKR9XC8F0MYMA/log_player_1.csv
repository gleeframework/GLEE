"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer for now. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account that the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair deal considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly larger share to myself, hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise."
