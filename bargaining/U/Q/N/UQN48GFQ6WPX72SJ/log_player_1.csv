"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share this round, but I'm still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 3000 / 0.9 = 3333.33
* Bob gain: 7000 / 0.8 = 8750

I'm not thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.
