"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money fairly, Bob. I think this is a good starting point. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm Bob, and I want to maximize my potential gain. While this offer is fair, I'm going to try to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. Let's split it 55/45, with me getting the larger share.  After all, I'm the one taking the risk of inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the fairer split considering the inflation. Let's be reasonable and close the deal. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Alice's offer is still not as good as my initial offer, and I think I can still get a better deal. I'm going to reject her offer and try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm sticking to my guns. Let's split it 60/40. I'm willing to give you a little more than my previous offer, but I'm still taking the hit from inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and be done with it.  The longer this goes on, the less you'll get anyway. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While an even split is tempting, I'm still confident I can get a slightly better deal. Inflation is hurting me, but I'm not giving up yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice. Let's compromise.  I'll reduce my ask a little to 5500, but that's my final offer.  We both need to make a decision now to get something before the inflation eats away at our gains any further.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, listen carefully. This is my final offer. I understand the pressure of inflation on you, but I'm also trying to be fair. Take this offer or we both risk ending up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 5100 
# Alice gain: 4900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While inflation is seriously impacting my potential gains,  Alice's offer is the best I've seen in a while.  It's getting risky to continue, and I don't want to end up with nothing.  I'll accept her offer."
