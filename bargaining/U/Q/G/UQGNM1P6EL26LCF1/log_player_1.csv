Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we should aim for a slightly more even split considering the inflation working against me. This offer still leaves you with a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  This factors in the inflation and still gives you a decent share considering time is running out.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out, and the inflation is hurting us both. This offer is a good compromise to ensure we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation working against him, and his offers are creeping closer to a more even split. However, I'm willing to play hardball a bit longer.  Time is a factor for me too, but I believe I can still secure a slightly better deal."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is ridiculous.  Let's just split it evenly and call it a day before we both lose out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is right, this is getting ridiculous.  While I might have gotten slightly more by pushing it even further, there's a real risk we both end up with nothing.  A 50/50 split at this stage is better than risking a total loss."
