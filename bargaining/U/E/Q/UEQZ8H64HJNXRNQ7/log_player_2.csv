"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting with a fair offer. Let's see what you think. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible offer for Bob! While starting with a seemingly ""fair"" approach might sound good, Alice is trying to take advantage of the steep inflation that affects her. Bob has time on his side."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Alice. The inflation hits you much harder. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better deal than that.  Let's split it more evenly. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is getting desperate, and her offer still heavily favors her. She's clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation. Bob can afford to hold out a bit longer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""The clock is ticking, Alice.  I'm offering a deal that accounts for the shrinking pot.  Take it before it's too late!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still hoping for a fairer split, but I'm starting to get nervous about the shrinking pot.  Let's work something out before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is finally showing some flexibility, but her offer is still not good enough. While she acknowledges the shrinking pot, she's not factoring in the disproportionate impact of inflation on her share. Bob needs to hold firm and continue applying pressure."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is as high as I'm willing to go.  We're running out of time, and this offer is more than fair considering how little your share will be worth soon!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're both losing a lot with each round, Bob. Let's split the remaining money evenly and end this before we lose everything! 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's finally time to accept. While not ideal, a 50/50 split is the best Bob is likely to get at this point.  

**Here's why:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds left, the pressure is mounting.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Both sides are losing money, but Alice is hit far harder. Waiting any longer risks a worse outcome for both.
* **Fairness:**  A 50/50 split, while not reflecting the initial advantage Bob held due to the inflation rates, is a reasonable compromise given the circumstances.

Waiting any longer is a gamble Bob doesn't need to take.  He can secure a decent share now before it dwindles further."
