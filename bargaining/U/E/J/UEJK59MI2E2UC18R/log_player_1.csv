"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose to take $9000 and give Bob $1000. This is a fair offer, considering the inflation rates, but it's also in my best interest to secure a large portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly less than my previous offer, and while the money I gain is worth the same, it's still not a good deal for me. I will reject this offer and continue negotiating."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm willing to compromise slightly, but I still want a larger share of the money.  I'm offering $8000 for myself and $2000 for Bob. This takes into account the inflation impacting Bob's gains, but still gives me a good deal."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his last one, it's still not a good deal for me. I'm holding out for a larger share, especially considering the declining value of the money for Bob."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500}

# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept, especially considering the increasing impact of inflation on his share. I'm sticking to my goal of getting a larger portion of the money."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm willing to compromise further to avoid the risk of losing everything, offering Bob $3000 and keeping $7000 for myself.  This reflects the declining value of Bob's share and the possibility of getting nothing at all."

# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  His share is worth much less due to inflation, but I'm not going to give up my position for such a low amount.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm offering a compromise again, offering Bob $3500, a significant portion of the remaining money despite inflation.  This shows my willingness to reach an agreement, but I'm still aiming for a larger share."

# Alice gain: 5000

While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's the best I can get at this point. The inflation is heavily impacting Bob's share, and we are running out of rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least half the money, which is better than risking getting nothing at all."
