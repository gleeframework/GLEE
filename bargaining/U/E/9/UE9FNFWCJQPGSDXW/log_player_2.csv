"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept being shortchanged right from the start! Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm offering a more equitable split, giving Alice a decent share while still ensuring I get a significant portion. Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still very unfair, even with inflation. I'm not going to accept such a small share. Let's see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to demonstrate flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a significant share. This should hopefully incentivize Alice to consider a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still not acceptable. The inflation is hitting me hard, and I need a bigger share to make it worthwhile.  I'm not giving up yet!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split. The inflation is making things difficult, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. This is a fair and equal solution, and hopefully Alice will see that."
