Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  You're not facing any inflation, and we both lose if this drags on.  This is my final offer for a reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700
