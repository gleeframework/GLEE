"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me getting 70 dollars and Bob getting 30 dollars. This is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, Alice! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less, my gain would be 70 * 0.95 = 66.5 dollars, and Bob's gain would be 30 * 0.95 = 28.5 dollars.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll think about it...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split!"
