While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:** The inflation is significantly impacting Bob. Every round that passes makes the $10,000 less valuable to him. While my buying power remains the same, his decreases rapidly. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's desperation to secure a larger share to offset inflation is working against him. He's gone from a 58/42 split to a 60/40 split in his favor, but the actual value he's getting is diminishing.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  If I reject this offer, there's a good chance Bob will panic in the next round and potentially offer me an even larger share. However, there's also the risk he'll offer me something much lower, hoping I'll cave under the pressure. Accepting the current offer guarantees me a reasonable sum."
