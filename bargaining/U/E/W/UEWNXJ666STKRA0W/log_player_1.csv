"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss more later""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to more interesting negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the potential for inflation. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4500 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, which is a 5% decrease.

I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is more fair, considering I'm already getting a smaller share due to inflation. I think I should get a bit more to compensate for the loss in value. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less than in the second round, my gain is worth 95% of what it was in the second round, which is a 5% decrease from the original amount.

I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4900,
  ""bob_gain"": 5100,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share. Let's meet in the middle""
}
```"
