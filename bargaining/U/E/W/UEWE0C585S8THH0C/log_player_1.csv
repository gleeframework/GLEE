Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a more even split. Considering the inflation rate is higher for me, I think this is a fair offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""alice_gain"": 6500,

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. This offer is closer to the middle, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to the middle, the inflation is disproportionately affecting him.  I need to push for a better deal before the shrinking pot makes it impossible."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time, and the inflation is taking a toll. I'm willing to split the money evenly, considering the circumstances. This is a fair deal for both of us, and I think we should take it before the money loses even more value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical choice.  Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point, and the rounds are running out. 
* **Significant Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing rapidly with each round. Bob is feeling the pressure more, making him more likely to settle. 
* **Future Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee I can secure a better deal in the remaining rounds. Bob might get desperate and start offering even less favorable splits.

It's a tough decision, but taking the sure thing at this point mitigates risk and guarantees a reasonable payout."
