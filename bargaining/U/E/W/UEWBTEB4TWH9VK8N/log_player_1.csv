"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\nI'll offer Bob 40% of the money and keep 60% for myself. This way, we both get a decent amount, and I'll explain to Bob that it's a fair deal. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you wanting to be fair, but this factors in the inflation over time. This way we both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI won't accept this offer. With the inflation, the money I gain is already worth less, and Bob is offering me even less than what I initially offered him. I'll reject this and make a new proposal that takes inflation into account.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob a bit less than before, considering the inflation that has already affected the money's value. I'll try to find a middle ground that we can both agree on. Hopefully, Bob will see this as a reasonable proposal and accept it.\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a better deal for you than last round considering the inflation.  Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll reject this offer. Although Bob claims it's a better deal considering inflation, I still think I can get a more favorable offer. The difference in the effect of inflation on our gains is significant, and I'll try to use this to my advantage in the next round.\n\n###\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Inflation affects me more, let's balance it out""}\n\n###\nIn this round, I'll emphasize how inflation affects me more than Bob and try to appeal to his sense of fairness. By offering a slightly better deal for myself, I'm hoping Bob will understand the reasoning behind my proposal and accept it, considering the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gain.\n\n###\n\n###"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Look, this is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nGiven the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, a 50/50 split at this point seems reasonable. I've lost a substantial amount of value already, and continuing to negotiate risks losing even more. Bob's offer ensures I get at least half, which, considering the circumstances, is a better option than risking further devaluation. I'll accept this offer to secure my share before the money loses any more value.\n\n###\n\n###"
