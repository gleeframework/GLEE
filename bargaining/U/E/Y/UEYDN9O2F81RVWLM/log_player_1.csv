Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of 40$ is actually 40 * 0.8 = 32$ in real terms.

I accept this offer.
