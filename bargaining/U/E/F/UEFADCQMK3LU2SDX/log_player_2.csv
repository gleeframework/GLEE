Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split considering the inflation.

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're getting close to the end, I think a 50/50 split is the most fair at this point.  Let's not lose everything. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

At this point, the game dynamics have shifted considerably due to inflation. While a 50/50 split wasn't ideal in earlier rounds, it's become increasingly attractive as time goes on. Here's why I decided to accept:

* **Significant Inflation:** We're at round 5 of 12, and the inflation is severe. Accepting 5000 now is better than potentially getting a slightly better deal later when the value has eroded further.
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice is unlikely to offer more than 50/50 at this stage. The longer the game goes, the more the inflation benefits her.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a marginally better deal carries a significant risk of walking away with nothing if we don't reach an agreement.

While not ideal, accepting a 50/50 split at this stage is the most logical decision to maximize potential gains in the face of rapidly decreasing value.
