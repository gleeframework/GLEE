"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a very unequal split, giving Bob just $1. My reasoning is that if he rejects this, he knows that in the next round he'll be forced to make a proposal, and he'll likely have to give me a much larger share to avoid getting nothing. This sets a strong precedent for me in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}

It's a fair offer, and it's better than risking getting nothing in future rounds."
