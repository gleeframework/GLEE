Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm hoping to get more in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money is worth less, and I need to be more aggressive in my negotiations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20% gain for myself, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
