I'm offering to take $60 and give Bob $40, with a message that hints at the fairness of the split, while also showing a bit of assertiveness. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the money will depreciate in the next round. Let's be reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

  ""alice_gain"": 58,
  ""bob_gain"": 42,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bit more, considering the depreciation""

I'm still trying to get a better deal, but also taking into account that the money is worth less now. I've reduced my initial demand, but still want a bit more than Bob offered in the previous round. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
