"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, but I'm leaving room for negotiation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is a fairer starting point. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 49 
# Bob gain: 51 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth less than before.

I'm not thrilled about the 49-51 split, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my desire for a larger share with the need to keep the game going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both have a chance to get something, and I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think splitting it evenly is a fair compromise, and I'd rather get 50$ now than risk losing everything."
