"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable""}\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $600,000 and leave $400,000 for Bob.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can find a slightly more equitable split. This offer accounts for the time value of money. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlice decides to reject Bob's offer, considering that accepting $550,000 in the second round, which is worth 10% less than in the first round, is not advantageous enough. She believes she can negotiate for a better share in the next round, despite the decreasing value of money for both parties. Alice aims to maximize her gain, taking into account the different rates of inflation affecting her and Bob."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 580000, ""bob_gain"": 420000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, this is a fairer deal""}\n\nIn this round, Alice adjusts her offer slightly, proposing to take $580,000 and leave $420,000 for Bob. Given the impact of inflation on the value of money for both parties, Alice's message suggests that her offer is a more balanced division, taking into account the devaluation that has occurred over the rounds. She aims to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and the urgency to settle before the money loses further value."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out, Alice. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 540000 
# Bob gain: 460000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nIn Round 4, considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of money for both parties, Alice decides to accept Bob's offer. The money is now worth 27.1% less for her and 48.8% less for Bob compared to the first round. Given the decreasing value and Bob's message indicating this is his final offer, Alice calculates that accepting $540,000 now is more advantageous than risking further devaluation in potential future rounds. She concludes that the certainty of this offer outweighs the uncertainty and potential loss of value in continuing negotiations."
