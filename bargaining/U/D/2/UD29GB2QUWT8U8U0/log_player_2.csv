Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offers are getting worse for her due to inflation, but they are not getting that much better for me. I need to push for a larger share while she still has a strong incentive to settle."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Time to be fair. 50/50. Take it or leave it."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're past the halfway point, and Alice's offers are getting more desperate as inflation eats into her potential gains.  A firm 50/50 split gives her something reasonable while also preventing me from having to take a worse deal later."
