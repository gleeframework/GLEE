"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that the money loses value for both of us over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is fair in the first round, it's important to consider the inflation factor. Since the money depreciates more for Bob, it makes sense to try and negotiate a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I appreciate your fairness, Alice. But since the money is worth less for me as time goes on, I'd like to propose a split that benefits us both, while still accounting for the inflation rate.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position with the inflation, but your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. This offer is a compromise, accounting for both our interests. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
