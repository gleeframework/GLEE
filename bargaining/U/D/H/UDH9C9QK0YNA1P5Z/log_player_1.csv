Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob.  I figure this will give him a good incentive to accept in the first round, and it leaves me with a significant share.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer.  I'm going to reject it and try to make a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to reduce my offer slightly, but I'm still leaving a good amount for Bob.  He rejected my first offer, so I need to be more realistic, but I still want to try to secure a large portion of the money. Let's see if he's more willing to accept this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse each round due to inflation. While I am starting to lose my patience, I will continue to reject until I get a better offer.  I need to be very careful here, as the next few rounds are going to be critical."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try one more time to make a deal with Bob.  This offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but it's still better for me than what Bob is offering. I'm hoping he sees that we're running out of time and accepts this deal before the inflation makes the whole thing pointless."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm going to accept this offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the money, and Bob's offer is more than what he was proposing in the previous rounds. It's time to cut my losses and secure a share of the money."
