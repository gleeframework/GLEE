"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more for my side. 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, the money is worth less now.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 30% gain for myself, even though it's a compromise. I'll try to negotiate further."

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 40% is the most I can offer. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the remaining $100, which is $40, and keeping 60% for myself, which is $60."

# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll, and the money is worth less with each passing round.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the 45% gain for myself, even though it's an increase from the previous offer. I'll try to negotiate further and aim for an even better deal."

  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. 50-50 seems fair, considering the circumstances.""

# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll now.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a slight improvement from my previous offers, and I don't want to risk going further into the rounds with the value of the money continuing to erode."
