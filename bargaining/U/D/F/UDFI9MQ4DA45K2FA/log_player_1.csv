"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair offer, given that inflation will be a bigger factor for me in the later rounds. It's a win-win as we both get a significant amount of money. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
