"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm going for a relatively aggressive first offer, aiming for most of the money.  Since I don't know how Bob perceives inflation, I'll see if he's willing to accept a small share to avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, accepting Bob's offer is the best choice. 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:** I've already lost 5% of the value of the money since the last round.  
* **Potential Loss:** If I reject this offer, I'll have to make a counter-proposal in the next round, and the value of the money will decrease further. There's no guarantee Bob will accept my offer, and the money I gain will be worth less.
* **Reasonable Split:** While 80/20 isn't ideal, it's a more equitable split than my first offer. It's reasonable to accept this and end the game."
