"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor. Since the money doesn't lose value for Bob, he might be inclined to wait, but I'm counting on him wanting to end the game early to secure a decent amount. The message is a gentle nudge towards acceptance, emphasizing fairness while still giving me a slight advantage. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. I think this is a fair split considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less for me now, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Accepting 45 would mean I'm getting significantly less than what I initially offered Bob, and I'm not ready to settle for that yet. I'll take my chances and make another proposal in the next round. Bring it on!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Inflation is kicking in, let's speed this up!""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a slightly more aggressive offer this time, taking into account the inflation that's affecting my potential gain. By offering 58-42, I'm still giving Bob a decent share, but also acknowledging that time is of the essence for me. The message is a gentle push to urge Bob to accept, implying that we should wrap up the game before the inflation gets worse. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's stop wasting time. This is a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll accept Bob's offer. Although I initially aimed for a better deal, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money for me. At this point, accepting 50 is a more sensible decision, as it guarantees me a decent amount rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Bob's message also implies that he's getting impatient, so I'll take this opportunity to secure a fair share and end the game."
