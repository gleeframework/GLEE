"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a small offer, but I'm willing to negotiate! 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better than 70/30. I'll wait for a better proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 45% of the reduced value of the money, which is a bit more generous than my initial 50/50 proposal. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up more, but I still want a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","With the significant inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be careful with my decisions.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can still do better than 75/25, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll wait for another proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the reduced value of the money, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give up more, but I'm not giving up too much! 
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","With the rapid inflation, the value of the money is decreasing significantly. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can still do better than 80/20, especially considering the reduced value of the money. I'll wait for another proposal from Bob, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of time running out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the continued inflation, I'll have to make a more aggressive proposal to try to get a better deal. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you a bit more!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 35% of the reduced value of the money, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm not sure if it's enough."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet, I'll give you a bigger share! 
# Alice gain: 85 
# Bob gain: 15 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer because, at this point, I think it's better to take what I can get rather than risk waiting for a better offer that may not come. 85% of the reduced value of the money is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we go to 12 rounds."
