"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Take 1,000 and let's negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a small amount to start, and keeping most of the money for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not starting too low, but I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to think! 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so I need to be more careful with my decision.

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer of 2000. I think I can do better than that.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less than in the previous round. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreased value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7500,
  ""bob_gain"": 2500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. Your turn to think!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to give you a bit more. Your turn to think! 
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money. I need to be careful not to get too greedy.

I'll think carefully about this offer... After considering the decreased value of the money, I think I can accept this offer. It's a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less valuable money.
