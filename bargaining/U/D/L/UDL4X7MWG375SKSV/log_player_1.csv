"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact""}\n\n### 

In this offer, Alice proposes to take 60% of the money, leaving 40% for Bob. She appeals to fairness, taking into account the inflation impact that affects her more significantly than Bob. This approach aims to find a middle ground that both parties might find acceptable, given the conditions of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a split that accounts for the inflation we're both facing. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n### 

In this response, Alice decides to reject Bob's offer. Given that the money's value decreases more significantly for her with each round, accepting 40% in the second round would be even less valuable than the original 60% she proposed for herself. She might be hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round or considering the strategic impact of further inflation on both their gains."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the increased inflation impact on me, let's find a compromise""}\n\n### 

In this round, Alice adjusts her proposal slightly, offering herself 58% and Bob 42%. Her message emphasizes the need for a compromise, especially considering the more significant impact of inflation on her potential gains. By slightly reducing her share from the initial proposal, Alice aims to make the deal more appealing to Bob while still trying to maximize her own gain before the money's value decreases further."
