"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a pretty generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can call it a day!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","My gain is still 700,000, but Bob's gain is now worth 20% less, so it's actually 480,000. I'll think about it for a moment...
