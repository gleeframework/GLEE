"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

``` 
I'm going for a bold first offer, hoping to secure a large share of the money early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in that easily.  I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, recognizing that I need to be more flexible to reach an agreement. While I still want a majority share, I'm willing to offer Bob a larger portion to avoid further rounds and the risk of more inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly greedy. While I'm facing significant inflation, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I won't accept such a lopsided offer. I'll see if he's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

The inflation is getting serious, and I need to secure a deal.  I'm offering an even split to avoid further rounds and the risk of losing even more money. It's time to compromise and see if Bob will accept this offer."
