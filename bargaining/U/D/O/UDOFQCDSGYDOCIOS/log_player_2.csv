Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still believe a more equitable split is possible. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000

Alice is incrementally increasing my share, which means she's likely feeling pressured by the time limit. I need to hold out for a better offer."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. With time running out, I think this is the best way to ensure we both get a reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is the best I'm likely to get. Accepting a 50/50 split now is better than risking getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
