Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage to her benefit.  While the difference between her offer and a 50/50 split is getting smaller, it's still in my best interest to hold out for a better deal for a few more rounds.  I'm hoping she'll start to feel the pressure of the shrinking pot as we get closer to the deadline."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 48,
""alice_gain"": 52,
""message"": ""This is a compromise - slightly better for you than a 50/50 split, but we need to agree soon before inflation eats away at our potential gains.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a slightly better deal for Alice than a straight 50/50 split, recognizing that she might be more motivated by getting slightly more than me. However, I'm also emphasizing the time pressure and the fact that inflation is hurting both of us. This offer aims to strike a balance between being reasonable and pushing for a deal before it's too late."

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is hurting you, not me. I'll take advantage of that 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","This is getting tight! Alice is playing hardball, but I still have some leverage.  

{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice's gloating aside, the difference between her offer and what I'd get with a 50/50 split is shrinking. It's risky, but I'm betting she'll get nervous as we get closer to the deadline and no one gets anything.  I need to signal I'm serious about holding out for a better deal."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 45,
""alice_gain"": 55,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We're running out of time. This is the same deal you offered in Round 1. Take it now, or we both risk getting nothing.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  We're past the halfway point, and the deadline for a deal is approaching fast. 
* **Highlighting Alice's Potential Loss:** By reminding her of her previous offer, I'm emphasizing that she's not in a dramatically better position now, despite the inflation working in her favor. 
* **Direct and Firm:**  I need to convey that I'm serious about my position and that simply waiting me out might not work in her favor."
