"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $3,000, which is a relatively small portion, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering your offer was a bit one-sided. Let's see what you think! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4,000 is actually worth $3,200 (since 20% less than $4,000 is 80% of $4,000, which is $3,200).

I'm not sure if I like the idea of giving Bob $6,000, which is worth $5,400 (since 10% less than $6,000 is 90% of $6,000, which is $5,400). I think I can do better than that.

I'll reject the offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up that much, let's try again""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 20% less than in the previous round, so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2800,
  ""bob_gain"": 7200,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you most of it, but I need something too""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $7,200, which is worth $6,240 (since 10% less than $7,200 is 90% of $7,200, which is $6,480, but I'll adjust it to $6,240 to account for the 20% inflation). This is a significant portion, but I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
