"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a decent amount, and we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll match your initial offer, let's see if we can do better from here 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, so I'll need to adjust my expectations.

Since Bob's offer is to match the initial offer, I'll consider it. However, I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal. But, I'll accept this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
