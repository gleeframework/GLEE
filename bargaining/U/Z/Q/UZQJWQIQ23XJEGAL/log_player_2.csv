"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money 3:2. This offers a fair balance considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though it seems fair on the surface, I can potentially get more money by waiting and proposing in the next round.  The inflation rate for Alice is higher, so she may be more motivated to accept a slightly less favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think this offer is fair considering the inflation rates. You lose 20% each round, so it's in your best interest to accept this deal.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose an equal split, considering the diminishing value of money with each round. This ensures both of us receive a fair share. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation rate is hitting Alice much harder than me. Accepting this offer ensures I get something and prevents the risk of getting nothing if she rejects my offer in the next round."
