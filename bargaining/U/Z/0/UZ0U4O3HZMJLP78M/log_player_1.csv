"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, recognizing that Bob has the advantage in this game due to inflation not affecting his share.  It's a reasonable starting point to see if Bob is willing to accept a relatively quick resolution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly worse than my initial offer.  I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can negotiate a more favorable split. Inflation is working against me, but I'm not ready to concede this much yet."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With inflation continuing to hurt my share, I'm proposing a 50/50 split. This is a fair offer, recognizing that Bob has the upper hand in this game.  It's also a risk for me, as Bob could easily reject it and secure a larger share in the next round. However, I believe this offer is a strong compromise and a good chance to end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is seriously impacting my share, and waiting another round will only worsen the situation. While I would prefer a more even split, Bob's offer is at least reasonable, giving me a significant portion of the money.  I accept to minimize further losses."
