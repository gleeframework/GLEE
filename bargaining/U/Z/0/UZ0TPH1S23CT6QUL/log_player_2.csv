"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split the money in a way that benefits both of us. This offer is quite generous considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is presented as ""fair"" and ""generous"", it's important to remember the inflation factor.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob the chance to propose a more favorable split in the next round, knowing that the money will be worth less to Alice in the next round.  By rejecting, Bob is taking a calculated risk to try and get a larger share of the remaining money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I understand the inflation affects you less, but I believe this is a fair offer considering the risk of continuing. Let's avoid losing money to inflation and make a deal.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You tried to lowball me, now it's my turn. Considering the inflation is affecting you more, I think this is a reasonable offer. Let's settle this before it gets worse for you. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is more advantageous to her than the previous one, it's still a significant loss for Bob.  The offer is still not accounting for the inflation rate impacting Bob much more than Alice.  Rejecting again gives Bob another chance to propose a more favorable split, knowing that the inflation will continue to work against him, but also against Alice, giving him a potential bargaining chip."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic.  Inflation is hurting me more with each round, and we're both losing money.  This offer is fair, and if we keep rejecting, we both risk getting nothing.  What do you say?""}
