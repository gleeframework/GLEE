"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, as I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round. My current offer was $6000, which is now worth 90% of its original value, or $5400. Bob's offer is $5000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer.

I'll decide to reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the next round, my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, which is 90% of $5400, or $4860.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200
}
