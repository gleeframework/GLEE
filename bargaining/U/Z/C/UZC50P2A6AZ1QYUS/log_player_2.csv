Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're getting desperate, but I'm not budging much. Inflation is really hurting your gains now. This is a good deal, all things considered. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**  Alice is correct that inflation is hurting my gains, but she's clearly trying to exploit the situation.  I need to show some resolve. Accepting an offer this low would set a bad precedent for future rounds."

Round 8

""alice_gain"": 520000,
""message"": ""Time is running out. This is my final offer - anything less isn't worth my time with the inflation working against me.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Show Resolve:**  Continuing to reject low offers demonstrates to Alice that I'm serious about getting a fair deal.
* **Deadline Pressure:**  With only 5 rounds remaining, the pressure is now on both of us. This offer highlights the time constraint and the increasing impact of inflation on my gains.
* **Slight Concession:** While still favoring me, I've slightly increased Alice's potential share to make it more tempting.  This could be enough to tip the scales in favor of acceptance."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting anxious, but I'm in the driver's seat here. Inflation is killing your gains, and time is on my side. This is a generous offer, considering. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** This offer is simply unacceptable.  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the situation and pressure me into accepting a terrible deal.  With only 4 rounds left, I need to hold my ground and hope she panics, because I'm willing to walk away with nothing if that's what it takes."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you're clearly not afraid to gamble.  This is my last offer - let's end this now and both get something.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

* **Finality:** With only 3 rounds left, I need to signal that this is truly my final offer. It's now or never. 
* **Concession, but Firm:** I'm conceding by going back to her original offer, but making it clear this is the absolute limit. 
* **Appeal to Logic:**  By highlighting the risk of both losing, I'm appealing to her rational side.  Does she really want to gamble on getting a slightly better deal in these final rounds?"

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your last offer, but I'm not buying it. Inflation is crippling your gains, and I'm not going to give in now. Take this or risk getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 320000 
# Alice gain: 680000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

I'm backed into a corner. While this offer is far from ideal, it's the best I'm likely to get at this point.  Alice knows I'm desperate, and with only two rounds left, the inflation will decimate my gains if we don't reach a deal now.  Better to take this than risk getting nothing at all."
