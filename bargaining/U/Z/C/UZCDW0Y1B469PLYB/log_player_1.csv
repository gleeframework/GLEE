"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can work together to get a good deal.""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the money, and we can start negotiating from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a more even split. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to take a slightly larger share, but I'm still open to negotiation. What do you think, Bob?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want a larger share, but this inflation is hurting us both. Let's split it evenly and avoid further losses. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth significantly less for me now, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and splitting it evenly might be the best option to minimize further losses.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
