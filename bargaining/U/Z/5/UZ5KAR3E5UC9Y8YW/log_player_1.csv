Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. This split accounts for the inflation and gives us both a good deal. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is much worse than mine! Since the value of money decreases for me with each round, I need to aim for a much larger share now to make up for the inflation.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is steadily increasing his share, but he's still lowballing me considering the rapid rate of inflation I'm facing. I need to hold firm.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be realistic. This offer is the most balanced you'll get considering the inflation. Take it before it's too late! 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on! Bob is steadily creeping closer to a 50/50 split, which would be incredibly disadvantageous for me given the inflation. While this offer is still slightly in my favor in absolute terms, I need to consider the time value of money.
