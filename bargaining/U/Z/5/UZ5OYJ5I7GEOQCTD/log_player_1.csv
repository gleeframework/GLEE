Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is a fair starting point, considering the inflation dynamic. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
