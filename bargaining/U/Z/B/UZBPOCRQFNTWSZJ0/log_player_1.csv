This is a classic game theory scenario! I'm trying to be fair but also secure a large share of the money. I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor.  Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy!  I won't accept his offer. I know that in the next round, I can propose a counter-offer and potentially get a better deal, even with the inflation. I'm confident I can get more than 100,000."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to stick to my strategy of aiming for a large share, but I'm willing to offer a bit more to Bob. This time, I'm proposing an 80/20 split in my favor. Since we're getting closer to the end, I need to be more flexible, but I still believe I can get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is playing hardball, but I'm not giving in!  This offer is even worse than his previous one. I'm still confident I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm going to stick to my strategy and try to secure a larger share.  The stakes are getting higher with inflation, but I'm determined to make the best of this situation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

The inflation is starting to hurt, but I'm still trying to get as much as possible. I'm going to offer Bob a 30% share, hoping he realizes that the longer we go, the less we both get. This is a bit more risky, but I believe it's the best chance to secure a good deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting ridiculous, and we're both losing money with each round. This is still a bad deal, but the inflation is making it tougher to hold out. I'm going to risk another round, but this time I might have to propose a closer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm taking a gamble here. The inflation is severe, and I need to act quickly. I'm proposing a 50/50 split. I'm not happy with it, but it's better than getting nothing.  Hopefully, Bob will see the logic and accept this offer."
