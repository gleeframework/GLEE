"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll decide whether to accept Bob's offer.

I'll calculate the effective gain for me if I accept this offer:

$400,000 * (1 - 0.05) = $380,000

And the effective gain for Bob:

$600,000 * (1 - 0.2) = $480,000

Considering the reduced value of the money, I think I'll accept this offer. I'll take $380,000 and Bob will take $480,000.
