"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is more fair considering the inflation advantage I'll have in future rounds. Let's reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
