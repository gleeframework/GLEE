"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a bigger share, but I think 60/40 is a fair starting point. Let's see if you can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
