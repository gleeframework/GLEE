"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my share of 550,000 is actually worth less than 600,000 in the first round. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering the numbers, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since Bob's offer was 550,000 for me, I'll try to do better this time. Here's my new proposal, taking into account the 5% inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 529000,
  ""bob_gain"": 471000
}
```

This way, I'll get a slightly smaller share, but still a bit more than Bob's previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is adding up! Considering the cumulative effect of inflation, my share of 520,000 in this round is actually worth less than 600,000 in the first round, and even less than 529,000 in the third round.

I'll think carefully about this offer...

After considering the numbers, I'll decide to:

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
