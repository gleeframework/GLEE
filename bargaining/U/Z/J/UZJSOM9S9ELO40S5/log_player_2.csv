"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I think a 60/40 split is reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't quite meet my expectations, and I believe we can find a more mutually beneficial split. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that I think is more reasonable, considering the decreasing value of money for both of us. Here's my proposal:

{""bob_gain"": 55,
""alice_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think 55/45 is a fairer split. Let's come to an agreement before the money devalues further!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be realistic. The value of the money is dropping quickly.  A 50/50 split is the most logical and fair solution at this point. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Given the rapid devaluation of the money, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable and fair solution at this point. If I were to reject this offer and proceed to the next round, the money would be worth even less, and I might end up with a worse deal.
