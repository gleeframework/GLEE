"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob wants to reverse the roles!

Considering the inflation effect, I'll calculate the actual amounts I'll get:

* My gain: 400,000 * 0.8 (20% less due to inflation) = 320,000
* Bob's gain: 600,000 * 0.95 (5% less due to inflation) = 570,000

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I'll accept this offer to move on to the next round.
