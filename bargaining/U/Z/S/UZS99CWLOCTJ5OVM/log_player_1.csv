Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing, so I'll think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject this offer.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation taking effect, I'll make a new proposal. Since the money is worth 40% of its original value, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the value of my potential gain decreasing rapidly, I'll think carefully about this offer.

Considering the rapidly decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer.
