"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55/45 split. It's a bit more for me, but still leaves you with a good chunk. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 55/45 split, and I'm not sure why Bob thinks I should get a ""good chunk"" of $450,000. I was hoping for a more equal split, and I'm not willing to accept a proposal that gives Bob a $100,000 advantage. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I still think this is a fair compromise.""}

I'm proposing a 60/40 split, giving me $600,000 and Bob $400,000. I'm trying to find a middle ground that is closer to my original 50/50 proposal, but still gives Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little less this time, but I think this is a fair compromise, considering the inflation. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 40/60 split, and I'm still not convinced that this is a fair compromise. I'm starting to feel like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 520000, ""bob_gain"": 480000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 52/48 split, giving me $520,000 and Bob $480,000. I'm trying to find a balance between my original 50/50 proposal and the 40/60 split that Bob has been pushing for."
