Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This is a much better offer for me, and you still get a sizable amount before inflation eats away at it. 
# Alice gain: 150000 
# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
