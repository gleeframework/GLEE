"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. The message is a friendly one, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
