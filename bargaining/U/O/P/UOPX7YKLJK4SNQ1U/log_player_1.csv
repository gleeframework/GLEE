"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 7-3 split, a good starting point! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $600,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, so it's $480,000. And Bob's offer is a 7-3 split, which means I'd get $300,000 and Bob would get $700,000.

I'd rather not accept this offer, since I'd be giving up a significant amount of money. I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my $480,000 from Round 2 is now worth 80% of its value, so it's $384,000. I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 42-58!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 42% of the remaining $1,000,000, which is $420,000, and leaving $580,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 55-45 split, a bit more in my favor this time! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $384,000 from Round 3 is now worth 51.2% of its value, so it's $196,608. I'll evaluate Bob's new offer.

Bob's offer is a 55-45 split, which means I'd get $450,000 and Bob would get $550,000. Considering the inflation, my $196,608 is now worth 49.2% of its original value, so it's $96,512. I'd be getting a significant amount more than that, so I'll accept Bob's offer.
