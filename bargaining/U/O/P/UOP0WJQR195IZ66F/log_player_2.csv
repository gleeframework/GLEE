Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

This is a tough one, but I have to cut my losses.  Alice is clearly aiming to maximize her gain and is content to wait me out.  Each round significantly decreases the value of my potential winnings. Accepting now is better than risking even less in future rounds."
