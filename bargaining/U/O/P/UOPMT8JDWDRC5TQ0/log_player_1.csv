Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5800,

**Reasoning:**

It's crucial to analyze the game's dynamics to make informed decisions:

* **Inflation:** The rapidly decreasing value of the money incentivizes a quick agreement.
* **Bob's Behavior:**  Bob's rejection of a relatively fair offer in Round 1 and his attempt to take advantage of the situation in Round 2 suggest he might be aiming for a larger share than what's proportionally reasonable.
* **Finality:**  This is likely the last round where I can propose a deal that benefits me more than simply accepting Bob's inevitable offer in Round 4. 

**The Offer:**

* **My Gain:** 5800 (devalued to 4640 after this round)
* **Bob's Gain:** 4200 (devalued to 3780 after this round)

**The Strategy:**

* This offer is a calculated gamble. It's slightly less than what I proposed in Round 1 but still gives me a larger share. 
* The message aims to convey a sense of urgency and finality, pushing Bob to accept. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** We both benefit from ending the game with a reasonable split.
* **Bob Rejects:**  In Round 4, Bob will likely propose a split heavily favoring him. I'd be forced to either accept a poor deal or see the money's value decrease drastically in further rounds."
