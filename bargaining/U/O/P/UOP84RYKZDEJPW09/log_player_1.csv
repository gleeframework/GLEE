"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000
}
```

This way, I'll get 40% and Bob will get 60%. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of my potential gain has decreased due to inflation.

I'll think about Bob's offer... Hmm, it's not as good as my initial offer, but it's better than going to the next round with a further decrease in value.

I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
