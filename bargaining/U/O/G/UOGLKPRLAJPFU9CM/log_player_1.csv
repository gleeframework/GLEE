"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to get the negotiations started!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better. I'll take 6000, and you get 4000.  Let's see if this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth 80% of the original $5000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $4000.

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer, so I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of the original $5000 (80% of 80% = 64%), so I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to get a good deal too. Let's see if this works for you.""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly larger share for Bob, while keeping a significant portion for myself."
