I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer. He's trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't let him get away with such a lopsided deal. I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7200, ""bob_gain"": 2800} 
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant amount, to try and find a middle ground. Since I rejected his offer, I want to show that I'm willing to compromise, but I also need to ensure a fair return for myself."
