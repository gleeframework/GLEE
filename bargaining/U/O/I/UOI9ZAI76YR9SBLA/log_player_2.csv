Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  I'm willing to split it 950,000 for me, 50,000 for you.  It's a better deal than your last offer, and it avoids any more inflation hurting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
