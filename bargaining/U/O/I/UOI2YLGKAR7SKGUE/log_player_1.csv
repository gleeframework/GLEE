"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $400,000. Your turn!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You were too generous, let's try to get more for myself 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get more money.

I'll reject this offer. My gain of $250,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $750,000 is still worth 100% of what it was in the first round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 95% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit greedy, Bob! Let's try to find a fair split. I'll give you $450,000 this time.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 55% of the value of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will get 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to take advantage of the inflation.

Since the money is worth 85.74% of its original value after four rounds of inflation (95% * 0.95), I'll reject this offer. My gain of $200,000 is worth 85.74% of what it was in the first round, while Bob's gain of $800,000 is still worth 100% of what it was in the first round.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 85.74% of its original value, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here it is:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to give you all the power, Bob! Let's try to find a fair split. I'll give you $510,000 this time.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 49% of the value of the original $1,000,000, and Bob will get 51%."
