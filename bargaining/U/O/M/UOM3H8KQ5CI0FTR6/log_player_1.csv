"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to take 900,000$ for myself and give 100,000$ to Bob.  This is a fair offer that still gives Bob a significant sum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
```

I propose to take 850,000$ for myself and give 150,000$ to Bob. This is a slightly lower offer than the first round, but still fair considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is significantly lower than what I was initially aiming for, considering the inflation and Bob's increasingly aggressive proposals, accepting this offer is the most strategic choice.  Continuing to reject offers could lead to even more losses in the future.  It's better to secure a significant portion of the money than risk ending up with very little."
