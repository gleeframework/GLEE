"Round 1
Alice's offer:

This is a terrible deal for Bob. Even with the inflation, it's better to keep playing and see if a better offer comes along."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100 
# Alice gain: 999900 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is a bit better than the first round, it's still a bad deal for Bob.  The inflation is hurting, but it's still worth continuing to play and see if a better offer comes along."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 800000, ""alice_gain"": 200000}
``` 
This is a more balanced offer, taking into account the inflation.  It's likely to be a more attractive option for Alice than the previous rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Even though the offer is slightly better than the previous round, the inflation is making it harder to accept.  There's still a chance for a better deal in the future.  Rejecting allows Bob to potentially get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 700000, ""alice_gain"": 300000} 
``` 

This offer is still taking the inflation into account, while also being slightly more generous to Alice than the previous round.  It's a risky move, as the inflation is continuing to impact Bob more significantly with each round, but it's a gamble that might pay off."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10000 
# Alice gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

The offer is getting better in terms of the absolute amount Bob is getting, but the inflation is severely impacting the value of that money. There are only a few rounds left, so it's better to keep playing and see if Alice gets desperate enough to offer a more substantial share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000}
```

This offer keeps pushing the boundary on what Bob is willing to offer, but it also recognizes that the clock is ticking. Alice needs to realize that if she keeps rejecting, she risks getting nothing at all."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a tough call, but with only 3 rounds left, and the inflation decimating the value of the money, it's probably the best deal Bob can get at this point.  While Alice gets a much larger share, Bob is getting a significantly larger portion than the previous rounds, and he's at least getting something.  The risk of getting nothing at all is too high to keep rejecting."
