"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal where we both benefit. This offer ensures you get something now, rather than risking it all later as inflation eats away at the value. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is tempting, I believe I can get a better deal.  The inflation rate will work against me in later rounds, so I need to secure a larger share.  Let's see what Alice proposes in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""I'm willing to share the wealth, but I need a more significant portion to make it worth my while.  This offer allows us both to profit, and I believe it's fair given the risk of inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a significant share, but my previous offer was already generous.  This deal is a compromise, reflecting the decreasing value of the money over time. Let's close this deal now and both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is a significant factor. Accepting this offer ensures I get a substantial amount, and delaying further risks losing even more to inflation. It's time to secure what I can."
