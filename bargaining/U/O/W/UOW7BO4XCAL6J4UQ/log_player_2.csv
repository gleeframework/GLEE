"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I think this split reflects the fact that we both lose money if we wait. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair split, considering the money depreciates faster for you than me. Let's get this done!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The money is losing value fast, Bob. This is my final offer - let's be reasonable and end this. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
The money is depreciating quickly, and I'm not sure I can do much better in the next round. It's best to accept this offer and get something."
