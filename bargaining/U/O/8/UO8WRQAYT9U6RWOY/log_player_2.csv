Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle of our last offers, 56-44. Let's end this. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting impatient, she's clearly feeling the inflation pinch more than Bob.  It's likely she'll be more willing to concede in the next round or two as the value of her potential winnings continues to plummet. Bob still has a strong negotiating position."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both benefit.  The clock is ticking!"" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Moving to a 50/50 split is strategic at this point.

* **Time Pressure:** With only 6 rounds left, the pressure is mounting. A firm but fair offer could push Alice to accept.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While Alice's share is decreasing, it's unlikely she'll get a better deal at this stage if Bob stays firm. A 50/50 split is better than risking a complete loss.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  Offering a 50/50 split shows Bob is willing to negotiate and be fair, potentially making Alice more receptive to the offer."
