"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. Take this offer before inflation eats up your share! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make my proposal. The current offer doesn't seem fair to me, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that I think is more reasonable, considering the inflation that will occur if we don't come to an agreement soon.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. I'm being generous, but this is my final offer! 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer. Considering the inflation that has already occurred and the fact that Alice claims this is her final offer, I don't want to risk losing even more value by going to another round.
