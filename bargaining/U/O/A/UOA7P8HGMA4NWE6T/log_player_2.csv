Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:** While the deal is getting worse, accepting now would mean losing a significant chunk of the potential money due to inflation. It's worth holding out a little longer and seeing if Alice gets more desperate."
