Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the upcoming inflation 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is now worth 20% less, the effective value of $400,000 for me is actually $320,000. Considering this, I don't think Bob's offer is fair enough. I'll reject it and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, I'll make a new offer!"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nConsidering the inflation, I'll make a new offer. This time, I'll offer Bob $450,000 and take $550,000 for myself. Since the money is worth less for both of us now, I'll try to find a middle ground.
