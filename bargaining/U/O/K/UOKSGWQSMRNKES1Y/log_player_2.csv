**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly trying to anchor me to lower offers. While this is closer to a reasonable split, I believe I can still negotiate for more as we approach the halfway point of the rounds."

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  Meet me in the middle or we both lose! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**  

While I'd prefer a slightly higher amount, Alice is right - this is getting ridiculous. We're past the halfway point and approaching the endgame. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant sum, whereas continued negotiation increases the risk of walking away with nothing."
