This is my first offer, I'm going for a fair but slightly advantageous split to start. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer, even with the inflation.  I'm going to try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly to account for the inflation.  I'm still aiming for a slightly advantageous split, but I'm hoping Bob will realize it's in his best interest to accept this offer rather than risk getting even less in the next round."
