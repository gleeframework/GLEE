Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is more than fair 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Inflation is eating into our potential gains. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed a factor, but let's not forget the initial value 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (Bob), accepting $38 is still too low. Alice is clearly aiming to maximize her gain and taking advantage of the inflation working against me.  I need to push for a more favorable split while there's still a reasonable amount left to negotiate for."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""This is a compromise, Alice.  We both need to benefit before inflation eats away any chance of a decent agreement.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the time and inflation, this is a reasonable adjustment 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting dire. With each round, the value of the money I receive diminishes significantly. While $35 is far from ideal, rejecting this offer means risking even less in future rounds. Alice is unlikely to offer a significantly better deal, and the potential loss from further inflation outweighs the possibility of a slightly better offer."
