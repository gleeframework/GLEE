"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining $2000 later""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the initial $10,000, which is a good starting point. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next step."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair split, considering the inflation affects you more. Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $4000 is actually worth 80% of $4000 from the previous round, which is $3200. This is a significant reduction.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the inflation affects me more. I'd like to think about it for a moment.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a better share to account for the inflation""
}
```

This offer gives me $3000, which is worth 75% of the original $4000 I would have gotten in the previous round, considering the 20% reduction due to inflation."
