{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 60 and you can take 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point. Let's see if Bob accepts!"

# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not sure a 50/50 split is the best option for me, especially considering the inflation rate. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 45-55 split, but I'm also not sure if I can do better. Considering the inflation rate, I'm willing to take a chance and try to negotiate further. I'll reject this offer and hope to get a better deal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 40-60 split, but I'm also running out of time and options. Considering the inflation rate, I'm starting to feel like I might not be able to get a better deal.

I'm trying to be bold and take a chance, hoping that Bob will see the value in my proposal. I'm proposing a 68-32 split, which is a bit more aggressive than before. Let's see if Bob accepts!"

I'm getting desperate, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I think I can do better than a 42-58 split, considering the inflation rate. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further in the next round. I'm running out of time, but I'm still holding out hope for a better deal."

I've been rejected so many times, and I'm running out of options. I think I have to accept this offer, even though it's not my ideal split. 44-56 is not ideal, but it's better than nothing. I'll take this offer and hope that Bob will keep his word. This is my last chance to get something, and I'm willing to take it."
