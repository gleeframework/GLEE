Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we need to find a compromise. Let's split it evenly at 50/50.  The devaluation hurts us both, but dragging this out only makes it worse, especially for me. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
