"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair start, let's see if you can do better!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch it up, I think this is a more balanced split.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced that Bob's offer is a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation. I was hoping for a better split than 40-60. I'll keep trying to negotiate!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle! A 50-50 split is a fair compromise, don't you think?""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even distribution of the remaining 100$."
