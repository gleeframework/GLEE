"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and I'll take the remaining 80%. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair split to begin with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal this time 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking.

In the first round, I was offered $20, which was worth 20% of $100. Now, in the second round, I'm being offered $60, which is 60% of the current value of $100. This is actually a better deal than the first offer, considering the inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
