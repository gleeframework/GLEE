Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll give you a bit more than last time, but I still think I deserve more 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I should get the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is inching closer to a more even split, time is running out.  It's better to hold out for a better deal and hope Alice gets more desperate as the rounds progress. Accepting now would mean losing over a third of the potential value due to inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time! This offer is more than fair. Take it before we both get nothing!""}

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't go below 54 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but the risk of getting nothing is getting high.  We're past the halfway point and inflation is eating into the potential gains. Accepting a 46/54 split now is better than getting nothing in a few rounds, even if it's not the ideal outcome."
