Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable.  I'm proposing a more equitable split. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing it all to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
