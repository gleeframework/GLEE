"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```
I'm offering to take 80% of the original $100, leaving Bob with 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I still need to make a living!

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
