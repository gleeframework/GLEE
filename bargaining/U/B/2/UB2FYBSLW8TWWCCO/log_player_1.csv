"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and give you a larger share, but I think 4:6 is a more reasonable ratio considering the risk and uncertainty of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
