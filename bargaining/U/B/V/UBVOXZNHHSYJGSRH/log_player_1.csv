"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the stakes. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. Since the offer is to meet in the middle, I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

In this round, my gain would be 5000, which is worth 80% of the original amount, considering the 20% decrease in value due to inflation.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
