{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, I'll start""}

I'm proposing that we split the $10,000 evenly, with each of us getting $6,000 and $4,000 respectively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started, now it's my turn to make a better offer! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll need to adjust my decision. Considering the new values, I'll accept Bob's offer.
