"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm going for a pretty aggressive opening offer, aiming for a large share of the pie. Since Bob's money depreciates slower, I think he might be willing to take this deal rather than risk losing more in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and although the value of the money is decreasing, I still think I can secure a better deal. I'll reject this offer and see what Bob offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly from round 1, but still offering a significant share of the money. The decreasing value of the money means Bob might be more likely to accept a deal before it becomes even less valuable for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is starting to take a significant toll on the value of the money.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a 50/50 split, which is better than the risk of getting nothing if we continue to reject each other's offers."
