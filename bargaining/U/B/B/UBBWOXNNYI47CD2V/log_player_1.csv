"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the majority""}

I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer since it's a decent split, and we can both walk away with a significant amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about giving up more money, but Bob's offer is a decent one. I'll accept his proposal:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
