"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer...

Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about the inflation. However, I'm not thrilled about the 60-40 split, as I was hoping for a more even distribution.

I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 60-40, I'll try to counter with a slightly more balanced proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering a 55-45 split, which is closer to an even split than Bob's previous offer. Let's see if Bob accepts this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still a 55-45 split, but now the money he gains is worth even less than before due to inflation. I'm not thrilled about the split, but I'm starting to run out of options.

Considering the reduced value of Bob's gain, I'll decide to...

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
