Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose taking 90% of the money, leaving Bob with 10%. This is a fair starting point considering the inflation rates.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is terrible! Even with the inflation, I'm getting drastically less than I was originally offered. I'll reject this and make my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to try to split the money more evenly this time.  While I'm still losing value with inflation, I think this offer is more fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 260200 
# Bob gain: 739800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting even worse with each round. Even with inflation, I'm losing a huge percentage of the money, and he's taking a larger and larger share. I'll reject this offer and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I'm going to try a more even split again, but this time I'll give Bob a larger share to see if he's willing to compromise. Even though I'm losing a significant amount due to inflation, I'm hoping this will be enough to get us closer to an agreement."
