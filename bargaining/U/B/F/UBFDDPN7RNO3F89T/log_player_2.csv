Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going any lower.  Let's agree on a 55/45 split,  considering the inflation is affecting us both. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's offer seems reasonable, I'll wait for a potentially better opportunity, considering the game has just started and inflation might pressure Alice into offering a more favorable split in the future."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation is impacting me more, I think a 58/42 split is a fair adjustment, giving us both a reasonable share.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I'm not going lower than 5300 for myself.  Let's split it 53/47 to avoid further losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation and the risk of getting nothing if we don't agree within the 12 rounds, Alice's offer of a 53/47 split seems reasonable at this point. It's better to secure a deal now rather than risking further devaluation of the money or the possibility of not reaching an agreement within the remaining rounds."
