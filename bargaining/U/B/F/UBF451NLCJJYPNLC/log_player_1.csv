This is a fair starting point. Let's see if Bob is agreeable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm not going to accept such a drastic drop in my share, especially since the money is worth less for me. I'll make a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'll offer to take a slightly smaller share, but I'm still holding out for more than Bob's last offer.  I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to be completely taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am still not satisfied with this offer.  While my gains are worth less, I am not willing to accept such a significant reduction in my share.  I will make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'll try meeting Bob halfway, but I'm still feeling the pressure of inflation.  I hope this offer will be more appealing to him."
