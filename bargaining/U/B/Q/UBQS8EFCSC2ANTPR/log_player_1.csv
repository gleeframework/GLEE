"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see if Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual value I'll receive.

My proposal in Round 1 was 5000, which is worth 90% of its original value in Round 2. So, if I accept Bob's offer, I'll be getting 4000, which is worth 90% of 5000, or 4500 in terms of the original value.

I'll accept Bob's offer for 4000. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
