"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll start with a fair split, let's see if you can do better!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You said it was a fair split, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

}
```

I'm proposing a new split, taking into account the decreased value of money due to inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
