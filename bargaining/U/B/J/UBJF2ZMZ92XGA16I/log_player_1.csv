Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose taking 90 dollars for myself and giving 10 to Bob. This ensures a good starting point for me and leaves room for negotiation if Bob decides to reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
``` 

I'm willing to compromise a bit by offering Bob 15 dollars. While this is still favorable to me, it's a step closer to a potential agreement.  I hope this is enough to convince him to accept the deal."
