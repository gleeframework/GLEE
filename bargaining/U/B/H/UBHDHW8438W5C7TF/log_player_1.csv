"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40. It's a fair start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think we can do better. Let's split it 60-40 in my favor, reflecting my higher risk in this round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting twist! With inflation, the value of the money I gain remains the same, but the value of the money Bob gains decreases.

I don't think I'm willing to accept a 60-40 split in Bob's favor, especially since the risk is not explicitly defined. I'll try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not so fast! I'm not convinced about the risk being higher on your side. Can you explain what you mean by 'higher risk'?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time for my next proposal!

Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob due to inflation, I'll aim to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll propose a slightly higher share for Bob to account for the reduced value of his money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to give you a bit more. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split.""
}
```"
