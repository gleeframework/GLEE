"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split, I think we can work together from here. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's risky to accept a deal where Alice gets 6000 and I only get 4000, especially considering the potential for inflation. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fair.  Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I should get a bit more considering the initial offer I made. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While I'm losing value with each round, accepting this offer would be a huge loss. It's worth pushing for a better deal, especially as Alice seems willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4000, ""alice_gain"": 6000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but I need to ensure a reasonable return for myself as well. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.""}
