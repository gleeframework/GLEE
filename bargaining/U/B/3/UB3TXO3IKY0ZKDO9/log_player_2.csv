Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer to get more, the inflation is starting to hurt and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  Let's call it a day."
