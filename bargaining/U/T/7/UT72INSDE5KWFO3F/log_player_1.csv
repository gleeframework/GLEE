"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 7:3, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 7:3 split, with me getting $7,000 and Bob getting $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, my friend! 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, the money is worth less than before. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I think I can do better than a 60:40 split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob compared to the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6300,
  ""bob_gain"": 3700,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 63:37 split, with me getting $6,300 and Bob getting $3,700."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's call it a draw, I'm happy with this split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rates, the money is worth significantly less than before. I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. A 50:50 split is fair, and I don't want to risk going to another round with the money being worth even less."
