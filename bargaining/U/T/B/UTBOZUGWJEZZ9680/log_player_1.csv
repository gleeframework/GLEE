"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I propose a division of $90 for me and $10 for Bob. This way I get a good amount, and Bob still gets something.  We can move on from here, but I'm happy to negotiate if you have another offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower amount for myself, but still significantly higher than Bob's last offer.  This should be attractive to Bob, especially since the money is worth less with each passing round. I hope we can reach an agreement this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While this offer is significantly less than what I hoped for, the value of the money is now much lower due to inflation. It's better to accept this offer than to risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
