"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000 and leaving $2,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 5% inflation, the $4000 I would gain in this round is actually worth $3800 in real value.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, considering the significant reduction in my potential gain. I'll reject it.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation and the previous rejection, I'll make a new offer. Here it is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm offering to take a slightly larger share this time, but still leaving a substantial amount for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the $4500 I would gain in this round is actually worth $3849.80 in real value.

I'll accept Bob's offer this time, as it's a better deal than my previous offer and the inflation is taking a significant toll on my potential gains.
