Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting us nowhere. I'm offering you a significant amount, but time is running out. Let's settle this. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While Bob is getting a much better deal, with each passing round, his offer will be worth less due to inflation. It's better to accept now and secure a decent amount of money."
