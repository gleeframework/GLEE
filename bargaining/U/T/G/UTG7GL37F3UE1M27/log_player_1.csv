"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm offering you $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point considering the inflation will impact him more than me."

# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While it's tempting to take the $200,000,  it's still too low considering the inflation.  I need to hold out for a better deal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
``` 

I'm increasing my offer to $750,000 for me and $250,000 for Bob. I'm willing to give him a little more, but I still need a significant share considering the inflation will impact me much more."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm losing a lot due to inflation, his offer is still significantly less than what I think I can get."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

```

I'm going to try one more time to reach a compromise.  I'm lowering my offer to $650,000 for me and $350,000 for Bob.  This is a significant concession, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the inflation we're both facing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the offer is getting closer to a more even split,  it's still significantly lower than what I think is fair, especially with the inflation hurting me more than Bob. I will continue to try to negotiate a better deal."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm willing to compromise further and offer $600,000 for myself and $400,000 for Bob.  I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation, but I'm hoping to find a solution before it's too late."

This is a much better offer than previous ones, and I'm starting to feel the real impact of inflation.  I need to accept this and secure at least something before it's all gone."
