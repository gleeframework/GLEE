Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. Meet me closer to the middle 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to wear me down, but I need to hold my ground. Accepting this offer would mean losing a significant chunk of the money to inflation. I'll hold out for a slightly better deal, knowing that the pressure is on as we approach the halfway point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be real.  We're both losing out here with the inflation eating away at this. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both walk away with something substantial.""} 

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning.  Reaching the halfway point means I'm losing leverage fast. Alice is clearly comfortable dragging this out. Offering a 50/50 split is the cleanest solution.  It emphasizes fairness while also highlighting the very real danger of inflation.  This offer has the best chance of being accepted while still giving me a decent share."
