# Alice gain: 75

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation rate, I propose a division where we keep the same ratio as before (3:1), but slightly adjust the amounts to account for the decreasing value of money. Remember, patience is key here. 
# Bob gain: 38.75 
# Alice gain: 61.25
