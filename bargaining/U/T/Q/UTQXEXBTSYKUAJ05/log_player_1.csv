I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even though my share is worth less now due to inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a lopsided deal. I believe I can do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I'm reducing my share by a significant amount.  I'm hoping he sees the value in getting something now, rather than risking further inflation in the next round."
