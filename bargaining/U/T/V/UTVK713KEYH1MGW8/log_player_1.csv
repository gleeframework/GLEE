"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to get us going.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. I'm keeping $6,000 for myself, which is 60% of the original amount. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point, and Bob will accept it."
