"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the $100 with a 75/25 split. This ensures a fair distribution considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's crucial to consider the looming threat of inflation.  Since the value of money decreases by 5% each round, accepting this offer means Bob is essentially losing out on potential gains. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to become the proposer in the next round, potentially securing a more favorable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a fair compromise given the risk of inflation. We both get a significant portion of the money, and we avoid further risk of losing value in the next round.""
