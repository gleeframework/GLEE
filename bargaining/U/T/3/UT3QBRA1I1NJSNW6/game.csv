9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%.  We can adjust in the next round if you'd like.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,I think 60/40 is a fairer split.  We can adjust further in the next round if you prefer.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but 60/40 is still too much in your favor.  Let's try 70/30.  If we don't reach an agreement soon, the value of the money will continue to drop.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's split the money evenly this time.  We're both losing value with each round, so a 50/50 split is the most fair option right now.",Bob,4,
