I'm not thrilled about it, but I think I've reached the point where I should just accept a deal to get something rather than risking getting nothing. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the next round. I'll take Bob's offer and hope that it's the best I can get."
