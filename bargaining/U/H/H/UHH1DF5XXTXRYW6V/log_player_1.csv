"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $60 for myself and $40 for Bob. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair division, with me taking a bit more. Since there's no inflation in the first round, the money is still worth its full value. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more equal split is fairer. Let's try this. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I'm playing as Alice, I'll consider Bob's offer. Given that the money I gain is now worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to take that into account when evaluating the offer. In the first round, I proposed a 60-40 split in my favor, and now Bob is offering a 45-55 split in his favor.\n\nConsidering the impact of inflation on my potential gain, I'll reject this offer and proceed to the next round. I believe I can negotiate a better deal, and I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to potentially get a more favorable split.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince I rejected Bob's offer in the previous round, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than the original value (10% less in each of the first two rounds).\n\nI'll try to find a balance between getting a decent share and considering the decreasing value of the money. I'll offer a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, along with a message to persuade him to accept this deal.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a reasonable adjustment""}\n\n###\n\nLet's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
