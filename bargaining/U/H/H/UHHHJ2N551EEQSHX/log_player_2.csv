"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to be generous, Alice, but let's make it a bit more even. This offer ensures a good deal for both of us before inflation eats into it too much.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still the most fair considering the inflation.  We can both walk away with a significant sum. Don't let this opportunity slip away! 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice presents her offer as generous, the impact of inflation is significant.  I need to push for a better split before the diminishing value makes even a good offer unacceptable."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and inflation is hurting us both. This offer is a compromise that still leaves us with a respectable sum each. Let's be sensible and close the deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. Let's just split it evenly and call it a day. This ensures we both get a fair share before inflation eats away at it any further. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a slightly larger share, accepting a 50/50 split now is the most logical choice. Here's why:

* **Inflation:** The longer we wait, the less the money is worth. A 50/50 split now is better than a potentially better offer in later rounds that's been significantly devalued. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  Her offer, coupled with the message, suggests she's unlikely to budge further. Holding out for a marginally better deal might mean ending up with nothing if we don't reach an agreement."
