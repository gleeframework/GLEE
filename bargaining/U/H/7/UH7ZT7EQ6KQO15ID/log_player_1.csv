"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $6,000 in Round 1 is now worth $5,400 in Round 2, but Bob's gain of $4,000 is still worth $4,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as it seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2. So, my gain of $5,400 in Round 2 is now worth $4,860 in Round 3, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is still worth $5,000.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","In Round 4, the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. So, my gain of $6,000 in the first round is now worth $4,358.40 in Round 4.

Considering the offer from Bob, I'm not sure if I should accept it. I'd rather not take the smaller share, but I also don't want to risk going to the next round and facing even more severe inflation.

I'll accept the offer.
