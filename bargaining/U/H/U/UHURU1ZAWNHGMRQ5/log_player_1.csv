"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further if needed.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly.  Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","A simple and straightforward proposal from Bob!

I'll accept his offer, as it's a 50-50 split, which is indeed fair.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
