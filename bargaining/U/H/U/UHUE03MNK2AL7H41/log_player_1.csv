"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say, Bob?""
}
```

I'm offering to take $600,000 and leaving $400,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but it's still a fair offer. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the $300,000 I would gain is now worth $285,000, and the $700,000 Bob would gain is still worth $700,000.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I think I'll take it for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
