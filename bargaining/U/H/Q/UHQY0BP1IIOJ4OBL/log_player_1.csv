I'm starting with a very greedy offer!  I figure Bob might accept it, but if he doesn't, I'll get to make the next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 999999 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This is a classic ultimatum game scenario. I'm going to reject this offer. While it's a lot less appealing to me due to inflation, I'm still in a position to make a counter-offer in the next round. I believe I can leverage the fact that Bob's potential gains are also shrinking with inflation, and that he wants to end the game sooner rather than later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, but still keeping the vast majority of the money for myself.  Bob is likely getting frustrated by now, but I'm hoping he'll see that accepting this offer is better than risking further inflation and potentially ending up with nothing."
