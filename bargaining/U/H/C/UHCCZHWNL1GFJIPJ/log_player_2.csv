Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value, I'm not. Time to get real. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is a tough spot, but I'm still holding out. Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation situation, but accepting a 40/60 split sets a bad precedent. There's a chance she panics as the rounds progress and offers a better deal."

{""bob_gain"": 45, ""alice_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""Last offer. Take it or leave it - we both lose if this goes on.""}
