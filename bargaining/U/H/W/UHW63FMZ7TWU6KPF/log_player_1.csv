"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 20% less, I'm not as happy with this offer as I was with my original 50/50 split. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll try to get a better deal. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 40% less for Bob (20% less from round 1 and another 20% from round 2), I'll try to take advantage of that.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to take a bit more for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain being worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. However, since I was rejected in the previous round with a 55/45 split, and this offer is a 50/50 split, I'll consider it a slight improvement.
