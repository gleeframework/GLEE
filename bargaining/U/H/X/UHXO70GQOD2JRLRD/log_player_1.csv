"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving Bob 40% of the original $10,000, which is $4,000. I'll keep the remaining $6,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it, I'm not getting any younger! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 50-50 split is the best deal, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to negotiate further and aim for a better split for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You're getting older, but I'm still willing to give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, giving Bob 45% of the original $10,000, which is $4,500, but adjusted for the inflation, it's worth less for him. I'll keep the remaining $5,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're not getting any younger either, time to make a decision! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

After considering Bob's offer, I'll make a decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as the money I'll get ($4,000) is still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even lower values. Plus, Bob's offer seems to be a decent compromise, and I'm willing to take it."
