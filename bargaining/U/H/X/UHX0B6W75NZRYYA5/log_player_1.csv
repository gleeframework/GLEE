"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one...

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, and the money Bob gains is still worth the same as in the previous round, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $4,200 and Bob gets $5,800."
