Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option. Let's not drag this out.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, time is running out and the value is decreasing. This offer is a compromise to get us both a reasonable amount. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still in my best interest to hold out a little longer. The inflation is hurting him significantly more than me. I believe I can secure a better deal in the next round or two."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 6200,
""bob_gain"": 3800,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a good deal for both of us considering the time pressure and the shrinking pot. Let's settle this now.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm slightly lowering my demand to make the offer more appealing to Bob, but I'm still aiming for a significantly larger share.  The inflation is steadily eroding his potential gains, making it more likely he'll concede."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but this needs to be a mutually beneficial agreement. This is a fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This offer is getting very close to my previous proposal.  While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more, the risk is starting to outweigh the potential reward. Bob's share is eroding quickly, and he might be less willing to negotiate further. It's better to secure a win now than risk getting nothing in the later rounds."
