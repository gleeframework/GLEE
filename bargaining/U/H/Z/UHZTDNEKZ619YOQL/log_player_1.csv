"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4000 dollars, which is a relatively small portion, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair split, let's end this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can do better than a 50-50 split, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but still a good one!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 4500 dollars, which is a bit more than my previous offer, but still a reasonable compromise considering the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, let's make a deal! 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to be careful with my decision.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of 4800 dollars. It's a relatively good deal considering the reduced value of the money, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round and potentially getting a worse deal."
