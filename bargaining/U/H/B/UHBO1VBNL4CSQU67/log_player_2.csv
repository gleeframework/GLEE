Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time. This is a serious offer, slightly better for you than last round considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even with inflation, accepting Alice's offer now would mean settling for significantly less than what I believe is a fair share. The longer this drags on, the more leverage I lose due to the higher inflation rate I face. However, I need to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate and not let this go to zero. I'll propose a counter offer in the next round that leans more towards a compromise."
