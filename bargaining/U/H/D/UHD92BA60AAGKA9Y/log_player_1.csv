Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial amount, and Bob gets 40%."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider the offer. Since the money is worth 0% less for me, but 5% less for Bob, I'll need to think about whether this offer is better for me than the next round.

I'll reject the offer.
