"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering you $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're just starting out and we have 11 more rounds to go!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my previous offer would have been even less appealing to Bob, so I'm not surprised he rejected it.

As for Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting $300,000, which is a significant amount, but it's still less than half of the original $1,000,000.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.

  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering you $450,000 and keeping $550,000 for myself. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still a relatively fair offer considering the decreasing value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns with the same offer as Round 2, but with the money being worth even less due to inflation.

I'll have to think carefully about this one. If I accept this offer, I'll be getting $450,000, which is a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round.
