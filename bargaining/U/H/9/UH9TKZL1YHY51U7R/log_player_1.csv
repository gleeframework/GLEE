"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you a generous 10% if you accept.""
}
```

This offer gives me 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 10%. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already biting!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to weigh the pros and cons.

In this round, I'd gain $200,000, which is worth 80% of the original $250,000 I would have gotten in the first round (20% less due to inflation). Not a great deal, but I might as well consider it.

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think 70% is a fair share. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a better deal for myself, considering the inflation is still eating away at the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on me now!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money I gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

In this round, I'd gain $400,000, which is worth 40% of the original $1,000,000 I would have gotten in the first round (48.8% less due to inflation). It's a relatively better deal than the previous round, but I'm still not thrilled about it.

I'll decide to reject this offer and make a counter-proposal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. It's only fair, considering the inflation is eating away at the value.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more reasonable and propose a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finally divide the money."
