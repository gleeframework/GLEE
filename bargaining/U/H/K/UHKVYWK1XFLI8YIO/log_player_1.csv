I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob's offer is worse for me than my original proposal, even considering inflation.  I'm going to reject it and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor.  This is still a better deal for me than Bob's last offer, and it takes into account the inflation we've experienced."
