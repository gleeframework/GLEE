"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can end the game quickly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000 and keeping $8,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in ending the game early and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Accept this fair split and we can move on. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious with my proposal. Since Bob is offering a 50/50 split, I think it's a reasonable proposal. I'll accept it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
