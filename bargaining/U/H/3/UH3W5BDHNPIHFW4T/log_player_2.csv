"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I get the majority, but you get a decent share.  We can negotiate further if you don't like this. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While 100,000 is a decent amount, it's important to consider the potential for a better deal in the future. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make a proposal in the next round and potentially secure a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""message"": ""I'm willing to be fair, but I think we should split the money more evenly. This proposal gives you a good share, and it's a fair starting point for negotiation.""
