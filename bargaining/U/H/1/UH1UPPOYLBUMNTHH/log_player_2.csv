Alice's offer:

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The inflation is hurting me, but a 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take this offer, or we both risk losing out more. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000
