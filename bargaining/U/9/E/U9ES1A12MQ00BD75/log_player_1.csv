"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 
I'll start by offering a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, and it leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to fight for more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While I appreciate Bob's sense of humor, I'm not willing to accept a 10/90 split. I'm hoping we can find a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 
I'm offering a 55/45 split this time.  I think this is a fair compromise, as it's closer to an even split than the previous offers."
