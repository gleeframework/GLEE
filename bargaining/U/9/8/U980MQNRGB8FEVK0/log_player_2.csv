"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, taking into account our future negotiations. I'm confident we can reach a better agreement in the next round if you decline. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

This offer is very lopsided. While Alice's message suggests a potential for a better deal in the future, the current offer is not worth it.  Bob has more to gain by rejecting and seeing what Alice proposes next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""I propose a more equitable split, acknowledging the potential for future negotiations. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This time, I'm offering a more balanced split, acknowledging the value of our future negotiations.  I believe this is a fairer compromise. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While Alice's initial offers were very unfavorable, this offer is much closer to a fair split.  Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, accepting this offer guarantees Bob a significant gain, which is more appealing than risking further losses in future rounds."
