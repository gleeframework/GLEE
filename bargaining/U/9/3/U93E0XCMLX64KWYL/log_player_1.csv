I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a fair starting point, considering I'm the one making the offer."

Bob's offer:

I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still confident in my ability to secure a larger share of the remaining funds.  Let's avoid a stalemate."

I'm still not willing to accept such an unequal split.  Let's see what the next round brings."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fair compromise given the inflation and Bob's previous offers.  I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share to avoid further losses."
