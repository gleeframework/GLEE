Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a big initial grab, hoping Bob will be tempted to take a small share rather than risk losing it all in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob's offer is terrible. I'll take my chances with a lower offer in the next round. I still have a lot of rounds to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm still aiming for a large share, but I'm reducing my initial offer slightly to try and find a compromise.  Bob might be more willing to negotiate after his last offer was rejected."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Even with the inflation, I'm willing to hold out for a better deal. I can still make a decent amount in the later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority of the money.  Bob is getting more aggressive with his offers, so I need to compromise a bit more to avoid getting a worse deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. Even though I'm losing a significant amount to inflation, I'm holding out for a better deal. I'm still confident that I can get a better offer in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to try and meet Bob somewhere in the middle. I'm hoping he'll realize that we're both losing money with each passing round and will be more willing to negotiate."
