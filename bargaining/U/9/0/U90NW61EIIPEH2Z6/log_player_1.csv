"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, the fact that Bob is proposing a 40-60 split, which is the opposite of my initial offer, makes me think he might be trying to take advantage of the inflation.

I'll reject this offer:
```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a more conservative offer this time. Here's my proposal:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```
I'm offering a slightly more favorable split to Bob this time, hoping he'll accept and we can end the game."
