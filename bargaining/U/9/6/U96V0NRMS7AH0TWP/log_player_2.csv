Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor.  While it's tempting to accept something rather than risk getting nothing, holding out a bit longer might make her more reasonable. There's still a chance to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""Look, I want to be fair, but the clock is ticking and inflation is hurting you more. Take this deal and we both win.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is indeed hurting me more, so I'll take a bigger share to compensate 
# Bob gain: 38 
# Alice gain: 62 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using the inflation as a justification for an even more lopsided deal! This is a clear sign she's trying to exploit the situation.  While the pressure is on, accepting this offer would mean losing significantly more to her advantage. It's a gamble, but holding out might make her realize I'm not budging easily."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the only fair option. Accept it now, or we both lose out.""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time pressure:**  We're running out of rounds, and the longer this drags on, the less money we both get.  
* **Diminishing returns:** Even if I try to squeeze a bit more out of her, the inflation means the potential gain is getting smaller with each round. 
* **Firm stance:** Offering 50/50 again shows I'm serious about a fair deal and unwilling to be taken advantage of. This might push Alice to accept rather than risk getting nothing."
