"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it's tempting to accept a ""fair"" offer,  Bob should remember that the money loses value faster for him.  By rejecting, Bob gets to propose in the next round and can potentially secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I propose a slightly more favorable split for me, as the money decreases in value more quickly for me. Let's make a deal!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, this is a more reasonable split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is a bit closer to what Bob might have been hoping for, remember that the money loses value more quickly for him.  He needs to secure a bigger chunk to make up for this.  By rejecting, Bob gets to propose again in the next round and can potentially push for a more favorable split."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, especially for me.  Let's agree to a deal that's more advantageous for both of us, given the current circumstances.""

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's find a middle ground to minimize our losses from inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still losing out on a significant amount of money due to the rapid devaluation for him. While Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous offer, it's not enough to make up for the losses.  Bob needs to try and secure a bigger chunk of the remaining money to make the deal worthwhile."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6500,
""alice_gain"": 3500,
""message"": ""The value of the money is decreasing very quickly for me.  I need to make a better deal to avoid further losses. Let's find a solution that benefits us both, considering the current inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're running out of time, let's compromise to save what's left. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While time is running out,  the offer still doesn't account for the drastic devaluation of money for Bob. He needs a more favorable split to make it worthwhile. It's crucial for Bob to push for a more advantageous deal, even if it risks getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 7000,
""alice_gain"": 3000,
""message"": ""We're getting close to the end.  I'm offering you a smaller share, but it's still more than what you'll get if we reach the end of the rounds with no agreement.  Let's be realistic and save what we can.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 33.66% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: We're almost out of time, this is my final compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though the game is almost over, Bob still needs to try and secure a better deal. This offer is still not accounting for the significant loss in value for his share. He needs to be more assertive and try to get closer to his desired amount to make the deal worthwhile. There's still a chance to negotiate in the next round."

Round 10
