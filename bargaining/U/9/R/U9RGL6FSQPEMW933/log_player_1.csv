Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm offering to take $90 and leave Bob with $10.  It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping to secure a large share early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers.  The inflation means my potential gains are shrinking with each round.  It's better to take the $60 now than risk getting a worse deal later."
