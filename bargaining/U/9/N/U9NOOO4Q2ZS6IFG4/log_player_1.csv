I'm going to be a little greedy in the first round! I'll take $900,000 and leave Bob with $100,000.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While it's not the most ideal situation, it's better than losing the entire amount due to inflation."
