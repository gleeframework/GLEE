"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60-40 is more fair, considering we're both taking a risk by rejecting the first offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see that Bob is trying to turn the tables on me.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me in the second round, and Bob's offer is actually worse for me than my original offer, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to make a new proposal that takes into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 20% less for me, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still thinking 55-45 is fair""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 55% of the remaining $10,000, which is $5,500, and keeping $4,500 for myself. I'm hoping this offer is more appealing to Bob!"
