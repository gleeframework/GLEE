"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, we can discuss further if needed""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a more fair split, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's end this quickly and both get a good amount. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","I think Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him, but I'm willing to accept it to end the game quickly and get a decent amount. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
