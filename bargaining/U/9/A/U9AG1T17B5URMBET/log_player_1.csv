"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure Bob might accept this, as he's getting something, and it's better than getting nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this is a significant amount of money, I'm not going to accept such a dramatic change in the split. The inflation is hitting me harder, and I'm betting that Bob will eventually be more willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split in my favor. While Bob's offer in the previous round was tempting, I'm still hoping for a more balanced outcome. The inflation is starting to bite, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting offers, I'll end up with nothing in the later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is starting to feel like a reasonable compromise, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I know the inflation is hitting me hard, but I'm confident I can get a higher share than 20%.  I'm going to keep pushing for a more balanced split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm offering a 70/30 split in my favor. The inflation is making each round more risky, and I'm worried about getting nothing at all. This offer is a compromise from my previous proposals, but I still hope to secure a significant portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am still not satisfied with the split. Even though inflation is hitting me hard, I am determined to try and secure a more balanced share. I believe Bob will be forced to compromise at some point, and I will be in a better position to negotiate in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm aware inflation is severely impacting my share, but I'm hopeful this offer might be more appealing to Bob than the previous ones.  I need to find a balance between securing something and pushing for a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation is taking a huge toll. This is the best I'm likely to get, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. I accept the offer."
