"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $10,000 and Bob gets 20%. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a smaller share this round. Be careful! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful now!

Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly. My gain of $4000 in this round is equivalent to $4000 / 0.95 = $4211.58 in the first round.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as I'm giving up more than I would have in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 5% less than in Round 2, so I'll have to be careful with my offer.

I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split, but still hoping to get a better deal than Bob's previous offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm not afraid of the inflation. Your turn!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a smaller share this round. I'm not afraid of inflation either! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is biting hard!

Since the money is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, my gain of $4500 in this round is equivalent to $4500 / 0.8587 = $5225.83 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to get a bit desperate. I'll have to consider the diminishing returns due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer, but I'll have to be more careful with my next proposal.

# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, inflation is really taking a toll!

Since the money is worth 22.62% less than in the first round, my gain of $3500 in this round is equivalent to $3500 / 0.7778 = $4500.39 in the first round.

I'm getting desperate, but I'll have to think carefully about this offer. I'm not sure if I want to give up even more of the remaining money.

I'll reject this offer, but I'll have to come up with an even more aggressive proposal to try to get a better deal.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 7, the money is worth 25.88% less than in the first round. I'll have to be extremely careful with my offer.

# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm getting desperate indeed!

Since the money is worth 30.17% less than in the first round, my gain of $2500 in this round is equivalent to $2500 / 0.6971 = $3587.19 in the first round.

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm starting to run out of options. I'll have to accept this offer and hope that Bob will be reasonable in future rounds.
