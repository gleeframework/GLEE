Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was too greedy.  Let's be realistic - the value is dropping fast for you. I'll take 70/30. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still holding out for a better deal.  The value is dropping faster for me, but I'm confident I can get a more even split if we keep negotiating."
