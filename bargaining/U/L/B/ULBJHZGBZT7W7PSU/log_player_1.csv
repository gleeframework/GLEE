"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, suggesting a fair and reasonable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $6,000 is now worth $5,400. Considering Bob's offer, I'm now looking at $3,000, which is worth $2,700 in today's money.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems Bob is getting a larger share than before, and the value of my share has decreased due to inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my previous $6,000 is now worth $5,400, and the total value of the money is decreasing by 10% each round. I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Compromise on a smaller share for me, but I think this is a fair split""
}
```

I'm offering to take $4,500, which is worth $4,050 in today's money, and leaving $5,500 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the value of the money in today's terms:

Initial $10,000 is now worth 0.7 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 * 0.9 = 0.4786 (or 47.86%) of its original value.

My previous $6,000 is now worth 0.4786 * 6000 = $2,861.60

Bob's offer is for me to take $2,000, which is worth 0.4786 * 2000 = $1,757.20 in today's money.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer, as it seems Bob is getting a larger share than before, and the value of my share has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the current value of the money.

My previous $6,000 is now worth $2,861.60, and the total value of the money is decreasing by 10% each round. I'll offer a smaller share to account for the inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2200,
  ""bob_gain"": 7800,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I think this is a fair split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to take $2,200, which is worth $1,047.35 in today's money, and leaving $7,800 for Bob."
