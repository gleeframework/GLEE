Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than that.  I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I'm also going to take some of the pressure off by offering a bit more for myself.  Let's be fair and work towards a win-win. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
