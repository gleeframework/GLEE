{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I think it's too one-sided. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to give up 80% of the money. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate a better deal."

# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer again!

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm still not comfortable with giving up 70% of the money. I think I'm getting closer to a reasonable compromise, but I need to hold out for a better deal. I'll wait for Bob's next offer and try to negotiate further.

Also, I'm starting to worry about the impact of inflation on my share of the money..."
