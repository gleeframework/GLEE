"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can wrap up the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000, which is a 80-20 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 20/80 split.  Let's try a more even split.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

I'll have to decide whether to accept Bob's offer of $4,500 for me and $5,500 for Bob.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll make a new offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. Consider this offer!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $5,200 and Bob gets $4,800, which is a 52-48 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move forward."
