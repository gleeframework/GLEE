Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, take it or leave it! ðŸ˜‰

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's better to see what Alice is willing to offer in the next round. By rejecting, I can make a proposal in the next round and potentially get a better share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
