"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This offer gives me $900,000 and Bob $100,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since Bob's offer is worth 10% less than the original amount, I'll consider the effective amounts:

Alice gain: 200,000 (worth $200,000 in original value)
Bob gain: 800,000 (worth $800,000 in original value)

I'll accept this offer.
