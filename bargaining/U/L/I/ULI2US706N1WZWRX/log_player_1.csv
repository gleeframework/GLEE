"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
``` 

This is a fair starting offer, but I'm aware of the inflation and will adjust my offers accordingly in later rounds.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse than my initial offer, even with the inflation. I'm willing to take a smaller share, but I won't accept a deal that gives him a larger share.  Let's see if I can make a better counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
```

I'm willing to lower my share slightly to try and reach an agreement. This offer still ensures that I get a bigger share despite the inflation, and it's closer to Bob's previous offer.  Let's see if this is acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable.  Even with the inflation, I'm not willing to accept such a small share.  I need to keep fighting for a fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but this time, I'm taking into account the inflation. I'm willing to accept a smaller share than my previous offer because the inflation is impacting me more than Bob. This offer is close to Bob's last offer, and I hope he'll see it as a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3500, ""bob_gain"": 6500}
```

I'm lowering my share again to try and reach a compromise.  This offer accounts for the inflation and is still more than Bob's previous offer. It's a risky move, but it's the best chance I have to avoid getting nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly unreasonable. I need to keep trying to reach a compromise.  I'm still willing to lower my share, but not to this extent."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 3000, ""bob_gain"": 7000}
```

I'm lowering my share again, but I'm still holding out for a fairer split. This offer reflects the inflation and brings me closer to Bob's previous offer.  Time is running out, so I need to take a risk and see if this is enough to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 36.98% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1500 
# Bob gain: 8500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unacceptable. Even with the inflation, I refuse to take such a tiny share. I'm running out of time, but I'm determined to keep fighting for a fairer deal. I need to come up with a more aggressive strategy to convince Bob to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 2500, ""bob_gain"": 7500}
```

This is a risky move, but I need to take a stand. Bob's offers are getting increasingly unfair, and I'm running out of time.  I'm lowering my share again, but I'm making it clear that I won't accept anything less.  I need to show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 43.12% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is completely unfair and takes advantage of the inflation. I will not accept such a small share, even with the time constraints.  I'd rather walk away with nothing than be taken advantage of. It was a pleasure playing with you, Bob."
