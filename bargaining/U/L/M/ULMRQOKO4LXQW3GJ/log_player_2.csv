"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 50/50 to start with. Fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair on the surface, I know there's inflation to consider. I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a slight advantage because of the inflation. Let's see if you accept this deal, or we can continue negotiating.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to keep some buffer against inflation. Let's see if you're willing to meet me in the middle. 
# Bob gain: 550000 
# Alice gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I still want to get more, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and it's not a terrible deal considering the dwindling value of the money."
