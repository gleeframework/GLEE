"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of 5000 is worth 90% of the original amount, which is 4500, and Bob's gain of 5000 is worth 80% of the original amount, which is 4000.

Since this offer is less favorable to me than my initial offer, I'll reject it. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my goal is to maximize my share while minimizing the risk of Bob rejecting my offer. Here's my next offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}"
