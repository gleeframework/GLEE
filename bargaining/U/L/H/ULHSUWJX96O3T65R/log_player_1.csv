I propose to keep $9,000 and give Bob $1,000.  I'm hoping to get a good deal in the first round, but I'm willing to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $6,000 for me and $4,000 for Bob.  I'm hoping this is a more reasonable compromise considering Bob's previous offer and the inflation."
