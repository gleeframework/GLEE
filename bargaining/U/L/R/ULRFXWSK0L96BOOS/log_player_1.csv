"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point, and it's a good compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment to balance the scales! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's revised offer. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and 30% for me is a bit too low. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split it 50-50!""}

I'm proposing a more equal split this time, with each of us getting 50% of the initial $100. I think this is a fair compromise, considering we're both willing to negotiate."
