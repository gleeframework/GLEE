"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I want to maximize my share in the first round. 
* I'm assuming Bob is rational and will take a small share now rather than risk getting nothing in a later round when inflation kicks in. 
* I'm leaving a small portion for Bob to incentivize him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:** My share is now worth 10% less than it was in the previous round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I reject this offer, I risk getting nothing in the next round. The inflation will continue to erode my potential gains.
* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial proposal, it's still a substantial amount of money considering the inflation factor. Accepting this offer guarantees me a sizable share."
