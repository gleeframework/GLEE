I'll start with a generous offer, giving Bob a small share but ensuring I get the majority. I figure this will increase the chances of him accepting in the first round."

# Alice gain: 800000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not satisfied with that offer.  While it's a significant increase from the first round, I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself."

Round 3

# Alice gain: 700000

Do you accept this offer?","```json

While Bob's offer is increasing, the impact of inflation on his share is significant. I'm still confident I can get a better deal, especially considering how much the money is losing value for Bob. I'll continue to negotiate."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}

I'm trying to find a middle ground. This offer gives Bob a larger share, but it still allows me to secure a substantial portion.  It's time to see if he's willing to compromise."

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to being equal, but it's still not enough. With the amount of inflation he's dealing with, I'm sure he'll be more willing to accept a slightly less favorable deal in the next few rounds. I'll stick to my plan of slowly increasing my offer and see if we can reach an agreement."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

This time, I'm offering Bob a larger share,  but still keeping the majority for myself. We're approaching the halfway point, and I want to ensure we reach an agreement before the inflation really starts to bite."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to an even split, his share is significantly devalued due to inflation. I believe I can still secure a more favorable deal for myself, especially considering the time pressure."

Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to slightly increase my offer again.  Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, and I think this offer might be enough to convince him to accept. It's a good compromise for both of us."

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000

This is a good deal for me considering the inflation that is severely impacting Bob's share.  Even though it's an even split, the value of his half is significantly less than mine.  It's time to take the deal and avoid the risk of getting nothing!"
