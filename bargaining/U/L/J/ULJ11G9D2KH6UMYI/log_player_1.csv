"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, giving Bob a 10% share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The tables have turned!

I'll reject this offer from Bob. The money I gain is now worth significantly less due to inflation, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll aim for a more balanced offer this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm hoping he'll accept it and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The rejection continues!

Considering the inflation effect, which has now reduced my potential gain by 14.26% from the original amount, I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still relatively close to my initial offer from round 1, and I'd like to avoid further negotiations.

I'll accept this offer from Bob.
