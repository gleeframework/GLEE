Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a small amount, hoping he'll accept it quickly.  After all, I know he's probably going to try and take most of the money for himself in the next round.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being very aggressive.  He's obviously trying to take advantage of the inflation. While 300,000 is better than nothing, I'm going to hold out and try to get a better deal. There's still time to negotiate, and I think I can get a bigger piece of the pie."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly.  I'm not sure if Bob is truly aware of the inflation or if he's just trying to be a jerk.  I think offering a slightly bigger share to him might make him think he's getting a good deal and be more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is getting more and more greedy.  He's clearly taking advantage of the inflation.  I'm still going to reject his offer. I'm not sure if he's aware of how much less his offer is worth to him now, but I'm confident I can get a better deal if I hold out. There are still a lot of rounds left."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going to try a 50/50 split.  With inflation, the money is worth significantly less for both of us now.  This is a fair deal, and I think Bob might be willing to accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation.  His offer is becoming incredibly lopsided.  I'm not going to let him bully me into accepting this.  I'll keep fighting for a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly smaller share than last time, but it's still more than his last offer. The inflation is really starting to bite, but I think Bob might be starting to get nervous.  I'm hoping this will make him think about the value of the money he's losing and be willing to settle for something closer to a 60/40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being incredibly unreasonable!  His offer is getting worse and worse. I'm not going to give in to his greed. There are still a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I hold out."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a larger share than before to see if I can get a deal done.  With only a few rounds left, the inflation is really hitting hard, and I need to secure something. I'm hoping that by offering him a bigger share, I can get him to accept and avoid the risk of ending up with nothing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 61.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 86.58% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10000 
# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being completely unreasonable. His offer is insulting, and I refuse to accept it. I'm still hoping that I can get a better deal, even with the remaining rounds being heavily affected by inflation. I'm not going to let him take everything."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to get a deal done before the final round. The inflation is severely impacting the value of the money now, so I need to secure something.  I'm hoping this offer will be enough to persuade Bob.  It's a big risk, but I have to try."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 68.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 91.41% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is absurdly unfair.  Even though the inflation is punishingly high, I'm not going to let him take nearly everything.  We're both going to end up with nothing if I accept.  I'm done playing this game."
