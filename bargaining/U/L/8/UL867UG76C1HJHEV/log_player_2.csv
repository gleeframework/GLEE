"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a very unfair offer. Even with the inflation, I can do much better than 50,000. Let's see what Alice offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 800000,
""alice_gain"": 200000,
""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you 20% of the money, but I need a significant share to make this worthwhile for me."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The longer this goes on, the less valuable the money becomes for you, Bob. I'm offering you a fair deal - take it while it's still good. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This is still not a good offer. I'm willing to take a smaller share for a bit longer, hoping that Alice will realize she needs to offer me more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a larger share than 200,000. Let's meet in the middle with a 70/30 split. This will give us both a decent amount before the value of the money drops further.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a larger share, but time is working against you.  My offer is more than fair considering the inflation. Let's close this deal and both benefit. 
# Bob gain: 250000 
# Alice gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still not enough for me. I'm confident that I can get a better deal by holding out a few more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, the value of the money keeps decreasing for me. It's time to make a reasonable compromise. Let's split it 60/40. This way, we both get a considerable amount, and we can finally end this game.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. The clock is ticking, and your share is rapidly shrinking.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not accepting this offer. Although the money is decreasing in value, I'm still confident I can get a better deal. I'm willing to hold out for another few rounds to see if Alice will budge."

""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
