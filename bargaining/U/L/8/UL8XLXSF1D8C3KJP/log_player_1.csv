Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%."

# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think 30 is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30% gain for myself, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
