"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Take it or leave it! Don't be greedy!""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000, which seems like a fair starting point. The message is a gentle nudge to get the game started!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll consider Bob's offer carefully.

Since Bob's offer is to meet me halfway, I'll accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
