I'm going for a pretty aggressive first offer, aiming for 90% of the money. I figure Bob might accept this, as it's still a decent amount, and he might not know about the inflation yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'm not happy about getting only $1000, it's better than nothing. The inflation has already made the money worth less, and if I reject, I risk getting even less in the next round.  It's time to cut my losses and move on."
