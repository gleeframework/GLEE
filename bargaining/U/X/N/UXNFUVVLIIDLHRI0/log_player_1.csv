"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $1,000,000, which is $400,000. I'm keeping the remaining 60% for myself, $600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $600,000 from the previous round is now worth $570,000 (95% of $600,000).

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a fair split, and I'm willing to accept it.
