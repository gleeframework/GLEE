I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not comfortable with Bob getting a 2:1 split, especially considering the money I gain is worth 20% less due to inflation. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
