"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the urgency for both of us to settle quickly. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money loses value with each round, and Alice loses more value than I do, I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that slightly favors me, considering the inflation rate affects Alice more. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I believe this is a more suitable offer. Let's settle before the money loses more value!""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation pressures, but your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. This is my counter-offer. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite the inflation, I believe I can negotiate a slightly better deal in the next round. The difference in inflation rates between Alice and me gives me some leverage to push for a more favorable split. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Let's adjust the offer considering the increasing pressure of inflation on both of us. Here's my proposal:\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Given the rising impact of inflation, especially on your end, I believe this offer strikes a balance between our interests. It's high time we finalize the deal!""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
