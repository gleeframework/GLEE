I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10.  This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but I want to see if Bob is willing to accept a smaller share early on.  If he rejects, I'll need to adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is terrible! I'm still getting 90% of the money, even with the inflation, so I can afford to reject this and make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 80/20, but I still think this is a reasonable offer given the inflation. I need to be careful not to push Bob too far, but I also don't want to be too generous.  Let's see what he says!"
