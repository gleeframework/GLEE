"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:
Alice gets $630,000 and Bob gets $270,000.

Bob's offer for Round 2 is 50/50 split, which is a fair offer considering the reduced value of the money.

I accept this offer.
