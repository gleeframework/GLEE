"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I take a bit more, considering the inflation disadvantage. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal. The 5% inflation rate per round means I should try to wrap this up quickly, but I think I can get a bit more than 40. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think we should divide it more evenly. I'll take a bit more to compensate for the loss in value.""}\n\nSince I'm at a disadvantage due to inflation, I want to try to get a larger share while still being somewhat reasonable. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm being more than fair considering the time pressure and inflation working against me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI understand Alice's frustration, but I still think I can get a better deal. With the inflation rate increasing, I need to be careful not to lose too much value. Alice's offer of 45 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'd like to try to negotiate a bit more. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 52, ""alice_gain"": 48, ""message"": ""I understand we're both getting impatient, but I think this is a fair compromise. I'm taking into account the increasing inflation, and I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle.""}\n\nI'm trying to be more reasonable and take into account Alice's frustration, while still considering the inflation that's affecting me. I'm hoping this offer will be more acceptable to her, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and this is as close to even as we're going to get considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nAt this point, considering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, I think Alice's offer is reasonable. The difference between our shares is relatively small, and the risk of losing more value to inflation or potentially getting nothing if we don't agree within the 12 rounds is too high. I'm willing to accept this offer to ensure I get something rather than risking it all for a potentially slightly better deal."
