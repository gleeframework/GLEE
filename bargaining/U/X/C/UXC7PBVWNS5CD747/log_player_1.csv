"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and equal. Your turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll think carefully about Bob's offer... Hmm, I'd rather not give him a bigger share, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept this offer.
