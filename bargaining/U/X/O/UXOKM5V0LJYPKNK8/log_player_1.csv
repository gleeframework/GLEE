Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it fairly, considering the depreciation for you

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""The rate of inflation makes this tough, Bob. I'm being flexible, but this is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me (Alice) due to inflation.  I need to secure a deal quickly.
* **Bob's Position:** Bob's offer in round 2 suggests he's aiming for a slight advantage, likely aware of the inflation working in his favor.
* **Finality:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm increasing the pressure on Bob to accept. He risks getting a worse deal in later rounds if I become more desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the increasing depreciation for you, this is a fair adjustment 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Desperation Point:** The inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. While not ideal, getting $4,000 is significantly better than risking even lower offers from Bob as the game continues. 
* **Bob's Strategy:** Bob is clearly playing a waiting game, knowing the inflation works in his favor. It's unlikely he'll offer anything better than this. 
* **Minimizing Losses:**  Accepting now cuts my losses. Waiting any longer will likely result in accepting an even worse offer out of desperation."
