"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's share fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $4000, which is 40% of the total amount, and I'll take $6000, which is 60%. I've included a message saying ""Let's share fairly!"" to convey that I think this is a reasonable and equitable split.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm feeling generous, but let's make it snappy. Time is money. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, the $4000 offered by Bob is actually worth $3200 to me. Considering this, I don't think Bob's offer is generous enough, especially since he's taking the larger share.\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nYour turn!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle!""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the inflation and the fact that Bob didn't accept my previous offer. This time, I'm offering Bob $4200 and taking $5800 for myself. I've included a message saying ""Let's meet in the middle!"" to convey that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution.\n\nYour turn! What does Bob say?"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Take it or leave it - we're both losing out the longer this drags on. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation, the $4500 offered by Bob is actually worth approximately $2300 to me. Given that this is Bob's final offer and the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, I think it's in my best interest to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds.\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nI'll take the offer and end the game here."
