"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and divide it 60-40, I'm the one who initiated the game after all! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 525000, ""alice_gain"": 475000, ""message"": ""I understand you initiated the game, but I'm sure we can find a more equitable split. How about this?""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Exploiting Inflation:** Alice's offer heavily favors her, and the inflation dynamic means the longer the game goes on, the worse it gets for her. By offering a counter-proposal, I'm putting pressure on her to settle sooner rather than later. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** I'm not being overly greedy in my counter-offer. A slight majority split in my favor acknowledges the time value of money in this scenario while still leaving a decent amount for Alice. This makes it more likely she'll consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message is important. I'm not shutting down further discussion but rather framing it as finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see you're a tough negotiator, but I still think I deserve a bit more. How about we meet in the middle? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting to feel the pressure of inflation, evidenced by her move towards a more ""middle-ground"" offer. However, time is still working against her more than me. While her offer is better than her initial 60-40 split, it's still not favorable enough for me to accept.  I need to push for a more significant shift in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 560000, ""alice_gain"": 440000, ""message"": ""Time is money Alice, and it's depreciating quickly.  This is my final offer.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying Pressure:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling I'm unwilling to negotiate further. 
* **Strategic Concession:** I've increased my initial offer slightly, acknowledging her previous move towards a 50-50 split. This might make my offer more palatable, even though it's still strongly in my favor.
* **Leveraging Inflation:** Each round that passes erodes her potential gains more than mine. I'm betting that the prospect of losing another 10% will be enough to push her towards accepting my offer."
