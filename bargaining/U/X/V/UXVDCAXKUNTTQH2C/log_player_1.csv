"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, leaving Bob with a small portion but acknowledging his role in the game.  I'm curious to see if he'll accept this or try to negotiate for a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred my initial proposal, a 50/50 split is still a very favorable outcome for me. Considering the inflation factor, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a significant portion of the money."
