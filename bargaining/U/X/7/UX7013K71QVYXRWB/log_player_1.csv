"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob is greedy or reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like to get more, the 20% loss of value is too much to risk. I'll accept the offer and move on."
