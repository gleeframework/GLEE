"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can split the money!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","In the second round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $360,000 in real value.

Bob's offer is the same as his previous one, but now it's worth 20% less for him. So, his gain of $600,000 is actually worth $480,000 in real value.

Considering the inflation, I think this offer is slightly more favorable to me. I'll accept it.
