Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

Round 2

Bob's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With the inflation factor, my gain of $4000 is worth 90% of the original $5000, so it's a bit less appealing. However, Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 95% of the original $5000, which is a better deal for him.

I'll decide to reject this offer.
