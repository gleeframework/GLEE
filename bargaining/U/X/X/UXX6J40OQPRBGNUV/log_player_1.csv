"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the $10,000 and leave 40% for Bob. I'm starting with a fair split, hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it down the middle, it's a fair deal for both of us! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. 

I'll reject the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not sure if splitting it down the middle is the best deal for me, considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less due to inflation, my offer for this round will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly better deal for myself, hoping Bob will be willing to accept."
