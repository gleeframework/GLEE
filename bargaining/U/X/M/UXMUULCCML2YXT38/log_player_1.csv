"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the lion's share of the money, but still gives Bob a small amount. This is a risky move, as Bob may reject it and propose a more even split in the next round. However, I'm hoping that he'll be tempted by even a small amount of money and accept my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is much more equitable than my initial proposal, but it's still not enough to sway me. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can push him to make an even more favorable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, aiming for a 55/45 ratio in my favor. This should be more appealing to Bob than my previous offer, but still leaves me with a substantial share of the money.  I'm hoping that the risk of losing money due to inflation will encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting more lopsided in his favor, but it's still not enough to convince me. I'm still hoping to get a larger share of the money, and I'm confident that I can secure a better deal by rejecting his offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, this time aiming for a 60/40 split.  I'm recognizing that Bob is becoming increasingly aggressive with his proposals, but I still believe I can secure a better deal for myself.  I'm hoping that the threat of further inflation will push him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unfavorable to me, but I'm still not convinced. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal by rejecting his offer and continuing to negotiate.  I'm hoping that the increasing threat of inflation will force him to make a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, this time aiming for a 70/30 split. I'm aware that Bob is getting increasingly desperate, and his offers are becoming more lopsided, but I'm still hoping to secure a larger share of the money. This offer reflects a significant concession on my part, but I believe that it's still fair given the circumstances. I'm hoping that the risk of further inflation will push him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

This is a 50/50 split, which is a far cry from my initial goal but much better than the offers Bob has been making. With each round, the inflation is taking a bigger bite out of the value of the money for Bob, so I think it's time to accept this offer. It's better to get half the money now than risk getting nothing at all in the end."
