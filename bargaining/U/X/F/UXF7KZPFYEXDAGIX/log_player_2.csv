"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split: 90% for me, 10% for you. This way, we both get a decent amount, and we can finish this quickly. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round. Alice's proposed split is far from fair, and I believe I can negotiate a better deal. Since the money doesn't lose value for me with each passing round, I have nothing to lose by proceeding. Let's see how Alice reacts to a different proposal.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know when it's my turn to make an offer. I'll propose a division that I believe is more equitable."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that I believe is more reasonable. Since the money loses value for Alice with each passing round, I'll try to find a middle ground that might be more appealing to her.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""I think a 40-60 split is more fair, considering we both want to maximize our gains.

I'm open to further negotiations if needed."
