"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This is a 60-40 split in my favor. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid the risk of inflation eating into our potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

After considering Bob's offer, I decide to reject it. I think I can do better than a 45-55 split. I'll wait for the next round and try to negotiate a better deal. 

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Inflation is eating away at our potential earnings, so I need to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

I'm pushing for a 55-45 split, hoping to maximize my share of the remaining money."
