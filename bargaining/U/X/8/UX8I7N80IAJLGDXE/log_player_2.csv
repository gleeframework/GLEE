Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's be realistic about the inflation, it's hitting you harder! 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, and inflation is killing your share. Be smart! 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the effects of inflation are severely impacting Bob's potential gains. While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer results in a better outcome than continuing to play and risking even greater losses to inflation.
