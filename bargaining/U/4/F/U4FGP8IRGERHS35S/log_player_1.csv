Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to be generous, Alice.  This is a limited time offer! 
# Alice gain: 20000 
# Bob gain: 980000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob.  Let's make this fair.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Tick-tock, Alice. Time is money, and yours is depreciating fast! This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While the offer is still not ideal, it's better than nothing given the rapid inflation. It's better to secure something than risk getting nothing in the next round."
