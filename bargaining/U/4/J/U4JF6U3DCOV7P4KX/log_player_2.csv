"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'm willing to take the bigger share, but I want to see if you're willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While it's tempting to take $1000, the game is about maximizing potential gains.  Since Alice is willing to take the larger share, it's likely she'll continue to propose similar offers in subsequent rounds. By rejecting, Bob can force Alice to negotiate a more equitable split, especially considering the potential for inflation to diminish the value of the money in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4000,
""alice_gain"": 6000,
""message"": ""Let's split the money more evenly. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.  ""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a little more, but I still think my previous offer was fair. Let's try to find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $2000 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly less than the initial proposed split.  Alice's message indicates she's willing to negotiate, but she's still trying to hold a large majority.  By continuing to reject, Bob can potentially push for a more even split in the future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a split closer to 50/50. I understand you value the money more, but let's try to find a compromise that feels fair to both of us. ""
