"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40 in my favor. You can try to negotiate if you'd like.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000. I'm leaving a bit more for Bob to try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a little more even this time.  I'm willing to split it 55-45 in your favor. It's a fair offer, and we can avoid losing money to inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the numbers are getting smaller, but the percentages are still in my favor.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. It's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing more value to inflation.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
