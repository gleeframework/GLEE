"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can split the remaining 100,000 in future rounds.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount in the first round, hoping that he'll accept and we can split the remaining amount in future rounds, where the money will be worth less due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no tricks! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob is offering a 50/50 split!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather accept the offer and get 500,000 now, rather than risking waiting for a future round where the money might be worth even less.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
