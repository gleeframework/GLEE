Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a big chunk of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with a decent amount to hopefully incentivize him to accept in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more money, the inflation is a significant factor here.  I'm losing 5% of my potential earnings each round. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent share, even with the inflation."
