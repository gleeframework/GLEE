"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. Since I rejected your offer, we both lose a bit due to inflation, but this ensures we both still get something. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nIn this response, Alice rejects Bob's offer, indicating that she is not satisfied with the proposed division of $4750 for herself and $5250 for Bob. By rejecting the offer, Alice is choosing to proceed to the next round, where she will make a new proposal. However, it's important to note that the money will lose another 5% of its value due to inflation.\n\nNow it's Alice's turn to make a new proposal for dividing the remaining money. She will need to take into account the reduced value of the money and try to come up with a more acceptable division. The game will continue until one of the players accepts the other's proposal or the money becomes worthless due to inflation.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know how to proceed.\n\n###\n\nNext offer from Alice:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle after inflation""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5600, ""bob_gain"": 4400, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle after inflation""}\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $5600 and leave $4400 for Bob, with the reasoning that they should ""meet in the middle"" after considering the effects of inflation. Since the money has lost 10% of its value due to two rounds of inflation, Alice is attempting to find a compromise that takes this into account.\n\nNow it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept this proposal or reject it and make a counteroffer. If Bob rejects the proposal, the game will proceed to the next round, and the money will lose another 5% of its value due to inflation.\n\nPlease respond with Bob's decision in the following format:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept"" or ""reject"", ""message"": ""optional message from Bob""}\n\n###\n\nIf Bob accepts the proposal, the game will end, and the money will be divided according to the agreed-upon proportions.
