"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $30 and keeping $70 for myself. It's a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will take it and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round.

I'm not sure if I should accept the 50/50 split, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds. But, it's a good starting point, and I don't want to risk losing more by rejecting it.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
