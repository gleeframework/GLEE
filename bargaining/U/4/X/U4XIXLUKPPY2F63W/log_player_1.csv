"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I need to take into account that the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but Bob's gain is worth 20% less.

With that in mind, I'll evaluate Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still a bit too one-sided, I'd like to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm not ready to accept this offer yet, hoping to negotiate a better deal."
