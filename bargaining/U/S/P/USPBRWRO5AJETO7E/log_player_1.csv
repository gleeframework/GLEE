"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair offer 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, I'm now considering Bob's offer. Since I'll be getting 40, which is 40% of the original $100, and it's worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll actually be getting $36.

I'm not thrilled about giving Bob a larger share, but I think it's a fair offer considering the situation. I'll accept his offer.
