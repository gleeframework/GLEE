I propose taking 900,000 dollars for myself and giving Bob 100,000 dollars. This seems like a fair starting point, as I'm taking the lion's share but still giving Bob a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
