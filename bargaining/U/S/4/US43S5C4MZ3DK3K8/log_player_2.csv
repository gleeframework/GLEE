# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to take advantage of my shrinking pot.  While the offer is slightly better than her last, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. I'm betting she'll get nervous as we get closer to the deadline and offer a larger share."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split this evenly and call it a day.  It's the fairest option for both of us.""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a tough game, but I need to remain firm. Offering a 50/50 split sends a clear message that I value fairness and am willing to walk away if necessary. The clock is ticking, and this offer gives us both a chance to benefit."

# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is getting desperate, but she's still trying to lowball me.  I need to hold strong, even though the inflation is starting to bite. It's a gamble, but I'm hoping she'll crack before I do."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, here's a compromise. Let's stop wasting time and take this deal.  We both know the clock is ticking.""}

**Reasoning:**

It's time to make a slight concession. I need to acknowledge the inflation pressure while still aiming for a reasonable share. This offer is a bit closer to her previous offers but maintains a slight advantage for me if we factor in the inflation.  The message is firm but also conveys a sense of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is on my side, and so is the math 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is getting dangerously close to losing everything.  While Alice's offer is still heavily skewed in her favor, the impact of inflation is becoming too significant to ignore. Accepting this offer ensures I at least get something, which is better than nothing if we run out of rounds."
