"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, Alice proposes to take $60, leaving Bob with $40, and sends a message suggesting that this division is somewhat fair but slightly biased in her favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This is a better deal for you than you'll see in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I believe I can negotiate for a better deal in the next rounds, despite the inflation. I also want to maintain a strong bargaining position by not giving in too early."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I've reduced my initial proposal to take into account Bob's offer and the pressure of inflation, while still trying to maintain a favorable division. My message conveys a sense of compromise while justifying my slightly higher share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly and end this. Each round gets worse for you, Alice. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nGiven the increasing impact of inflation on my potential gains, I've decided to accept Bob's offer to split the money evenly. While I initially hoped to negotiate a better deal, the decreasing value of the money with each round has shifted the balance in Bob's favor. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a guaranteed amount now rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
