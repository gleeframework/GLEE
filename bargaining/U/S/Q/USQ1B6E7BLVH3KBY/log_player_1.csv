"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 90% and you can have 10%.""
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm happy to split the money fairly.  Let's go with 55/45. This ensures a good outcome for both of us, and avoids the risk of inflation eating into our gains. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd rather take a bigger share to compensate for the loss in value. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has already reduced the value of the money, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in purchasing power. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Given the inflation, I think 70/30 is a more reasonable split. I'll take a larger share to ensure my gain doesn't get eroded further.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: With the inflation, I think we should aim for a 60/40 split.  This is a fair compromise considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential gains! Given the significant decrease in the value of the money, I think 60/40 is a reasonable compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid further erosion of my potential gains.
