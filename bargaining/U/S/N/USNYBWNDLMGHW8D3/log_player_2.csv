"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair deal: 90% for me, 10% for you. Let's start off on a good foot. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems ""fair"" at first glance, I'm not going to accept a measly 10% when I know I can likely get more.  It's early in the game, and I have plenty of rounds to try and negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, and we can both walk away with a substantial amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 60/40, with me taking the larger share. This is a good deal for both of us, considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice is offering a larger share than before, the value of the money is decreasing with every round. I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not in a hurry, and I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to go up to 60/40 in my favor.  It's important to remember that the money is losing value quickly, so let's find a solution that benefits us both before it's too late.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be practical.  The money is losing value quickly.  A 50/50 split is the fairest solution to maximize what we both get. We can't keep playing this game with shrinking returns. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly.  While I'd prefer a larger share, a 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances.  It's better than risking further losses and getting nothing at all."
