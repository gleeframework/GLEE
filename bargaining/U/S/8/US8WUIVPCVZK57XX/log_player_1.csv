Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor.  I figure this is a fair starting point, given Bob's higher inflation rate.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to let him!  I'll propose a better split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5250, ""bob_gain"": 4750}
```

I'm going to propose a 52.5/47.5 split in my favor.  This takes into account the inflation, but still gives Bob a significant share.  I think this is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the inflation is hitting me hard,  I'm going to accept this offer. I'm getting a 50/50 split, and it's better than risking even further losses in the next round."
