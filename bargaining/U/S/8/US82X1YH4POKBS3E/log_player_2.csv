# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Even though the value is decreasing, I need to remain firm to secure a fair outcome.  Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation working against me. It's risky, but I'm hoping she'll become more willing to negotiate a closer to even split as the rounds progress and she sees I won't be lowballed."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm standing my ground.  We need to close this deal soon, and this is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it.  We're running out of time and inflation is only hurting you more than me. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but time is running out.  While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting Alice's offer still guarantees me something.  If I reject this and we don't reach a deal, I'll get nothing, and the rapidly decreasing value makes each round more critical."
