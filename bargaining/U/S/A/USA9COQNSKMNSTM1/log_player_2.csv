"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm going to reject the offer.  Alice gets significantly more and there's a lot of rounds left to try and negotiate a better deal for myself.  Let's see what Alice offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's split it a little closer to even this time. I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still need to get a decent share.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle of our previous offers 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer.  While it's closer to even, I'm losing value faster than Alice and we're only halfway through the rounds.  I'm hoping to get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's just split it evenly. We're both losing money with each round, so it's in our best interest to reach a compromise now.""}
