"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think you can do better than that. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. Let's see if you'll meet me in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
