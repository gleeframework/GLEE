Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair to each other, Alice. I understand this offer benefits me more in the long run due to the inflation difference, but it's still a reasonable split considering we're only in round 2. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
