Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm not buying it. I think you'll still negotiate. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit my diminishing returns. While the deal is getting worse, accepting now is better than getting zero if we run out of rounds. However, I'm betting Alice will crack and offer a slightly better deal in the next round or two rather than risk getting nothing herself."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a near even split.  Don't be greedy, let's end this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I need to signal I'm getting serious while still leaving room for Alice to accept a deal that's slightly better for me.  Hopefully, she recognizes the significant risk of us both getting zero if this continues."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not being greedy, I'm being patient. Your share is worth less with each passing round. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","This is a tough one! Alice is right, my position is getting worse.  However, she's getting cocky. Let's push it a little further.

```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm banking on Alice getting nervous as we get closer to the deadline. There's a real chance she gets nothing, and I'm hoping that fear will drive her to offer a more reasonable split in the next round or two."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you win.  Let's split it down the middle and be done with this.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Time to go for the true 50/50 split. It stings to lose out on the potential gains due to inflation, but I need to prioritize getting *something* at this point.   Alice has shown she's willing to play hardball, and the risk of walking away with nothing is too high now. This is the safest option to ensure we both benefit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken one of my earlier offers. Now I'm in the driver's seat. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to run this down to the wire. While accepting this offer means losing out on a significant chunk of the initial value, getting $450,000 is much better than getting nothing.  The risk of holding out for a slightly better deal is too high now, especially considering the accelerating inflation working against me."
