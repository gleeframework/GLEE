"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 70% and you take 30%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, with me taking the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me more harshly than Bob.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to take a larger share to make up for it.

I'll reject Bob's offer and propose my own in the next round.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation is now affecting me even more, I'll have to be more aggressive with my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger share to account for the inflation. This is my best offer so far.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, with me taking a larger share to compensate for the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'll take 55% and you get 45%. It's a fair deal considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm not sure if it's the best deal for me. Considering the inflation is affecting me more harshly, I'm not sure if 45% is enough for me.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to push for an even better deal. Considering the inflation is still affecting me harshly, I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not budging much, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a fair deal considering the inflation, but I'm still hoping Bob will accept it."
