Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not bad, but I think I can do better than that!

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:
