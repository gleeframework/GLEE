"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think 3:1 is too harsh. I propose a 2:1 ratio in favor of Alice, considering the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
