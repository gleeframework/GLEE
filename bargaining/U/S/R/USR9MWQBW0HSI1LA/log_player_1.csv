Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor, knowing that Bob will have a higher discount on his share. I think this is a fair starting point that should give him some incentive to accept, especially given the discount he'll face if we continue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I get less than my initial offer, accepting this means I get to keep 500,000, which is still a significant amount. If I reject this offer, I risk getting a worse deal in the next round, as my share will be worth even less.  The 50/50 split is fair considering the discounts we're facing."
