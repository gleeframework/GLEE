"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 300k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit one-sided, but I'll consider it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject this offer because I don't think 300k is a fair share, considering the initial amount was 1 million. I'll wait for a better offer from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I've adjusted my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, while still keeping a decent amount for myself. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 350k, but I think I'm getting closer to a fair split 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the money's value! Considering the reduced value, I'll reassess Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept this offer, as it's a slightly better deal than my previous offer, and I'm getting closer to a resolution."
