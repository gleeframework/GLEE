"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take the lion's share this time, but I'm confident we can find a more equitable split in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'd like to propose a more equitable split in the next round. Alice's offer is too one-sided, and I believe we can find a better compromise. Let's proceed to the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice and let's move forward!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle for a fair share.""}\n\n###\nI've proposed a 50/50 split, which I believe is the most equitable division. I'm hoping Alice will see the fairness in this offer and accept it.\n\n###\n\nPlease relay this message to Alice and let's see how she responds!"
