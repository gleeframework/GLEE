Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the inflation is hitting you, but your last offer was too skewed. This is a compromise that acknowledges the situation but remains fair to us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Declining means greater losses:**  If I decline, the inflation will further devalue my potential earnings in the next round.
* **Alice is unlikely to offer more:**  Alice's offer acknowledges the inflation to some extent. Pushing for a significantly larger share in future rounds might be unrealistic and risks ending up with even less. 

While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures I secure a reasonable sum considering the circumstances."
