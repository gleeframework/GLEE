I propose a 90/10 split, with me getting $900,000 and Bob getting $100,000. This is a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I propose a 60/40 split, with me receiving $600,000 and Bob receiving $400,000.  This is a compromise that accounts for the inflation and acknowledges Bob's initial proposition, while still ensuring I receive a significant portion of the money."
