"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is more fair, considering we both have an equal chance to win the money. Let's settle this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the money I gain in Round 2 is worth 10% less than in Round 1, which means I'll be getting $540,000 (60% of $900,000).

Bob's offer is a 65-35 split, which is even more favorable to him than his initial proposal. I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, but I think it's a good opportunity to get a higher share than I initially proposed.

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
