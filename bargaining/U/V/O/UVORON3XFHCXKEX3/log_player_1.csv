"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 55% and you take 45%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a relatively even division of the initial $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's start with an even split. I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 90% of the original amount, which is $450,000. Bob's gain of $500,000 is now worth 95% of the original amount, which is $475,000.

I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
