I'm starting with a relatively generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal early on and avoid the inflation penalty."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most strategic choice.  The inflation penalty is starting to bite, and I risk getting nothing if I keep rejecting offers.  A 50/50 split is a fair outcome, especially considering the ongoing devaluation."
