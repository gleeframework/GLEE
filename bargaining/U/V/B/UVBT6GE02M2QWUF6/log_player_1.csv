"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose that Alice receives $900,000 and Bob receives $100,000. I'm keeping the majority for myself, but leaving a small amount for Bob in hopes that he'll accept the offer. It's better to take something than risk getting nothing in the later rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I accept Bob's offer. Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, getting 500,000 is better than risking getting nothing in the later rounds. It's a fair split, and I'm happy to take it."
