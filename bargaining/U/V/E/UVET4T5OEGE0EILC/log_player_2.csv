Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. This way we both benefit from ending the game early and avoid losing money to inflation.

# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Your offer was a bit too one-sided, Alice. I'm proposing a 55/45 split in my favor.  Let's be realistic - you lose more with each round than I do.  Take it while it's still a good deal for you.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's stop playing games. I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this fairly.  Each round that passes hurts us both, and this ensures we both get a guaranteed, reasonable share. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
