"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where I would receive $5,000 and Bob would receive $5,000."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but I think I deserve a bit more since I'm the one making the offer this time! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me $4,000 and Bob $6,000. I was hoping for a more balanced split, and this offer is too skewed in Bob's favor. I'll reject it and hope to do better in the next round."

I'm proposing a compromise, where I would receive $5,500 and Bob would receive $4,500. I'm trying to make a more balanced offer, but still hoping to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to give up that much. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives me $3,500 and Bob $6,500. The gap between our gains is still too large, and I'm not convinced that Bob is willing to make a fair deal. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."

I'm proposing a compromise, where I would receive $4,800 and Bob would receive $5,200. I'm trying to find a balance that works for both of us, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly better deal in hopes of getting a deal done."
