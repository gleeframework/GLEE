"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10} 
```

I'm starting with a pretty lopsided offer, knowing the money will lose value with each round. I'm hoping Bob will accept this, as I have a better chance of getting more money if we go through more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is significantly more generous than my initial one, I still believe I can secure a better deal in the future. I'll reject his offer and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20} 
```

I'm going to offer a slightly lower amount for myself than the first round, but still much higher than Bob's offer. I believe this will be attractive enough to Bob to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than the previous round, it's still far from ideal, and the inflation is making my potential earnings much lower.  I'll reject this and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still leaving Bob with a decent share. I'm hoping the threat of further rounds and inflation will convince him to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is starting to look more appealing because of the increasing inflation, I'm still holding out for a slightly better deal. I think there's room for negotiation. I'll reject and see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40} 
```

I'm lowering my offer one last time, but still maintaining a significant share. With the increasing inflation, I'm hoping this is enough to entice Bob to accept and avoid further rounds.  I'm willing to take a bit less to get a deal done before the value of the money drops too low."
