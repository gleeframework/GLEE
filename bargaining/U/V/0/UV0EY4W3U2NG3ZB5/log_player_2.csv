Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.

# Alice's message: I'll meet you halfway on the last offer, but I still want the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more even split, time is working against me much faster than her. It's still beneficial to hold out for a better offer, even if it means risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Time is running out. Let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, moving closer to a 50/50 split. With the increasing inflation rate rapidly eroding my potential gains, it's time to secure a fair deal before it's too late.  A 50/50 split ensures we both walk away with something, maximizing our combined gains at this stage."
