"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than my previous proposal, and the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'm not going to settle for such a low share. Let's see what I can negotiate in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm raising my offer to Bob, but still aiming for a larger share for myself. It's getting riskier with each round, but I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly less than what I was initially aiming for, and the inflation is starting to really bite. I'm not going to settle for such a low share. I'm hoping to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm making a slight concession here,  but still aiming for a larger share than Bob's last offer.  With the increasing inflation, we're both losing money, so it's time for a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer is still less than what I was originally aiming for, the inflation has significantly reduced the value of the money. Accepting this offer will at least secure a decent amount of money, considering the potential for further losses due to inflation."
