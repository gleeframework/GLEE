Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose to take 9000$ and give Bob 1000$. This seems fair, considering he will be getting a smaller share in subsequent rounds due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
