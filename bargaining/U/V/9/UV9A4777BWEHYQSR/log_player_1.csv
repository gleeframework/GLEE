"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. This is a relatively even split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept to avoid wasting time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted a fair split, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiating with you! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of me! 

I'm not convinced that I should get only $4,000, especially since the money is worth 10% less now than it was in the first round. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to compensate for the decrease in value.

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""You think you deserve more? I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You think I'm trying to take advantage of you? I'm willing to meet you halfway and make it a 50/50 split. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","A 50/50 split sounds like a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the money has decreased significantly. I'm not sure if I can do better than this, and it's a fair offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
