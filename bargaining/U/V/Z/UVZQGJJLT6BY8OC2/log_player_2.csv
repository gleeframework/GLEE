Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's go for a 50/50 split this time. It's fair and avoids further inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting the 50/50 split in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The longer the game goes on, the less the money is worth to Bob.  He's losing value at a faster rate than Alice.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Holding out for a slightly better deal in later rounds is very risky. There's no guarantee Alice will offer more, and even a small increase might not outweigh the losses from inflation.
* **Fairness:**  While Bob's initial offer was also reasonable, Alice has signaled she's willing to compromise. A 50/50 split is inherently fair and prevents a complete stalemate. 

In short, accepting now locks in a decent amount, even if it's not the maximum Bob could have gotten.  Delaying further puts Bob at a significant disadvantage due to the inflation mechanic."
