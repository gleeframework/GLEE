"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob. I'll give you a decent share, but don't expect too much.""
}
```

This way, I'll get 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to be generous. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 4000 is still worth 4000, but Bob's gain of 6000 is now worth 5400 (since it's 10% less than the original 6000).

I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I think it's a decent compromise. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
