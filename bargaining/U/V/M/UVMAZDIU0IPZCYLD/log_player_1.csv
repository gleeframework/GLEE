"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the total amount, which is $4,000, and I'll take $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's start with a 50-50 split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, my gain of $5,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, and Bob's gain of $5,000 is worth 80% of what it was in the first round.

I'll think for a moment...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's 50-50 offer."
