"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```
I'm offering to take 60% of the original $10,000, and Bob will get the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd like to adjust my offer accordingly. However, Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a significant improvement from my previous offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
