"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, then we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm suggesting that we reassess the division in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a decent offer. Let's see if you'll accept it. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

After considering Bob's offer, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better, especially considering the inflation factor. I'd like to propose my own offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is worth 40% less than in the first round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to balance the risk of inflation with a reasonable offer. Let's see if you'll accept this one.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still trying to mitigate the effects of inflation on my own gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and give you a smaller share, but I think it's still a fair offer considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite, my gain is worth significantly less. Considering Bob's offer, I'll:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, although it's not ideal, the inflation is making it increasingly difficult to hold out for a better deal. I think 3000 is a decent compromise given the circumstances."
