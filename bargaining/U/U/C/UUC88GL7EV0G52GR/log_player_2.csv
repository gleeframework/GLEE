"Round 1

# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm Bob, and I'm going to try to get the best deal possible. While Alice's offer is fair, it's not the best for me. I'll try to get more in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay Bob, let's try this again.  My last offer was more than fair, but I'm willing to compromise a little to get this done. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice is still trying to get a better deal, but I'm not going to accept anything less than 50% of the money.  It's my turn next, and I'm going to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to compromise a bit, but I need more than 35%.  Let's split it 60/40, and we can both walk away happy.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I came down on my offer, now you need to come up.  This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

Alice is getting impatient, and the inflation is starting to hurt. I'd rather have something than nothing, so I'll accept this offer."
