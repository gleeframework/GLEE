"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

This offer gives me 80% of the original $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets $2,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Seems fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to split it evenly, huh? That's a bold move!

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'd rather take a smaller share now than risk getting even less in future rounds. I'll accept Bob's offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
