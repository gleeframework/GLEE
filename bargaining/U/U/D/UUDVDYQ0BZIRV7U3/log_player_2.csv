"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm being generous, but I know you'll appreciate this opportunity to get started. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next.  100,000 is a very small share, and there's still a lot of money on the table. I'll see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly. This is a good starting point for both of us.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get a better deal than Bob's last offer. This is fair for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting. Alice's offer is a good compromise, and accepting ensures I get something. The inflation is working against me, so it's better to secure a decent amount now."
