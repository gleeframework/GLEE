Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're losing value fast, take this deal 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the pressure is on with inflation working against me, accepting an offer where I get less than 50% is a bad strategy. I need to try and push for a more even split, knowing that Alice is likely aware that my position worsens with each round."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""Alice, this isn't sustainable. We both lose if we run out of time. I'm making another fair offer. Let's close this out.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time's running out, this is my best offer yet 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  The situation has become critical. With each round, the inflation eats away at my potential gains. While 3900 is far from ideal, it's better than walking away with nothing if Alice continues to reject my offers. This late in the game, it's too risky to hold out for a better deal."
