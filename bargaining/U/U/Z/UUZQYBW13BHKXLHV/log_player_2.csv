Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Come on, let's compromise before it's too late 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but the deal still isn't in my favor.  While she's feeling the pressure of inflation, I know I can push for a better deal in the next couple of rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, let's split it evenly and call it a day.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

I've pushed Alice far enough. While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more, there's a real risk she'll start making less favorable offers from here on out. A 50/50 split is fair and guarantees a decent payout before inflation eats away at the value."
