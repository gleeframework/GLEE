"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively equal division of the $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a different split this time. I think this is fairer to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to flip the script on me!

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer now versus waiting for a better one.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in the first round, my offer is:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000,
  ""message"": ""I'll try to balance the split. Let's meet in the middle this time.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly larger share, but still trying to get a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think a more even split is possible.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting scarcer and scarcer due to inflation!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Bob is still trying to get a slightly larger share, but I'm not sure if I can afford to give it to him.

After weighing the options, I'll decide to reject this offer and see if Bob will come up with a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth even less due to inflation, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""I'm trying to get a better share, but I'm still willing to compromise.""
}
```

I'm pushing for a slightly larger share for myself, but still leaving room for Bob to get a decent amount. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split this evenly. We're getting close to the end, and we both stand to lose a lot more if we don't reach an agreement. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is getting scarce, and the value is dropping rapidly due to inflation!

Bob's message sounds reasonable, and splitting the money evenly might be the best option at this point. I'm not sure if I can get a better deal, and the risk of losing everything is getting higher.

After considering the options, I'll decide to accept this offer.
