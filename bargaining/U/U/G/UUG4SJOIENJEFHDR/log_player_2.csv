"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the disadvantage we both face with inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it heavily favors her. With the inflation rates, I'm better off taking a chance and hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, Alice. An even split is the most reasonable way to divide the money, given the inflation affecting us both.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the idea of a split, but the inflation affects me more. This offer is a compromise. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I still believe an even split is the most fair, the inflation is becoming a serious issue.  Alice's offer is a compromise, and given the diminishing value of the money, I'm willing to accept it."
