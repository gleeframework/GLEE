"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that we divide the $10,000 equally, with each of us getting $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair deal, considering the inflation. You get a good chunk, and I get a slightly bigger share to compensate for the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I think I deserve a bigger share considering the initial split was supposed to be equal. The 20% decrease in value is a significant hit, and I'm not willing to accept such a drastic change in the split. I'd like to make a new offer and try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the initial split. This way, we both get a decent share, and I'm willing to make some concessions for the inflation.""}

I'm proposing a slightly more uneven split, with me getting $5,500 and Bob getting $4,500. I'm trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the inflation and still gives me a decent share."
