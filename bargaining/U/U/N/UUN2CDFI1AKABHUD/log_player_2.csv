Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. The clock is ticking, and this offer still gives you a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. The inflation is hurting my potential gain, and this back and forth isn't helping either of us. Let's be fair and split it evenly.""}
