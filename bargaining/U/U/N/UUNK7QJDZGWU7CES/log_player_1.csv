"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $200,000, which is 20% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to give away too much 
# Alice gain: 700000 
# Bob gain: 300000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of $800,000 in the first round is now worth $720,000, and Bob's offer of $700,000 is still a bit less than that.

I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this more generous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away too much more 
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of $800,000 is now worth $583,200, and Bob's offer of $580,000 is very close to that amount.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair split and I'm not willing to risk going into further rounds.
