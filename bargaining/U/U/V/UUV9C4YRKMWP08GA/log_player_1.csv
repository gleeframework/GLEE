"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}

I'm offering you 20 dollars, and I'll take 80 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'd like to consider the effective gains in terms of the original value.

In the first round, the total gain was $100, and in the second round, the total gain is $90 (due to inflation). Bob's offer in the second round is $50 each, which is 50% of the $90 total gain.

In the first round, my offer was 80% of the total gain, and Bob's offer was 20%. Now, in the second round, Bob's offer is 50% of the total gain, which is the same as my initial offer in the first round.

Considering this, I'll accept Bob's offer.
