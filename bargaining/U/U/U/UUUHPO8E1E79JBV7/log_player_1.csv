Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, giving me $900,000 and Bob $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with the 10/90 split, I'm definitely not accepting it this early in the game. The inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, and I can't afford to give up this much money already. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a 80/20 split.  While the inflation is affecting me, I still think I can secure a larger share than Bob's offer.  Let's see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with the 20/80 split, even with the inflation hitting Bob harder. I believe I can still secure a larger share of the money. I'll propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to try one more time with a 70/30 split. This is getting close to the point where I'm willing to accept something, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  We'll see if Bob's willing to budge."
