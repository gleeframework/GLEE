"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose to keep 90% of the money and give Bob 10%. This is a reasonable starting point that allows for potential negotiation in the future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. This is a compromise from my previous offer, acknowledging that Bob has some bargaining power.  I believe this is a fair offer that gives us both a significant share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I continue to reject Bob's offers. While the money is depreciating, I believe my position remains stronger and I can negotiate a better deal for myself.  I will continue to counter-propose in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I am proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, aiming to reach a deal while still securing a substantial share of the money.  I am adjusting to the inflation and seeking a compromise that we both can accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While I am feeling the effects of inflation, I will continue to reject Bob's offers.  The 450,000 offer is a significantly smaller share than I believe I can achieve.  I'll continue to counter-propose in the coming rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. This is a significant compromise, recognizing the increasing pressure of inflation, but I believe it is a fair deal considering my position. It is a slight increase from Bob's previous offer, showing my willingness to meet halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. With the inflation rate, my gains are significantly reduced, and at this point, a 50/50 split is the best I can hope for. It's time to secure some of the money before the inflation eats away any more of it."
