"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

This is a relatively generous offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can avoid the inflation that will kick in soon!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 5000$ is now worth less than my initial gain of 9000$. I'll have to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation has taken a toll on my potential gain, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will be willing to accept this offer, given the increasing value of the money over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a big hit on my potential gain. With my gain being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be careful.

However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, considering the current state of the money. I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
