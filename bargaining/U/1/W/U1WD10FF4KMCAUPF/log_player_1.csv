"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a slightly unfair offer, hoping Bob will accept it and we can both get the game over quickly.  If he rejects, I'll have to be more careful about my offers in the future as the inflation risk increases."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is fair, and since it's a 50/50 split, I don't see any reason to risk further inflation."
