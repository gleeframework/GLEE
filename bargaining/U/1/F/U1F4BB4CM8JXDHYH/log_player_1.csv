"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","### Step 1: Determine the initial offer
Given the rules of the game, it's strategic to start with an offer that is somewhat favorable to me (Alice) but still reasonable enough for Bob to consider, keeping in mind the looming threat of inflation which pressures both parties to reach an agreement sooner rather than later.

### Step 2: Calculate the impact of inflation
With each passing round, the money loses 5% of its value. This means that in each subsequent round, the total value of the money decreases, making an early agreement more valuable than a later one.

### Step 3: Formulate the offer
Considering the need to balance between making an attractive offer to Bob and maximizing my own gain, I will propose a division that gives me slightly more than half but still leaves Bob with a substantial amount, hoping he'll see the benefit in accepting early.

### Step 4: Attach a persuasive message
The message should emphasize the benefit of accepting the offer early to avoid the loss of value due to inflation, encouraging Bob to accept rather than risking less value in subsequent rounds.

### Step 5: Finalize the offer and message
Given these considerations, I will offer Bob 45 dollars, keeping 55 dollars for myself, and include a message urging him to accept the offer to maximize the value we both receive.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""Accept now to avoid losing value due to inflation!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly and avoid further loss from inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### Step 1: Evaluate Bob's offer
Bob has offered an even split, which on the surface seems fair. However, considering the effects of inflation, the value of the money has already decreased by 5% from the original amount.

### Step 2: Calculate the current value of the offer
Given the 5% decrease, the $100 is now worth $95. This means that Bob's offer of an even split would give each of us $47.50 in original value terms.

### Step 3: Consider the strategic implications
Accepting the offer would mean I am agreeing to a 50/50 split after one round of inflation has already reduced the value. However, rejecting it and pushing for another round risks further devaluation but also gives me a chance to counteroffer and potentially gain more.

### Step 4: Weigh the pros and cons
Given the relatively fair offer and the risk of further value loss, it might be prudent to accept the offer to secure a known quantity rather than gamble on future negotiations, especially since the difference in value lost to inflation in subsequent rounds might not justify the risk of not reaching an agreement.

### Step 5: Make a decision
Considering the above points, I will accept Bob's offer to ensure a predictable outcome and avoid the risk of further value loss due to inflation.

The final answer is:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
