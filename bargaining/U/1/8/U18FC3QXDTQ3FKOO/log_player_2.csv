"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I propose we split the money 60/40, giving you a good share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the offer seems fair on the surface, Alice is impacted by inflation much more than Bob. It's in Bob's best interest to wait for a better offer as the value of the money decreases faster for Alice."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Your money is losing value quickly, Alice. Let's be realistic. I'll take the larger share this time.""} 

**Reasoning:** This offer flips the script on Alice, offering her the same proportion she initially proposed but with the roles reversed. This leverages the inflation mechanic â€“ Alice is incentivized to accept a less favorable deal now before the money's value diminishes further for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob.  The money is losing value for both of us. We should split it evenly and avoid risking getting nothing. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation and is now proposing a 50/50 split.  While this is better than her initial offer, Bob is still in a strong position.  The inflation is affecting Alice much more severely, so there's a high chance she'll concede even further in the next round to avoid getting nothing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice, and the money is disappearing. Take this offer before it's too late.""}

**Reasoning:** Bob should push his advantage slightly while still offering Alice a reasonable amount. This maintains pressure without seeming overly greedy and potentially scaring Alice into rejecting reasonable offers out of principle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing money with every round. I'm willing to take less, but we need to come to an agreement soon. 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is finally back to her initial offer of a 60/40 split. While Bob could potentially push for more, the risk is starting to outweigh the reward. We're over halfway through the rounds, and Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation. Accepting now guarantees a good share of the money, whereas continuing to negotiate could backfire and lead to both players getting nothing."
