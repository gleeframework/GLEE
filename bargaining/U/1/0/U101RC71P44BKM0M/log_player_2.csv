Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want a significant share.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to avoid this dragging out and losing us both money in the long run. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I initially aimed for a higher share, Alice's final offer of a 50/50 split is the most logical at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money for Alice is decreasing rapidly with each round.  While my amount remains the same, it's becoming increasingly unlikely she'll accept a deal where she gets significantly less than half.
* **Finality:** Her ""final offer"" statement adds weight. Rejecting this means we enter another round where I'm forced to propose an even split or risk getting nothing if she rejects and the game ends. 

A 50/50 split guarantees me a substantial sum and avoids the risk of ending up with nothing.
