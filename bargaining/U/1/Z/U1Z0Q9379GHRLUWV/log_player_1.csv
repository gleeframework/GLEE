"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $10,000, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try 50-50, a fair split! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. Since the money is worth 20% less now, my gain of $5000 is equivalent to $4000 in the previous round's value.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. It's a 50-50 split, which is a fair offer, but I was hoping to get a better deal earlier. On the other hand, I don't want to risk going into further rounds and losing even more value due to inflation.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
