Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's start with 5500 for me and 4500 for you. This gives us both a decent amount and avoids too much back and forth. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
