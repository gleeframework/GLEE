"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take 80 and you get 20. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the money, leaving Bob with 20%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm curious to see how Bob will respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the middle ground, no need to be greedy 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a 50-50 split, which seems reasonable considering the reduced value of the money.
