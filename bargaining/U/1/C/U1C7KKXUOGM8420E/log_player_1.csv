"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the game's inflation mechanics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's be realistic 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me in this round, I'm not as eager to give up as much as I was in the first round.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, meet me in the middle.""
}
```"

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000
