"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I get a bit more since I'm losing money over time. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my friend, let's be reasonable. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n###\n\nSince Alice's gain is worth 19% less now, her offer of $5800 is actually equivalent to around $4700 in the first round. I think I can still get a better deal.\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fair offer. If you don't accept, I'll keep going.""}"
