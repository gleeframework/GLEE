This is a tough situation, but rejecting is too risky now. Here's why:

* **Declining value:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for me. Waiting longer means getting even less in the end.
* **Bob's position:** Bob seems set on getting at least $6,000. He's likely to keep pushing for a better deal in later rounds. 
* **Potential for worse:** If I reject and Bob offers even less next round, I'll be in a much weaker position.

While $4,000 is less than I hoped for, it's better to take a less-than-ideal deal now than risk getting even less later."
