**Reasoning:**

Alice is panicking a bit due to the inflation heavily impacting her share. While she's moving closer to a more even split, I believe I can get a better deal as the pressure increases on her with each passing round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 510000,
""alice_gain"": 490000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close.  51/49 is my final offer - let's settle this before inflation eats away any more of your share.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure Point:** Alice is feeling the heat of inflation. Offering a slight concession while still heavily in my favor might be enough to tip the scales.
* **Finality:** Presenting this as my ""final offer"" adds weight and urgency for her to accept. 
* **Greed vs. Loss:**  There's always the risk Alice will gamble on getting a slightly better deal later, but the steadily decreasing value of her potential gains should outweigh that risk."
