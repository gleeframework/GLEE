"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game on a good note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the proposal this round! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 20% less for me, so I'll gain $32 (40 * 0.8). Bob's gain of $60 is worth 5% less, so it's equivalent to $57.

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. I don't think I'm getting a fair deal, especially since I'm the one who made the first proposal and got rejected. I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.

```

# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, so I'll gain $5.20 (25 * 0.208). Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less, so it's equivalent to $66.48.
