"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a generous 40% of the original $100. I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40, it's a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Inflation has taken a bite out of my potential gain. My offer in Round 1 was worth $60, but now it's worth $54 (60% of $90, since the money is worth 10% less).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. His offer is actually slightly worse than my original offer, since I'd get $45 (40% of $112.5, since the money is worth 10% less than in Round 1) if I had accepted my original offer. But, I don't want to wait for another round and risk losing even more value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
