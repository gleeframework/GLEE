"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose a split of $9,000 for me and $1,000 for Bob. This is a generous offer, and it ensures we both get a decent share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, this is a fair offer given the inflation and the limited number of rounds. Accepting ensures I get something, and it's a decent amount compared to potentially getting nothing if we keep rejecting."
