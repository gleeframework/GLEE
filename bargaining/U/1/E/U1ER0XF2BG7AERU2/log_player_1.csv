"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the majority share""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $10,000, which is $8,000, and Bob gets the remaining 20%, which is $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share, but it's still a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

After considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up more than I initially proposed. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept Bob's offer, but I'll try to negotiate further in the next round.
