"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. It's a generous offer, but I'm hoping it's good enough to get us to agree on a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 10% less than before, so I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With inflation affecting my gain again, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the decreasing value of my share due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering the offer from Bob, I'll accept it. At least we'll both get a share, and I'll take the $500,000.
