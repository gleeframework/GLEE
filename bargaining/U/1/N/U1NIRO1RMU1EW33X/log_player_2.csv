"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 60/40 split to start. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for a better offer. The current proposal gives Alice a larger share, and I'm hoping to get a more favorable split. Additionally, since the money is worth less with each passing round, I'm willing to take the risk of waiting for a potentially better offer. Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced split. Considering the inflation, this is a fair offer.""}\n\n###\nI'm taking into account that with each round, the money's value decreases, affecting both of us but more significantly impacting Alice. My offer aims to find a middle ground that might be acceptable to both parties, considering the devaluation of money over rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money! My turn to propose a more balanced split - let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\nConsidering the impact of inflation on both our gains, Alice's offer seems reasonable at this point. The money's value is decreasing significantly with each round, and accepting this offer ensures I receive a tangible amount rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds. Given the circumstances, accepting this proposal appears to be the most prudent decision."
