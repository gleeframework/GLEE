I'm going for a fairly aggressive offer in the first round. I want to secure a large portion of the money, but still leave room for negotiation if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer. While I'm now losing more value due to inflation, I'm still willing to fight for a better share. I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split this time. Bob's offer in the previous round was too unfavorable, and I think this offer is a fair compromise."
