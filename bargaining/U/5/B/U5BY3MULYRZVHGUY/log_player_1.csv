# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. On one hand, Bob is offering me a slightly bigger share, but on the other hand, the money is worth less due to inflation.

I'll think about it for a moment... Ah, I've decided!

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 30, I'm going to try to get a better deal this time. I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split.

# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With that in mind, I'm going to have to think carefully about this offer.

At first glance, 80% for me and 20% for Bob seems like a good deal, but considering the inflation, I'm not sure if it's enough. I'm going to have to weigh the pros and cons...

{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm going to try to get a better deal this time. Since Bob's offer was 20, I'm going to try to get a bit more.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting desperate, but I'll give you most of it if you'll just take it 
# Alice gain: 90 
# Bob gain: 10 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, Bob is really getting desperate! With the inflation taking a huge toll on the value of the money, I'm starting to get a bit more concerned about the future.

However, 90% for me and 10% for Bob is a pretty good deal, considering the circumstances. I'm not sure if I can do better than this, and I don't want to risk getting nothing if we don't divide the money soon.
