Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: You should consider time is running out for you 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Time is running out for both of us. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option now.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your loss is my gain, literally 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage. While time is ticking, accepting an offer where I continuously get less than a fair share is not acceptable. I need to show strength and willingness to risk it all to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 4800, ""alice_gain"": 5200, ""message"": ""This is my final compromise. Take it or leave it - we both lose out if this goes on.""}

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is on. Alice is being incredibly stubborn, likely betting on my desperation as inflation eats into my potential gains. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a reasonable deal.  This offer is still skewed in Alice's favor, but it's the best chance I have of securing a significant amount before the diminishing returns make it pointless."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not budging, you're the one losing value 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball, and time is no longer my ally. The value of the money I'm losing each round is becoming significant, and I need to cut my losses. This offer is far from ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing, which is becoming increasingly likely if I continue to reject her offers."
