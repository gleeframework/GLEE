# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not getting a fair share, and I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. This time, the offer is even more skewed in his favor, with him getting 70% of the money. I'm not willing to accept a deal that leaves me with such a small share, especially considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."

# Bob gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. The offer is still heavily skewed in his favor, and I'm not willing to accept such a small share. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I need to make sure I get a fair share while there's still value left. I'll try to negotiate for a better deal in the next round."
