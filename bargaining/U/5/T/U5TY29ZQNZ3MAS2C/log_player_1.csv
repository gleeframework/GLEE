"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent chunk of money, and we can reassess our strategies in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 80% and leave you with 20%, Alice. It's a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation!

I'll reject his offer. I'd rather wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Time to make a new offer!

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more this time, Bob. But don't think you're getting off that easy!""
}
```

I'm trying to balance my gain with the risk of inflation, while also keeping some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, Alice. Take 30% and leave me with 70% 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is still trying to take the lead!

I'll reject his offer again. The 30% offer is still a bit too low for me, considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, Bob. 50/50 split. No more games.""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive and aim for a fair split, but with a slight bias towards my own gain."
