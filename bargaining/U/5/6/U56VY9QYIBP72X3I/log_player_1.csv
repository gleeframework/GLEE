"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80/20, I'll get a good chunk for the effort!""
}
```

This way, I get 80% of the initial 100$, and Bob gets 20%. The message is just a friendly nudge to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's be fair! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of 50$ is worth 80% of the original amount, which is 40$.

I don't think I'm getting a good deal with this offer. I'd like to propose a counteroffer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Too low for me, let's try again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In this round, my gain is worth 64% of the original amount (80% of 80% of 100$).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I need a bigger share!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bit more, but I think 40 is fair for you too! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, my gain of 40$ is worth 51.2% of the original amount (100% - 48.8%).

I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'm willing to accept it since it's getting harder to make a better deal with each passing round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, you got a good deal, I guess!""
}
