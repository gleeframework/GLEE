Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too much in your favor, Alice.  Let's be fair - this is a good split considering the money will be worth less if we wait any longer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
