I'm still aiming for a better deal, even with the high inflation.  Let's see if I can push for more in the next round."

While I'd still prefer more, with only one round left and Bob's share being worth almost nothing, it's better to accept this offer. There's a high chance we'll both get nothing if I reject this."
