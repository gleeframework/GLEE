"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You started high, now I'll counter 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a more favorable deal for himself.

I'll consider the offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's not in my favor. I was hoping for a more even split, but Bob's proposal gives him a 70/30 advantage. I'll wait for his next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""You're trying to take too much, Bob. Let's meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still trying to get a better deal for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You went up, now I'll try to meet you 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to find a compromise.

I'll consider the offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because it's still not in my favor. I was hoping for a more even split, and this proposal still gives Bob a 60/40 advantage. I'll wait for his next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, Bob! But I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm pushing for a slightly better deal, trying to get closer to an even split. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not backing down, Alice! Time to meet in the middle 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is still trying to get a better deal.

I'll consider the offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's the closest we've gotten to an even split so far, and I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value in the money."
