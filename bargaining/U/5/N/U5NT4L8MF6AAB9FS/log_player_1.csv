"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm proposing a 90/10 split in my favor. It's a good starting point, but I'm aware of the inflation factor. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly less than my initial proposal. While the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm still confident I can secure a better deal.  I'll reject and see what he offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 60/40 split in my favor.  Bob's last offer was unacceptable, but I'm willing to compromise to avoid further inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth significantly less now, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. It's a better deal than my last proposal, and the potential for further inflation is high.  It's time to secure some of the money while I can."
