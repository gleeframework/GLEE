"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Take the smaller share this round and we can negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share this round, but I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this round, but still willing to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, Bob's offer is now worth less than it was in the first round. I'll consider it carefully.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better than a 60-40 split. I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation still affecting the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this round. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""Time to take control, Bob. You're not getting a bigger share without a fight!""
}
```

I'm increasing my share again, but still leaving some room for Bob to negotiate. Let's see if he'll take this offer or try to push for more."

# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger toll on Bob's share, I'll consider his offer. A 50-50 split is a reasonable compromise, but I'm not sure if I'm ready to give up my advantage just yet.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can get a better deal if I push Bob harder. A 50-50 split might be fair, but I'm not willing to settle for it just yet."

  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob. Take it or leave it!""

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a significant toll on Bob's share, I'll consider his new offer. However, I'm still not convinced that I should give him a larger share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I'm still in a strong position. Bob's share is now worth significantly less than it was in the first round, and I'm not willing to give him a larger share at this point. I'll wait for his next move."

  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time and money, Bob. This is my final offer!""

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I'm in a strong position to negotiate. Bob's share is now worth a tiny fraction of what it was in the first round, and I'm not willing to give him a larger share. I'll wait for his next move, but I'm not optimistic about his chances."

  ""alice_gain"": 9500,
  ""bob_gain"": 500,
  ""message"": ""You're out of options, Bob. This is the best you'll get.""
}
```

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because it's the best I'm going to get at this point. Bob is giving up a significant amount of money, and I'm taking the majority of what's left. It's not the most favorable outcome, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
