"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:**  The value of the money is decreasing rapidly for Alice. It makes sense that she's getting more desperate for a deal.
* **My Position:** While I'd prefer my Round 2 offer, Alice's Round 3 offer is still better than what I was offered in Round 1. Waiting any longer risks her offering even less. 
* **""Bird in Hand"" Principle:** It's better to accept a decent offer now than risk getting a worse offer later due to the declining value of the money for Alice."
