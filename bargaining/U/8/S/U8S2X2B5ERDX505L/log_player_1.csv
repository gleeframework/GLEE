"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. Let's end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that a 60/40 split is fair, especially considering the inflation is affecting me more than Bob. I'll wait for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but don't expect me to go any higher!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,800 and keeping $4,200 for myself, taking into account the 10% inflation that affects my gain."
