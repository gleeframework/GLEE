550000.0,450000.0,"Alice, I understand you're playing hardball, but this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering you a larger share than my previous offer.  Let's settle this before inflation eats away at any potential gains for me.",Bob,6,

650000.0,350000.0,"You're right, this is getting ridiculous. But I'm the one with the upper hand here. Inflation is crippling your gains, and I'm not going to let up. Take this offer or risk getting even less",Alice,7,
