Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're right, this is getting ridiculous. But I'm the one with the upper hand here. Inflation is crippling your gains, and I'm not going to let up. Take this offer or risk getting even less 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly exploiting the inflation mechanism, but her offer is getting greedier.  It's time to show I'm serious about walking away if she doesn't negotiate fairly.  There's a chance she'll offer something better in the next round to avoid losing everything."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 400000,
""alice_gain"": 600000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is non-productive. I'm standing firm at this offer to demonstrate I'm serious.  If you reject this, I'm not negotiating further.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Resolve:**  By offering the same amount as Alice's original offer (which was already generous to her),  I'm signaling I'm willing to walk away.
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct, leaving no room for misinterpretation. I'm setting a firm boundary.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk Alice will reject this, but it might be the push she needs to make a real concession before time runs out."
