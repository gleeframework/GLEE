"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob gets the remaining 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. I'd like to make a counteroffer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll propose a new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm willing to give up a bit more to get closer to a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth 20% less than in the first round. I'll take that into account in my new offer.

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}

I'm proposing a slightly more aggressive split in my favor, considering the decreasing value of money due to inflation."
