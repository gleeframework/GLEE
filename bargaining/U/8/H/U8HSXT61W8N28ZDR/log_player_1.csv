"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you think?""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% and leaving 40% for Bob. I'm hoping this is a good starting point for negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. This split is more equitable, considering the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, I'd rather not take the hit on the value of my share. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

}
```

I'm trying to get back to a fair split, considering the inflation."
