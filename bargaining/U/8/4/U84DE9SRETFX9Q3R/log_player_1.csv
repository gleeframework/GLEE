"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering to take 60% of the original $100 and leave Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced values due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully.

I'll reject this offer:
```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```
I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my new offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```
I'm now offering a 50-50 split, hoping to avoid further losses due to inflation."
