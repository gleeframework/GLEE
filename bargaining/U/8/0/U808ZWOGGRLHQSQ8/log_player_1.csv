"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slightly more generous offer, but still a good deal for me 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money I gain is worth 5% less, so I'll have to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is still quite generous, considering I'll get 400,000.

I'll accept this offer.
