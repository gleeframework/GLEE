"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 60/40 split, with me taking 60% and you 40%. While I acknowledge your point about value depreciation, I believe this split is more equitable considering the potential for further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000
