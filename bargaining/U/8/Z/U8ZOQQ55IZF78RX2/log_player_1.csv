"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This way, I get a decent amount of money to start with, while still leaving Bob with a reasonable share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money, I'll need to be more aggressive in my negotiation. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 40/60, I'll try to shift the ratio in my favor. I'll offer 55/45, hoping to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```"
