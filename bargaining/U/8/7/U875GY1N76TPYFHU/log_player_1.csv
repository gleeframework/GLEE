"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start, then we can reassess in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer."

Round 2

# Bob's message: You're not willing to give me a fair share, I'll try to get more this time! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000
