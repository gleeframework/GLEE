"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about it. With the inflation, the $4000 I would gain in this round is equivalent to $3800 in the first round, which is a pretty good deal for me. I'll accept Bob's offer. 

{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}"
