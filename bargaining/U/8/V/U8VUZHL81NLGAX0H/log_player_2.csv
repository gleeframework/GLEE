Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 950000,
""alice_gain"": 50000,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's be reasonable. I'll take 900,000 and leave you with 100,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair compromise.  Remember, inflation is hurting both of us. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is still a heavily skewed offer in Alice's favor. While it's getting better, waiting her out is the optimal strategy as long as she's moving in the right direction."

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm still willing to be fair, but you need to be reasonable.  I'll take 800,000, leaving you with 200,000.  Let's end this now, before inflation eats away at everything. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure and moving in the right direction.  While inflation is a factor, holding out for one more round to see if she'll offer a more equitable split is worth the risk."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's time to stop playing games. I'm offering you 300,000 - a very generous offer considering the time we've wasted. Take it or leave it, because this is my final offer.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's time to be reasonable. I'm offering you 300,000, which is more than you're getting now.  Inflation is hurting us both, and it's time to reach a compromise.  Let's end this now, before things get worse. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice has called my bluff and matched my previous offer. Accepting now is the best course of action. While not ideal, it prevents further losses from inflation and secures a reasonable sum."
