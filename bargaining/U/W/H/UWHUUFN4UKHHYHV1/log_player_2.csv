"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent chunk. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Since the money doesn't lose value for me (Bob) and loses 10% of its value for Alice with each round, I have an advantage in delaying the agreement. Alice's initial offer gives me only 10% of the total amount, which seems too low considering the advantage I have due to the inflation rules. By rejecting this offer, I'm hoping to either get a better offer in subsequent rounds or benefit from Alice's growing urgency to settle as the value of her potential share decreases."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nSince I rejected Alice's offer, now it's my turn to make a proposal. Given the rules of inflation, where the money loses no value for me but 10% of its value for Alice with each round, I'll try to make an offer that seems somewhat fair but still takes advantage of my position. I'll offer Alice a bit more than what she offered me in terms of percentage, but still aim to come out on top considering the rounds ahead will devalue her share further.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is more than fair.""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer gives Alice 40% of the total, which is more than the 10% she initially offered me, but still leans in my favor considering the inflation advantage. The message aims to subtly remind Alice of the inflation aspect without being too aggressive, hoping she'll consider the devaluing of her share over time and might be more inclined to accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it down the middle. I'm not happy with the inflation, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Although Alice's offer seems fair at first glance by splitting the money down the middle, I must consider the inflation factor and the rounds left. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Alice, I'm in a stronger negotiating position. By accepting this offer, I'd be giving up the potential to gain more in subsequent rounds as Alice's share continues to devalue. Given that we're only in Round 3 out of 12, I believe there's room for further negotiation that could result in a more favorable outcome for me. Rejecting this offer puts pressure on Alice, who knows the value of her potential share decreases with each round, possibly leading to a better offer in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","Given the current state of the game and the impact of inflation on Alice's share, I'll adjust my offer to slightly favor her more than my previous offer but still aim to benefit from the situation. Since Alice's last offer was to split the money equally, I'll propose a division that gives her slightly less than half, acknowledging the compromise she's willing to make while also considering the decreasing value of her share over time.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering your compromise, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle, but keep in mind the value of your share over time.""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer aims to appear as a concession from my previous stance, acknowledging Alice's willingness to compromise with a 50/50 split. By giving her slightly less than half, I'm maintaining a favorable position while also showing flexibility in the negotiation. The message is designed to remind Alice of the ongoing impact of inflation on her share, subtly suggesting that accepting this offer might be more beneficial than waiting for further rounds where her potential gain could decrease in value even more."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than this. Inflation is really affecting me. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nReasoning: Despite Alice's willingness to compromise and her acknowledgment of the inflation's impact on her share, I still believe there's room for a more favorable outcome for me. Given that we're only halfway through the rounds and the value of Alice's share continues to decrease significantly (now worth 34.39% less than in the first round), I'm inclined to push for a better deal. The fact that Alice states she can't go lower than this offer might be a negotiation tactic, and rejecting this offer tests her resolve while also keeping the pressure on her due to the ongoing inflation. By rejecting, I maintain the possibility of achieving a more advantageous division in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","As the game progresses and Alice's share continues to devalue due to inflation, I'll make an offer that seems to take into account her concerns but still leverages my advantageous position. Given that Alice's last offer gave me 45% of the total, I'll propose a division that slightly increases her share from my previous offer, making it seem like a compromise while still favoring me due to the inflation factor.\n\n{""bob_gain"": 5250, ""alice_gain"": 4750, ""message"": ""I see you're feeling the pinch of inflation. This is as close to meeting you halfway as I'm comfortable with, considering the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nThis offer aims to appear as a concession from my previous stance, acknowledging the impact of inflation on Alice's share and her growing urgency. By giving her a bit more than in my last offer but still less than what she proposed, I'm maintaining pressure on her to accept while also showing some flexibility in the negotiation. The message is designed to empathize with her situation while also making it clear that I'm aware of my advantageous position, hoping to nudge her towards accepting this offer rather than risking further devaluation in subsequent rounds."
