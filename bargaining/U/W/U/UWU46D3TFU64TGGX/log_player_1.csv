"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, seems fair""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's still fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, my gain of 6000 in the first round is now worth 4800 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept a smaller share of 3000, which is worth 2400 in the current round. This is still a decent offer, but I was hoping for a bit more.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
