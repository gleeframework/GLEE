{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, with each of us getting $500,000. This is a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept it."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled with the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my thinking. If I accept this offer, I'll get $300,000, which is worth 80% of the original $375,000 (since 20% was lost due to inflation).

I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential gains I could get in future rounds. Considering Bob's message, it seems like he's trying to get a good deal, but not giving up too much.
