"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I'm the one making the first move. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a fairer split, considering I have to wait another round to get my share.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my gain of $45 is actually worth 95% of $60, which is $57.

I'm not thrilled with the 55/45 split, but I'm willing to accept it since it's a relatively small concession and I don't want to risk waiting another round and losing more value due to inflation.

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
