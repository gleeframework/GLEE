Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go higher, but I think we need to compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly now. While her offer is closer to a typical ""ultimatum game"" split, I believe she might be willing to concede further to avoid losing everything. I'll hold out a bit longer to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out! I'm sticking with my offer.  It's a good deal, and we should wrap this up before inflation eats away at your gains.""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing the pressure on Alice.  She's more aware of the shrinking pot with each round. This offer, while heavily favoring me, might be tempting enough for her to accept to avoid losing even more value."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand we're both trying to get the best deal, but we need to reach a compromise soon. I'm willing to go higher, but this is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting desperate, but this is the first time her offer has dipped below a 60/40 split in her favor.  While I was holding out for a better deal, the risk of walking away with nothing is starting to outweigh the potential for higher gains. It's time to take the sure thing before Alice potentially lowers her offer further or we both lose out."
