"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a split that gives me a large majority, but still leaves Bob with something. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation and potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor. This is still a significant amount of money for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I hope Bob sees that and accepts this offer to avoid further rounds and potential losses due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would still prefer a larger share, the value of the money is rapidly decreasing. Accepting this offer ensures I still get a substantial amount, even though it's less than I initially wanted."
