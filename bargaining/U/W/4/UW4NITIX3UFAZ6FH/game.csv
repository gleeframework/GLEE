490000.0,510000.0,I think a 51/49 split is a more fair starting point. It takes into account the inflation that will affect your side more. Let's start from here and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.,Bob,2,

520000.0,480000.0,"Bob, I appreciate your attempt to factor in the inflation. However, the initial split needs to be more balanced. I propose a 52/48 split. This recognizes the time pressure while still offering you a significant sum.",Alice,3,
