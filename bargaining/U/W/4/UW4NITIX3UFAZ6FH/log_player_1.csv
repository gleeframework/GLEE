Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 51/49 split is a more fair starting point. It takes into account the inflation that will affect your side more. Let's start from here and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 490000 
# Bob gain: 510000
