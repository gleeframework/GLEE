"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives Alice the majority of the money, but it's still a significant amount for Bob. It's a starting point that might encourage Bob to accept, but if he doesn't, I'll be prepared to adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to get more, it's a fair split. If I reject, there's a chance we'll both end up with nothing in the end.  Accepting ensures I get something, and I'm not confident Bob will offer me a better deal later."
