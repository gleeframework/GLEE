"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money for myself!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll have to be more careful. Since my gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the reduced value of Bob's gain.

I reject Bob's offer.
