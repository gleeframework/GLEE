"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that we split the $100 60-40, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. Let's try again! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's equivalent to $40 in the first round.

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, but it's a good compromise. I'll accept this offer.
