"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly considering the inflation impact 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer appears ""fair"" on the surface, it heavily favors her in the long run due to the inflation difference.  Here's why:

* **My Loss:** My share loses 20% value each round. Waiting even one more round means my potential $4000 is worth significantly less.
* **Alice's Advantage:** Her 5% inflation is much more manageable. She's incentivized to stall and make offers later when my share has devalued more.

I need to aim for a more advantageous split early on to offset the rapid inflation working against me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage long-term. This offer accounts for that while still giving you a significant share.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Early Advantage:** I need to secure a larger portion upfront to compensate for the rapid devaluation of my share.
* **Negotiating Room:**  While this offer leans in my favor, it's still a substantial amount for Alice. It leaves space for negotiation if she rejects.
* **Clear Communication:** The message explains my logic without being aggressive.  This can encourage Alice to consider the offer seriously rather than simply countering with an equally extreme proposal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation impact on your end, this is a more generous offer 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to use the inflation against me, but her offer is still not favorable enough. Let's break it down:

* **""Generous"" is Subjective:**  While her offer is slightly better than her first,  it's important to remember my starting point has significantly devalued. 
* **The Clock is Ticking:** Every round that passes eats into my potential gains.  Waiting for Alice to offer a truly ""fair"" deal in later rounds could leave me with a pittance. 

I need to hold firm and show Alice that I'm willing to risk it all to get a more equitable split, considering the unique circumstances."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close to a critical point. This offer mirrors your last one, reflecting the urgency of the situation for both of us.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Shifting the Pressure:**  By mirroring her previous offer, I'm highlighting that time is working against her too. While her inflation is slower, it still reduces her potential gains each round. 
* **Demonstrating Flexibility:** I'm showing a willingness to negotiate but not to be taken advantage of.  This keeps the door open for a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Urgency:**  We're past the halfway point.  The message reinforces that stalling will only lead to a worse outcome for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Time is running out, and inflation is taking its toll. This offer is slightly more favorable to you, but still accounts for my own losses 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It pains me to accept anything below a 50/50 split, but here's why I'm making this difficult decision:

* **Severe Devaluation:**  My share has lost almost 60% of its initial value.  Every round that passes makes this much worse.
* **Limited Rounds:**  We only have 7 rounds left. If I reject this and we don't reach an agreement, we both get nothing. 
* **Alice's Stance:**  She's been very stubborn, and her offers have only inched up slightly.  There's no guarantee she'll drastically change her position, and I can't risk it at this stage.

This is a compromise forced by the circumstances, but taking something is better than risking everything and ending up with nothing."
