Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of inflation more than Bob, and her offers are getting progressively worse for her. While her offer isn't terrible, Bob can likely push for a slightly better deal in the next round or two as the shrinking pot incentivizes Alice to settle."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 570000, ""alice_gain"": 430000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. This offer accounts for the shrinking value and gets us both something substantial before it's too late.""}"

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 73.79% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is killing me, last chance for a fair deal 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The tide is turning. While this offer isn't ideal, it's better than what Alice offered in Round 3 when inflation was less severe for both parties.  Given that inflation is hurting Alice significantly more than Bob, it's unlikely she'll offer a better deal. Waiting longer risks Alice panicking and offering even less favorable terms, or time running out entirely."
