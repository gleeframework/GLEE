I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Bob's offer is a big step down from my initial proposal, and I'm not willing to accept it so quickly. I'll see what I can do in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}

I'll offer Bob a slightly lower share this time, but I'm still hoping to secure a decent amount for myself."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob seems to be getting more and more greedy with each round. I won't accept this offer, I'm still hoping for a better split."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7500, ""bob_gain"": 2500} 
```

I'll try to meet Bob halfway, but I'm still holding firm on getting a larger share.  Let's see if this convinces him."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable. I won't accept this, I'm still aiming for a fairer split."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm willing to compromise a little more to avoid getting nothing.  This is a fair offer, and hopefully, Bob will realize it's better than continuing to risk getting nothing."
