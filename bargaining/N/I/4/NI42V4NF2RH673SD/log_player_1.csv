Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. This offer gives you a good deal considering the money will be worth less with each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  The longer this goes on the less you'll get. Accept this generous offer! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

Here's why I reject Bob's offer:

* **Leverage:** Bob is clearly using time pressure as a tactic. However, he also loses if the game goes to the 12th round. This means we both need to find a compromise.
* **Value:** While the inflation is working against me, accepting $40 now is a significant loss compared to my potential gains in earlier rounds. I need to signal I'm serious about a fairer split.
* **Strategy:** By continuing to reject these offers, I'm hoping Bob will start to feel the pressure and offer a more reasonable deal in the next few rounds."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 50,
""bob_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Bob, this is getting us nowhere. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Let's end this now and both get a decent amount.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  The impact of inflation is becoming more significant. While holding out for a better deal is tempting, the potential losses are increasing rapidly.
* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is objectively fair and removes any argument about who is being greedy. 
* **Urgency:**  Offering an even split emphasizes the need to settle quickly. It signals I'm serious about reaching an agreement before the inflation makes the whole thing pointless."
