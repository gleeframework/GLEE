"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, so we both get $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less now, I'd rather get a larger share to make up for the loss in value. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll aim for a larger share this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, with me getting the larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5800 
# Bob gain: 4200 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I'll have to think strategically about this offer. Since I rejected a 70/30 split in Round 3, I'll consider a 58/42 split this time, which is a bit more balanced. However, I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
