I'm going to reject this offer. It's not entirely fair, and I can do better by proposing my own split in the next round.  Let's see if Alice is willing to be more reasonable."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, considering the inflation hits me harder 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll reject this offer again. Alice is trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in.  I'll make another counter-proposal in the next round."
