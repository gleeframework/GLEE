"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going for a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher share, I don't want to risk getting even less in the next round due to inflation. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least something, even if it's less than my initial proposal."
