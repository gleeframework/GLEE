Let's start fair and even."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with a 5% loss from the previous offer, I'll take my chances with a higher percentage of the remaining money!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'll offer Bob a slightly lower share, as he's already shown a willingness to take less than an even split."
