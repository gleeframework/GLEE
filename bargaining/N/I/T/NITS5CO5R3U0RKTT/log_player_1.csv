"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise""
}
```

I'm offering to take $60 and leave $40 for Bob. I'm framing it as a fair compromise, hoping Bob will accept."
