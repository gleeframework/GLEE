"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I propose to keep $900,000 and give Bob $100,000.  I think this is a fair starting point, as I'm taking a larger share but I'm willing to negotiate in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
 
This seems like a fair split, given the inflation and that Bob is taking a larger share.  It's better than risking getting nothing in later rounds."
