"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair deal.  I'll take 90% and you get 10%. What do you say?

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Your offer was a bit greedy Alice. I'm willing to be fair, but I need a bigger slice.  Let's make a deal where we both benefit.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point. Let's split it 60/40.  This is a good compromise, and we both get a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Taking inflation into account, this is a decent offer for Bob. He gets less than in round 2, but waiting longer is increasingly risky."
