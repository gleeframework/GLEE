"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is fairer. It gives you a good starting point, and I can get a bit more of the money. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll!

I'll think about it... 

I'm not thrilled about the 55-45 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd rather not go to the next round if I can get a decent deal now.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
