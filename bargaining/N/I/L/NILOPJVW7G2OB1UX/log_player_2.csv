""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Your initial offer was a good starting point, but the inflation disparity doesn't justify a 60/40 split in the first round.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split to acknowledge the inflation difference while still reaching a more equitable outcome.""

# Alice gain: 541500
