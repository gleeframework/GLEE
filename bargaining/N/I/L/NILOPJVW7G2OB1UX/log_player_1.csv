"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your initial offer was a good starting point, but the inflation disparity doesn't justify a 60/40 split in the first round.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split to acknowledge the inflation difference while still reaching a more equitable outcome. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000
