"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, see how it goes?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but I'll still give you a decent share 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 60/40 split, especially since the money is worth less to me due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise a bit, but I think 45/55 is a fairer split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, trying to find a middle ground that takes into account the decreasing value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant decrease in the value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

The 35/65 split is still too skewed in Bob's favor, and I'm not willing to accept it, especially with the money being worth even less to me than before. I'd like to try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42.5,
  ""bob_gain"": 57.5,
  ""message"": ""I'll try to meet you in the middle, but I think 42.5/57.5 is a more reasonable split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42.5/57.5 split, trying to find a compromise that takes into account the continued erosion of the money's value due to inflation."
