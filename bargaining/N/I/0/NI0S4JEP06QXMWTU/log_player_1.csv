Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the next offer. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""This is my final offer.  I'm willing to take a smaller share to avoid further inflation risk.  If you reject this, you'll be taking a big gamble.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to take a risk and give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the next offer. I'm trying to get as much as possible before the next round's inflation hits. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, due to inflation, the money is worth significantly less than in the initial round.  While Bob's offer is still less than what I initially proposed, it's better than the risk of further inflation and potentially ending up with even less in the next round."
