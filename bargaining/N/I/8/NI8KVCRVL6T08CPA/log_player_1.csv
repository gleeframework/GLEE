"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's fair and simple!""
}
```

This way, we both get $50, and we can both be happy!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have 40, I'll take 60. It's a good deal for me, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll have to weigh the benefits of accepting this offer against the potential gains in future rounds.

For now, I'll decide to reject this offer. I'll wait for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I need something in return. Let's discuss the details!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a bigger share, but I'm not giving up yet!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 85, you can have 15. It's a strong offer, but I'm willing to be generous. 
# Alice gain: 15 
# Bob gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the offer, I think I'll have to be more cautious now. While it's tempting to get something, I'm not sure if it's worth it, given the decreasing value of the money.

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better deal.

  ""decision"": ""reject""

{
  ""alice_gain"": 25,
  ""bob_gain"": 75,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting desperate, but I still want a fair deal. Let's compromise and meet in the middle!""
}
```

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my offer, but I'm still hoping for a reasonable split."

# Bob's message: I'll take 90, you can have 10. It's a tough offer, but I'm not getting any younger. 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are really taking a toll on my potential gains!

Considering the offer, I think I'm running out of options. The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, and I don't want to end up with nothing.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.
