"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor, with me getting $70 and Bob getting $30. My message to Bob is that I'm starting with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet you in the middle, then we can discuss 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, my gain of $50 is equivalent to $47.50 in the first round.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
