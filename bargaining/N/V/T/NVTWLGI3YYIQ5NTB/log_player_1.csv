"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, with me getting $60 and Bob getting $40. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that. Let's try a slightly more even split.  
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll consider the offer in terms of the actual value I'll receive.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with this offer. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, and I'd like to propose a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me now, I'll adjust my offer accordingly.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 52,
  ""bob_gain"": 48,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering a 52-48 split, with me getting $52 and Bob getting $48. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer!"
