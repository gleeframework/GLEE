"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and give Bob 40%. The message is a friendly one, hoping to get a quick acceptance!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's try a more balanced split. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks he can do better, huh?

Let's see... I'm not sure if I like the fact that Bob is trying to take a bigger share this time around. But I do want to get this game over with, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll decide to accept this offer, hoping that it's the best I can get.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
