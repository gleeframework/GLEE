{""bob_gain"": 5500,

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's just split it evenly this time. It's getting too risky to keep rejecting offers, and I think a 50/50 split is fair considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
