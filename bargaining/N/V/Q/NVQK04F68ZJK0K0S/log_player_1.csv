"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 
 
I'm going to try and secure the majority of the money in this round.  Since the money depreciates more for me than for Bob, I want to get as much as possible early on.  Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  While I'm losing money with each round, I'm still in a better position to negotiate than Bob.  I'll try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to see if I can entice Bob to accept. I still want to get a substantial share of the money, but I recognize that I need to make some concessions. I'm confident that Bob will understand that this is a fair deal, given the depreciation in my gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject this offer. While the depreciation is starting to hurt, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'm going to try and counter with a higher offer for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to find a middle ground. The depreciation is becoming a real factor, but I'm still confident I can secure a decent portion of the money. I'm hoping Bob recognizes that continuing to reject offers will lead to a situation where he gets less in the end."
