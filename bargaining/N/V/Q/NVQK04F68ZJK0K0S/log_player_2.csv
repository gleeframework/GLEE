"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 1 
# Alice gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is ridiculous, Bob should reject it and hope for a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 20 
# Alice gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Alice is still being very greedy. Even with the inflation, the offer is far from fair. Bob should keep rejecting and wait for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30} 
``` 
This offer is more balanced and considers the inflation for Alice. It gives a larger portion to Bob while still acknowledging that Alice's money is worth less."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is the first offer that gives Bob a significant portion of the money and also accounts for Alice's inflation. While Alice still gets a larger share, it's a reasonable offer considering the circumstances. Bob should accept this to avoid further inflation and ensure he receives something."
