"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better offer, but still keep a slight edge 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I'm now considering a lower amount for myself, but I'm not sure if I'm willing to accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now, hoping to negotiate further and get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the further inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, I'll take a bit more, but still leave room for compromise""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, trying to find a middle ground that might be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the continued inflation, my gain is worth even less, and I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again, as I'm not willing to accept a 70/30 split, especially considering the value of money is decreasing. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another offer, taking into account the further inflation.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3600,
  ""bob_gain"": 6400,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you at 36/64, but I'm not going any lower""
}
```

I'm proposing a new split, trying to find a balance that works for both of us, while also being mindful of the decreasing value of money."
