"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 60% and you get 40%. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Although it seems like a fair starting point, this offer heavily favors Alice, especially considering the inflation. It's worth seeing if we can negotiate a better deal in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I understand you wanting a larger share, but let's be realistic. This offer is fair considering the decreasing value over time.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need to get a fair share. Let's split it 55/45. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice is slowly moving towards a more even split, but it's still heavily in her favor considering the faster rate of inflation for me.  It's a risk, but I'll hold out for a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Time is running out, Alice. This offer is a compromise that benefits both of us before inflation eats away at the value.""
