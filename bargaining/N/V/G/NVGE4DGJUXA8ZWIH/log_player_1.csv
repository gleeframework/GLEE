"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This offer gives me $550,000 and leaves Bob with $450,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of $475,000 in this round is equivalent to $475,000 / 0.95 = $500,000 in the first round, which is less than my initial offer of $550,000. I'm not eager to accept a worse deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Here's my proposal for round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 487500,
  ""bob_gain"": 512500
}
```

This offer gives me a slightly larger share, but still leaves a decent amount for Bob."
