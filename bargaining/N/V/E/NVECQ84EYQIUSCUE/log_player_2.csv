**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily decreasing her offer while the value of the money decreases significantly for me with each round. While the pressure is on, accepting now would mean losing out on a significant amount of potential earnings. It's a gamble, but I need to hold out for a better offer."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Okay, let's be real. Inflation is killing us both. 50/50, take it or leave it. This is non-negotiable.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

The pressure is mounting, and inflation is rapidly eroding the value of the potential winnings.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most logical option at this point. It sends a clear message that I'm serious and removes any room for further negotiation, which is crucial given the limited time remaining."
