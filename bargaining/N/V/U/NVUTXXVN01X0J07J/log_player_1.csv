I'm starting with a very small offer to Bob, hoping to secure almost all the money for myself. Since I'm not aware of the inflation rate's impact on Bob, I'm taking a risk, but I believe it's a good strategy to maximize my gains in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would prefer to get more, accepting a 50/50 split is the best option in this scenario. I don't know how the inflation rate will affect me in the future rounds, and risking rejection again could lead to a worse outcome."
