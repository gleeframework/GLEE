It's still too early to accept this offer. While getting closer to a fair split, accepting now would mean losing out on potential gains.  Alice's offers are steadily decreasing, indicating a willingness to negotiate."

Alice is unlikely to offer anything better at this point.  Considering the inflation, taking the offer now is better than risking getting a worse offer later or even ending up with nothing."
