"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. I'll take 80% and you get 20%.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the original $10,000, which is $2,000. I'll take the remaining 80%, which is $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair starting point 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to adjust my expectations due to the inflation.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not getting a good deal. With inflation, the $4,000 I would gain is only worth 80% of what I would have gained in the first round, and the $6,000 Bob would gain is worth 120% of what I would have gained in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation.

Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a smaller share, but I'm hoping you'll see this as a more reasonable offer.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 70% of the remaining $10,000, which is $7,000, and I'll take 30%, which is $3,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, let's split it 50/50 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more even split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. With inflation, the $5,000 I would gain is worth 50% of what I would have gained in the first round, which is a decent deal considering the circumstances."
