"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

This offer is a fair starting point. It gives Bob a slightly larger share, acknowledging that I will be the one making the offer.  I hope Bob accepts, but I'm prepared to negotiate in the following rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is worse for me than the offer I made in the first round, even accounting for the inflation. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
```

I'm offering an even split this round. Given the inflation, and Bob's previous rejection, I believe this is a fair offer.  I hope he accepts, but I am ready to continue negotiating if necessary."
