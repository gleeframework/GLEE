"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I propose I take $70 and you take $30. It's a good deal for you in the first round, Bob! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  It's a decent deal, but I think I can do better by seeing how much Alice is willing to give up as the rounds progress."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm offering you $40 this round, Alice.  I'm sure we can find a more equitable split as we go along.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's try this again. I'll take $75 and you get $25.  Remember, the value decreases fast for you with each round! 
# Bob gain: 25 
# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm still going to reject this offer.  While the value is decreasing faster for me, I think I can hold out for a better deal.  Alice is still offering a significant imbalance, and I believe we can find a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 50,
""alice_gain"": 50,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. I'm offering you a 50/50 split. This way, we both get a decent share of the money, and we don't have to keep rejecting each other's offers. Let's avoid further losses from inflation.""
