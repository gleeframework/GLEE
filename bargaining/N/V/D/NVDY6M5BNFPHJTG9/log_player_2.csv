This is a good starting point.  It's worth seeing what Alice will offer next, especially since her money is depreciating faster."

Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer is still better than the 50/50 split I initially wanted, I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. My money is depreciating faster, and with each passing round, the potential gains decrease. It's better to take what I can get now before things get even worse."
