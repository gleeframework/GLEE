"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 80/20. It's a better deal for both of us than the last round, and the value keeps dropping.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4

{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm offering a 60/40 split. This is the last time I'm compromising. Take it before the money is worth even less for me!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting tired of this game.  Let's split it 70/30 in my favor.  This is my final offer. If you reject it, we both lose more money.  Think about it. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's painful, but at this point, the inflation is eating away at the potential gains too much. Accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision, even if it's heavily skewed in her favor.
