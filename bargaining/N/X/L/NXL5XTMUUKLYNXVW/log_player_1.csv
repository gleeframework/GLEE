"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started with a fair share!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. This way, we're both getting a decent amount to start with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, no need to overthink it! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $50 is actually worth $45 ($50 * 0.9).

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
