"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take less to start.""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the initial $10,000 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but still a decent share for you 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $2000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $1600.

I don't think this is a fair deal, considering I'm only getting a quarter of the original $10,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's too low for me, I'll make a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 64% of its original value now (0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64). So, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3200,
  ""bob_gain"": 6800,
  ""message"": ""A bit more reasonable, considering the value is dropping.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but you'll get a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my potential gain of $1000 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, which is $512.

I don't think this is a good deal, considering I'm only getting a tiny fraction of the original $10,000. I'd like to reject this offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's still too low, I want a bigger share.""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 40.96% of its original value now (0.8 * 0.8 * 0.8 = 0.64 * 0.8 = 0.512, then 0.512 * 0.8 = 0.4096). So, I'll make a new offer that takes this into account.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 2048,
  ""bob_gain"": 7952,
  ""message"": ""Getting closer to a fair split, but I still want a bit more.""
