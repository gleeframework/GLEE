"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, with me taking 60% as I'm the one making the offer this round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer was for him. While inflation is a factor, it's not worth accepting such a lopsided deal this early. I'm hoping Bob will become more reasonable as the rounds progress and the value of the money decreases."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Let's be realistic, Bob. 60/40 in your favor is too much. I'm proposing 55/45. Time is running out and the money's losing value fast.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 55/45 is a good compromise. It's fair given the declining value of the money, and it allows us to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is simply mirroring my previous offer back to me, trying to capitalize on my willingness to compromise.  While the deal is getting closer to an acceptable range, I need to show Bob I'm not desperate yet and won't accept a disadvantageous agreement just because time is passing. The inflation is hurting him more than me right now."
