"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm starting with a straightforward proposal, offering Bob a 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly lower share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, Bob's offer is actually a good deal for me, as my share is still worth the same as in the first round, while Bob's share is worth 5% less.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
