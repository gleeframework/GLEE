"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, hoping he'll accept quickly and we can avoid the inflation penalty. My message is a friendly nudge to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting already!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to be more cautious. I'll reject Bob's offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a compromise, offering Bob a slightly larger share to see if he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want more! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Considering the reduced value, I'll take a closer look at Bob's offer. Since it's not significantly different from my previous offer, and I'm trying to avoid further losses due to inflation, I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
