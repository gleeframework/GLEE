Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Even with inflation, this offer still heavily favors Alice. I'm willing to negotiate, but not if it means getting such a small portion.
