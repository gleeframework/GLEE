I'm getting increasingly concerned about the inflation rate. I'm willing to make a significant concession to reach an agreement, but I need to secure a substantial share to compensate for the diminishing value of my gains."

While this is a much lower share than what I had hoped for initially, I am facing a significant disadvantage due to the inflation rate. At this point, accepting a 50/50 split is the most sensible decision to avoid losing everything."
