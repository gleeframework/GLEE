"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair start""}

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the money and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, considering we're just beginning the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly. It's a good starting point, and we can adjust from there. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I can do better. I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up 50% of the money just yet. I'd like to make a new proposal to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the money and Bob gets 40%. I'm trying to find a compromise that's closer to my original offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
