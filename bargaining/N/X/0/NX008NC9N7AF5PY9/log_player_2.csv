Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I take a bit more to start, but we both get a good deal. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's not waste time. I'll take a little less than my original offer, but it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
It's better to take what's offered than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
