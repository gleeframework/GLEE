Bob's offer:

# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting a bit more aggressive, but I'm willing to meet him halfway.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. It's not the best deal I could have gotten, but it's a fair one, and I don't want to risk going to the 12th round."
