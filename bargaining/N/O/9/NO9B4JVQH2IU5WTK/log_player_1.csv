"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 400,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering we have 12 rounds to negotiate and the value of the money will decrease over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the value of the money has decreased, I need to adjust my strategy. Bob's offer is 50/50, which is a fair split. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll accept this offer.
