This is a fair starting offer, as it splits the money 60/40 in my favor, which reflects the fact that the money will be worth less to Bob in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5400, ""bob_gain"": 4600}
```

This offer reflects the continued inflation, with the money now being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob compared to the first round. I'm still aiming for a 60/40 split, but taking into account the diminishing value of the money, I've adjusted the offer accordingly."
