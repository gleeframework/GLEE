"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take $6,000 and you get $4,000. We can discuss further if you want.""
}

# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a bad offer, but I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```

}
```"
