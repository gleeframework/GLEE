"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose we divide the money with a ratio of 7:3. This might seem a bit lopsided, but consider the risk of inflation. By keeping more of the funds, I aim to secure a larger portion for myself against potential future value loss. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70
