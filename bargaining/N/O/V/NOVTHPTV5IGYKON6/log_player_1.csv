"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the remaining 1,000,000$ in 11 more rounds""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob gets 40%. This way, we can still have a chance to negotiate and adjust the split in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 10% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I don't think I should accept an offer that gives Bob a 70% share, especially when the money is already worth less due to inflation. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me halfway, let's try to find a fair split""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting 42% and Bob getting 58%. I'm trying to be more flexible and find a compromise."
