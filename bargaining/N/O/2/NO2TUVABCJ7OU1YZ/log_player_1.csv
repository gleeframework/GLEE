"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a common and reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's give me a bit more, I'll still be fair 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is getting less valuable by the round.

I'm not too thrilled about the 30-70 split, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
