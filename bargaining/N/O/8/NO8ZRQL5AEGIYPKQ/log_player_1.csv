"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 99, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

I propose taking $99 for myself, and leaving $1 for Bob. This is a very aggressive opening move, but it gives me a large portion of the money before inflation can devalue it.  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid further risk of losing more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly more generous than my first offer. While I'm tempted,  I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better deal. I believe I still have the advantage in this game.  Even though inflation is working against me, I still have more rounds to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm going to lower my offer a bit to 90 for me, 10 for Bob. This is a concession, but I'm still hoping to secure a significant portion of the money. Bob knows that I rejected his generous offer, so he might be more willing to compromise. I'm also trying to avoid pushing him too hard and risking him refusing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

It's time to accept. Bob is being increasingly aggressive with his offers, and with inflation continuing to hurt him, I believe he's more likely to take a larger share in future rounds.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise, ensuring I get at least something before the value of the money drops further."
