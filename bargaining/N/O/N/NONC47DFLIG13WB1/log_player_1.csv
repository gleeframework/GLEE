"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'm willing to give you $400,000.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. The message is a friendly introduction to the game and a proposal for a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you half, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation has already started to take its toll!

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not thrilled about giving up $500,000, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value. I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
