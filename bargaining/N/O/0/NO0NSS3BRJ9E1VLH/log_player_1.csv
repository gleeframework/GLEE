I'm proposing a 90/10 split, hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my share slightly, but I'm still aiming for a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement rather than risking further inflation."
