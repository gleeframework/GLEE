Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair that we both get a decent share. How about 5500 for me and 4500 for you? This way, we both get a good amount, and we don't have to worry about the inflation eating into our gains. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
