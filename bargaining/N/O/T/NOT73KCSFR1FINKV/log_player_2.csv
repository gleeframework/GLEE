"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's divide fairly, I get a bit more 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This is a good starting point. It's a fair offer, but I'm aware of the inflation rate. I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we should split the money more evenly. I'll take a bit more this time, but I'm open to negotiation.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit less, but still more than half. Let's settle 
# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this is a slight improvement for me, the inflation is starting to kick in. I want to see if I can get a better deal, especially with Alice now taking less."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Time is running out, and the money is losing value. Let's compromise and split it closer to 55/45. It's a fair deal for both of us.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll take a bit more, but it's getting urgent. Let's agree 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice is starting to feel the pressure of inflation, and her offer is getting closer to what I think is fair.  Even with the inflation, it's better to accept now than risk getting nothing."
