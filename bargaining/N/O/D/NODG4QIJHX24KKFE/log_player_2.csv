I'm not going to accept such a lopsided offer right away. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to propose a more balanced split. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is still offering a very unequal split. I'll keep rejecting until she offers something fairer.  I'm hoping that inflation will start to have a bigger impact on her offer soon!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000}

I'm going to try an even split this time.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Alice, and we can avoid further rounds of inflation."
