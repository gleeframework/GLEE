"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finish the game!""
}
```

This offer gives me 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think it's fair to split the money more evenly.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth less, so I need to think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is more generous than mine in the first round, I'll consider it. However, I still think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer and let him know I'm looking for an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation adjustment, the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round. My offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm looking for a better deal, but I'll give you a slightly higher share this round. Accept?""
}
```

This offer gives me 60% of the adjusted $100, and Bob gets 40%."
