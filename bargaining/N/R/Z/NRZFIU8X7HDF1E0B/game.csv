550000.0,450000.0,"Let's split fairly, Bob. A little more than half seems like a good starting point, don't you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
450000.0,550000.0,"I think we can be even more fair. How about we split it 55/45, with me taking slightly more this time?",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate the offer, Bob, I think we can strive for a more equitable arrangement. Let's see what the next round brings.",Alice,2,reject
520000.0,480000.0,"Okay, Bob, let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to compromise, but fairness is key for both of us.  How about this split?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
480000.0,520000.0,I understand fairness is important. Let's try a 52/48 split this time. I believe this is a fair compromise and we can both walk away with a decent share.,Bob,4,
,,"This is getting tiresome, Bob.  You're just trying to repackage the previous offer.  I'm willing to be fair, but I'm not going to be taken advantage of.",Alice,4,reject
510000.0,490000.0,"Bob, let's be realistic. We're both losing money with every passing round. I'm proposing a 51/49 split. It's a slight edge for me, but closer to a fair outcome. Take it or let's stop wasting time.",Alice,5,
