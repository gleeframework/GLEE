I'm starting with a very lopsided offer in my favor, hoping Bob will accept it in the first round. This gives me a large portion of the money, and the inflation will likely not affect me too much in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While I would have preferred to get more money, I'm aware of the inflation.  In the next round, my gain would be worth only 80% of what I'm getting now, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal from Bob.  50/50 is a fair split, so I'll take it."
