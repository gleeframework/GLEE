"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and avoid excessive devaluation. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
Let's see if I can get a better deal!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair, considering the inflation we're facing. Let's end this quickly!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split. This is my final offer, let's be reasonable and end this before the inflation hurts you more. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it seems like Alice is standing firm, and further rounds would only hurt me with the increasing inflation. Let's take what I can get."
