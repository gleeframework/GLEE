I'm going to propose a very lopsided split in my favor. I'll take $9000, and Bob gets $1000.  He might accept it since it's the first round, and the inflation is less of a factor right now.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is being greedy! He wants to take almost everything!  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to stick to my strategy of taking a larger share. I'm going to lower my offer slightly to $8000, but I'll still give Bob $2000. I think this might be enough to tempt him. The inflation is starting to kick in, and he might be willing to settle for less. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too lopsided! Even though inflation has hit, it's not worth settling for so little. I'm going to reject his offer and hope we can reach a more equitable agreement in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $7000, but I'll increase Bob's share to $3000.  The inflation is starting to really affect the value of the money, so I need to be more flexible. I think this offer will be tempting enough for him to accept. Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still being stubborn!  The inflation is really starting to hurt now, but I can't let him take advantage of that.  I'm going to reject his offer and hope we can find a middle ground in the next few rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This is getting tense!  We're halfway through the rounds, and the inflation is really starting to bite.  I'm going to lower my share to $6000, which means Bob gets $4000.  It's a significant increase for him, but I think he might finally realize it's better to accept something than risk getting nothing.  Let's see if this is enough to finally end the game."
