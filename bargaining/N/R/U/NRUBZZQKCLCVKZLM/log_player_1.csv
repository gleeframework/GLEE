"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get started! I'll give you a fair share, now it's your turn.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're starting high, I'll meet you in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth 5% less, I need to consider this when evaluating the offer.

In this case, I'll consider the effective values as follows:

* My gain: 4000 (same as before)
* Bob's gain: 5700 (6000 / 0.95)

With this in mind, I'll reject Bob's offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was 6000, and my gain was 4000, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll offer a slight increase in Bob's share, but still keep a larger share for myself.

Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you halfway, but I think I deserve a bit more.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the effective values:

* My gain: 4500 (same as before)
* Bob's gain: 4695 (5500 / 0.856)

Since Bob's gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round, I need to consider this when evaluating the offer.

In this case, I'll reject Bob's offer, as I think I can do better.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 4 was 5500, and my gain was 4500, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll offer a slight increase in my share, but still keep a significant share for Bob.

Here's my proposal for Round 5:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, it's only fair.""
}"
