"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, considering the inflation rates.""}

I'm proposing a 60:40 split, which seems reasonable considering the inflation rates. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly.  We can both get more if we work together! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that splitting it evenly is the best option, considering the inflation rates. I'd like to propose a new offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll wait for Bob's next proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation rates, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is still a fair deal considering the inflation rates.""}

I'm trying to take advantage of the fact that the money I gain is worth less due to inflation, while keeping a slightly larger share for myself."
