"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, and leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less with each round, I'd better take what I can get. I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
