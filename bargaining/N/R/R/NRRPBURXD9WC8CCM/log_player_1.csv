"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split in my favor, with me getting $8,000 and Bob getting $2,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob's perception of the value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm not sure how much less it's worth to Bob. I'll have to be cautious.

I'll reject this offer. The 50/50 split seems reasonable, but I'd like to get a better deal considering the decreasing value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money worth 5% less than in round 2, and considering Bob's previous offer was 50/50, I'll try to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You wanted 50/50, but I think I can do better than that. This way, I get a bit more, but it's still a fair deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve more. This is my best offer so far. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth less and less, and Bob's offer is getting more favorable to him. I'll have to think carefully about this.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think Bob's offer is a bit more reasonable than my previous offer. I'll accept this offer, hoping that I can get a better deal in future rounds.
