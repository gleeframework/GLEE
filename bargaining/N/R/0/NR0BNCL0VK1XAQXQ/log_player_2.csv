"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair and split it 60/40. I think I deserve a bit more since I'm making the first offer. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Your split isn't accounting for the rapid inflation. I'm proposing a more time-sensitive split that still gives you a slight advantage.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my initial offer was generous. I'll meet you halfway between my first offer and your counteroffer. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor considering the rapid depreciation of the money for both of us. We need to push for a more significant shift in our favor before time runs out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and this money is practically evaporating. My offer reflects the urgency of reaching an agreement while acknowledging your initial proposal."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This offer is a significant move towards a more even split. While it favors me slightly, it's crucial to highlight the urgency of the situation due to the rapid inflation. Hopefully, this will incentivize Alice to accept a deal before we both lose out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the urgency, but I won't accept an offer that gives you more than half. My new offer still gives me an advantage, but less than before. Let's settle this. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is finally acknowledging the impact of inflation, but her offer is still not acceptable. While she claims she won't accept less than half, the reality is the value of her ""half"" is decreasing far slower than mine. We need to push her further. Accepting now would reward her stubbornness."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is more than generous considering the circumstances.  Let's be realistic and end this before we're both left with nothing."" 
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This is a calculated risk.  We're pushing our advantage, knowing Alice is stubborn about getting more than half. However, by now, she should clearly understand that ""half"" is a rapidly shrinking concept.  The strong message is designed to emphasize the urgency and absurdity of continuing without a deal.  We're at a point where even a slightly unfavorable deal is better than nothing."
