580000.0,420000.0,"Considering the inflation, my initial offer was generous. I'll meet you halfway between my first offer and your counteroffer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time, and this money is practically evaporating. My offer reflects the urgency of reaching an agreement while acknowledging your initial proposal.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I understand the urgency, but I won't accept an offer that gives you more than half. My new offer still gives me an advantage, but less than before. Let's settle this.",Alice,5,

350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is more than generous considering the circumstances.  Let's be realistic and end this before we're both left with nothing.",Bob,6,
