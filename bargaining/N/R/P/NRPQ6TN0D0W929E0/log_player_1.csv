"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the reminder about the inflation.

I don't think I'm being too generous, and I'm not happy with the 20-80 split. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer is now worth less than before. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, no need for extremes.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair given the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too cautious, I'll take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not comfortable with the 10-90 split. It's getting too skewed towards Bob's favor, and the value of my gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The value of the money is decreasing rapidly, so I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but not that much!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 40-60 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob, but I'm still trying to get a decent share of the remaining value."
