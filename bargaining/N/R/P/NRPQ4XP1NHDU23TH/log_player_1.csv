"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it. This way, I can avoid the risk of inflation eating away at my potential gains in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, accepting this offer ensures I get at least half of the money and avoids further risk from inflation."
