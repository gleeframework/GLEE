"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm hoping Bob will want to negotiate to get a better deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","That's a very lopsided offer! I'm not interested in accepting an offer that leaves me with such a small share. I'll reject it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","In round 3, I'll try to make a more balanced offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}

This offer is a bit more in my favor, but still leaves Bob with a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another lopsided offer from Bob! I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with such a small share. I'll reject it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, since Bob has been making offers that are quite skewed in his favor:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}

This offer is more in my favor, but still leaves Bob with a decent share. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","This offer is even more one-sided than before! I'm not willing to accept an offer that leaves me with such a tiny share. I'll reject it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I think it's time to make a strong offer. I'll aim for a more balanced split, but with a slight bias towards myself:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}

This offer should give me a decent advantage, but still leaves Bob with a significant share. Let's see if he'll accept this time!"
