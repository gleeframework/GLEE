"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""I think we can find a more balanced solution. How about this?""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  Inflation is hitting Alice harder than Bob.  It's in Bob's best interest to make a deal sooner rather than later. Alice knows this and might be inclined to accept a slightly less favorable deal now.
* **Fairness with Urgency:** Bob's offer is a bit more in his favor than a 50/50 split, but it's still reasonably close to fair. This could make it more appealing to Alice, especially considering the time pressure.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed as a question, suggesting Bob is open to further discussion and potential adjustments in the next round if Alice rejects."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Impact:** Inflation is starting to significantly erode the value of the money.  Accepting $4,200 now is better than risking a worse offer in later rounds where the value will be further diminished. 
* **Alice's Position Weakening:** Alice's offer is better than her first but still favors her.  However, she's feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly, meaning her negotiating position is weakening. It's unlikely she'll offer significantly better terms in future rounds.
* **Avoiding a Losing Scenario:** If Bob rejects this offer, he risks Alice becoming more desperate and potentially offering an even worse deal, or the game continuing to a point where inflation eats away at the potential gains for both players."
