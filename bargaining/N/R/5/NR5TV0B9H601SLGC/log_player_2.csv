Let's see what Alice offers next."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. This offer is fair, and we can avoid any further losses due to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. My last offer is still on the table -  take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
It's better to take what I can get now. I've lost a lot to inflation already, and I don't want to risk losing more."
