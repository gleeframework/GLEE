"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take 70% and you take 30%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70-30 split, giving me the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering the inflation factor. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation factor, I think a 60/40 split is indeed more fair. I'll accept Bob's offer.
