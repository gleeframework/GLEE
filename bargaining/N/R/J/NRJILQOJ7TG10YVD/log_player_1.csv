"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to give Bob $40, and I'll take $60 for myself. This is a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, especially since the money is worth less now due to inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll make my own proposal for Round 3!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

I'm offering to give Bob $45, and I'll take $55 for myself. I'm trying to be a bit more generous this time around, while still getting a slightly better deal than the 50-50 split."
