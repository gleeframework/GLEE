"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a decent share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous share, and keeping $60 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the potential for inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, the actual values are:

* My gain: $40 * 0.9 = $36
* Bob's gain: $60 * 0.8 = $48

I'm not sure I like the 60/40 split, considering the inflation effect. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and make a counteroffer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to counteroffer, can we try 50/50?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the inflation effect:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slight edge, but I'm still looking for a good deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $55, which is a bit more than the $48 he was offering me in the previous round."
