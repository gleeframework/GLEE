"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the original $1,000,000, which is $600,000, and leaving $400,000 for Bob. My message is a friendly one, hoping to set a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You rejected my share, now it's my turn to be fair but strict 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, my gain of $300,000 is actually worth $270,000 (since 90% of $300,000 is $270,000).

I'm not impressed with Bob's offer, as it's still quite skewed in his favor. I'd like to make a counteroffer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still too generous for you, I'd like to counter with a new proposal""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. My previous gain of $270,000 is now worth 90% of that, which is $243,000.

Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meeting you halfway, let's find a mutually beneficial split""
}
```

I'm offering to take $550,000, which is worth $490,500 in the original currency, and leaving $450,000 for Bob. My message is a conciliatory one, hoping to find a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I want a bit more control over the purse strings 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, my gain of $450,000 is actually worth $327,900 (since 72.9% of $450,000 is $327,900).

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer, as it's still quite close to his original offer in Round 2, and I feel I'm not getting enough value for my share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is still a bit too skewed in your favor, I'd like to try to negotiate further""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 27.1% less due to inflation, my previous gain of $327,900 is now worth 72.9% of that, which is $238,313.41 (approximately).

Here's my new proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to take $480,000, which is worth $344,832 (approximately), and leaving $520,000 for Bob. My message is a conciliatory one, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting close, but I'm not budging on the majority share 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 40.95% less due to inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $237,600 (since 59.05% of $400,000 is $237,600).

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, as it's still a significant majority share in his favor, and I feel I'm not getting a fair deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not comfortable with such a large disparity, I'd like to try to negotiate further""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40.95% less due to inflation, my previous gain of $237,600 is now worth 59.05% of that, which is $140,313.52 (approximately).

Here's my new proposal for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
 ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, a 50/50 split seems fair""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which I think is a fair and reasonable compromise. My message is a friendly one, hoping to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
