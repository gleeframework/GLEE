"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get a decent amount, but I'm still willing to give Bob a fair share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I don't like this offer as much as I liked my original one, but I'll consider it. I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer now that I know Bob's minimum acceptable amount. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50-50 split, but I'm willing to compromise a bit to get a better deal than Bob's previous offer."
