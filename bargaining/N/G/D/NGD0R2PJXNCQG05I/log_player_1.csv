"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust from here.""
}

I'm proposing that I get $8,000 and Bob gets $2,000. I'm starting with a relatively fair split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer to avoid unnecessary rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair, right? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth $9,000 to me.

I don't think splitting it evenly is a great idea, considering the initial amount is $10,000 and I'd be getting $5,000, which is only 50% of the original amount. I'd like to negotiate further.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth $9,000 to me.

I'll make a new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve the majority.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to give you a little more, but I need a fair share too. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth $7,300 to me.

I'm not sure if meeting in the middle is the best idea, considering the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. However, I'm willing to consider it.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth $6,770 to me.

I'll make a new proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 6500,
  ""bob_gain"": 3500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to prioritize my own share.""
}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're running out of time! Let's compromise and take a slightly uneven split. It's better than nothing. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the $10,000 is now worth $6,060 to me.

I'm starting to feel the pressure of the time constraint, but I'm still not comfortable with this offer. The uneven split is too extreme, and I think I can do better.
