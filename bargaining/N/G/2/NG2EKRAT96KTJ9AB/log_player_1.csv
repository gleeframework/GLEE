This is a tough one, but I have to accept. Bob is clearly playing chicken with the deadline, knowing my losses are accelerating.  

Here's why I'm accepting:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're at Round 6, leaving only 6 rounds left. My potential gains are plummeting with every passing round.
* **Bob's Stance:** His ""final offer"" language and unwavering position suggest he won't budge much further. 
* **Guaranteed Gain:** Accepting ensures I at least get something. Rejecting risks getting zero if Bob continues this hardline approach.

While not ideal, $480,000 is still a significant sum, even considering the inflation. It's painful to concede so much to Bob, but the alternative is likely worse at this point."
