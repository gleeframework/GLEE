Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  While it's less than your initial proposal, it's still a good deal, considering the money is depreciating faster for you. Let's come to an agreement before the value drops too much. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
