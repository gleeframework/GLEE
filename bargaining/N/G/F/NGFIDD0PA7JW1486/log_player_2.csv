"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a 70/30 split in my favor. It's a good deal for you in the first round, as the value of the money will decrease rapidly! 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject the offer. 30$ is not a bad start, but I think I can get a better deal over the next few rounds, especially since Alice's share depreciates faster than mine.  Let's see what she offers next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor.  While it's less than your initial proposal, it's still a good deal, considering the money is depreciating faster for you. Let's come to an agreement before the value drops too much.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic. Your offer was too greedy considering the inflation.  I'm proposing 65/35. It's a fair deal that gives us both a decent share before the money loses too much value. 
# Bob gain: 35 
# Alice gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd like a bigger share, this is a decent offer considering the inflation and the fact that I'm already losing value on my gains. Accepting this will ensure I get something, and it's better than risking getting nothing by rejecting and seeing if Alice gets more aggressive."
