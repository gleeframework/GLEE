"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a simple proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since Bob's offer is closer to my original proposal, and the money is worth less for both of us, I'll decide to accept this offer.
