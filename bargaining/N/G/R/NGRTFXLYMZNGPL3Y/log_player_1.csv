I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the inflation disadvantage I'll face in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I propose a 45/55 split in favor of Bob.  This is a significant concession from my previous offer, reflecting the increasing inflation. However, I believe this is still a reasonable split that acknowledges Bob's advantage in the inflation rate."

# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 40, ""bob_gain"": 60}
```

I'm proposing a 40/60 split in favor of Bob. This reflects the significant inflation impact on me, but I believe it's still a fair compromise given our current situation. We're getting close to the deadline, and we both need to be realistic about the potential for a more even split."
