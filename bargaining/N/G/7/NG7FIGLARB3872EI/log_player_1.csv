"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and it's a good chunk of money for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $70 is now worth less than my initial proposal of $80. Bob's gain of $30 is also less than his initial proposal of $20, but it's still a decent amount.

I'll consider this offer and decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Considering the inflation has been going on for two rounds, my offer will be even lower than before. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 65,
  ""bob_gain"": 35
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 65% of the $100, which is a slightly higher percentage than Bob's previous offer, but still a reasonable compromise considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll! With my gain being worth 14.26% less than the original $80, my proposal of $60 is actually a decent compromise. Considering Bob's gain of $40 is also significantly lower than his initial proposal of $20, I think this is a reasonable offer.

I'll decide to:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
