 I'll start by offering a large portion of the money to myself, as I know the money loses value faster for Bob.  Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'll reject this offer. Even though Bob's offer is much better than mine,  I know the money loses value for him much faster, and I can likely get a better deal in future rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

I'm going to try to get a little more money for myself. I'll offer Bob 100,000, but I'll keep the majority of the money for myself. It's still a good deal for him, since the money is losing value for him much faster."
