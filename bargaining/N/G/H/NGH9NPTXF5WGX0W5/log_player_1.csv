"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob thinks I was too generous, huh?

I'll have to think carefully about this new offer. Considering the inflation, I'd be getting 95% of the original amount, but it's still a significant reduction from my initial proposal.

I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer, taking into account the inflation and trying to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for inflation""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more in my favor, but still a reasonable offer. Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll take this offer 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of my desperation!

Considering the inflation, I'd be getting only 14.26% of the original amount, which is a significant reduction from my initial proposal. I'm not sure if it's worth accepting.

However, I don't want to risk waiting for another round, as the value of the money will continue to decrease.

I'll accept this offer, hoping it's the best I can get.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
