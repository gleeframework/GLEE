Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer was too greedy. I'm being fair, but the clock is ticking. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out for both of us. I'm proposing a 55/45 split - my final offer.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous. I'm taking a hit on my last offer.  Take it before the deal gets worse for you! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most rational choice. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Every round that passes erodes Bob's potential gains due to inflation. Waiting any longer means accepting even less.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows Bob is losing value and is unlikely to offer significantly more than this.  
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** While not ideal, $350,000 is still a significant sum. Rejecting this offer risks getting an even worse deal or being left with nothing if no agreement is reached. 
 
It's a classic example of game theory where the fear of losing everything often outweighs the desire for a slightly larger share."
