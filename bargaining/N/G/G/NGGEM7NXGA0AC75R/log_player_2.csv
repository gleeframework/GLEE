# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 5% decrease in value for me is less than the 10% decrease for Alice, so I have some leverage to negotiate. Let's see what happens next!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us. Since the value decreases faster for Alice, I'll try to find a balance that benefits me a bit more.
