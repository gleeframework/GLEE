"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose a fair split, but I'm open to negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'm not accepting this offer as it doesn't seem like a fair split to me. I'm willing to negotiate for a more equal division."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle for a fair share.""}\n\n###\nI'm proposing an equal split, which I believe is the fairest way to divide the $100. It gives both of us an equal share without either party feeling taken advantage of."
