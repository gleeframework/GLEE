"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 70/30.  We're both getting closer to a deal, and there's no need to risk the money disappearing. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor. Since the inflation only significantly impacts her, we can maintain a strong position and aim for a more equitable split."
