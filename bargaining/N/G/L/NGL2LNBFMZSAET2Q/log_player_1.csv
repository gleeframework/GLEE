Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

 I propose a 60/40 split, keeping 6000 for myself and giving 4000 to Bob.  This seems like a fair starting point, considering we both lose value with each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair deal for me, as I will receive $5000, which is less than my initial proposal but more than my initial offer would have been worth after inflation. Accepting this ensures I get something, and I don't want to risk Bob rejecting my next offer due to the increasing inflation."
