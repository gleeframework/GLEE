"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This gives me a good starting point, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is unhappy with the offer.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me than my initial proposal, even with the inflation factored in.  I'm not going to accept this.  I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to counter with a 70/30 split in my favor. This is a better offer for Bob than his last proposal and still leaves me with a significant portion of the money.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although inflation has hit me hard, Bob's offer of a 50/50 split is the best I can realistically expect at this point.  Accepting means I get to walk away with something, and I'm not sure I can do better if I reject and try again."
