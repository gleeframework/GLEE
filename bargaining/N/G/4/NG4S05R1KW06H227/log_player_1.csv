"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, no need to negotiate too much!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to see if Bob is willing to accept a fair and simple division of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but you can still do better! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Considering the inflation, $4000 is now worth 90% of $4500, which is a decent offer, but I can still do better. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money due to inflation. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving away too much!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, but still trying to keep a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal, but don't expect me to give away the farm! 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the decreasing value of money, Bob's offer of $3500 is now worth about 73% of $4500, which is a relatively small amount. I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another proposal, taking into account the ongoing inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3800,
  ""bob_gain"": 6200,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while!""
}
```

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split, trying to get a bit more for myself while still leaving Bob with a substantial amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my target, but I'll still give you a chance to catch up! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money's value decreasing rapidly due to inflation, $3000 is now worth a relatively small amount. I'll try to get a better deal, but I'm getting close to the deadline. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another proposal, trying to get a better deal before the value of the money decreases further. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm running out of time, but I'm willing to meet you halfway!""
}
```

I'm proposing a split that's similar to my previous offer, but with a slight adjustment to try to get a better deal."
