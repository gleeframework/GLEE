"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can negotiate from here!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, and I'll take the remaining 60%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering I get to make the first proposal this round.  Let's get this done. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less after the first round, the actual amounts are:

Alice gain: 4800
Bob gain: 7200

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a fair split and I'd rather end the game now than risk getting a worse deal in future rounds. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
