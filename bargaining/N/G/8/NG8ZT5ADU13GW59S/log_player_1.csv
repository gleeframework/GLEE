"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, and we can adjust in future rounds if needed.""}

I'm proposing that I receive $8,000 and Bob receives $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more balanced split is fair, given the value of the money decreases with each round.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the imbalance in Bob's proposal, but I'll consider it.

After calculating the actual value of the money, I realize that the offer is not as bad as it seems. With the 10% decrease in value, my $4,500 would be equivalent to $4,050 in the first round, and Bob's $5,500 would be equivalent to $5,225.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
