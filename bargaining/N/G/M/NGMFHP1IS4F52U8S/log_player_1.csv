"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take this generous offer and we can call it a day!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but it's a fair starting point. If he accepts, I'll get 90% of the initial $1,000,000, and he'll get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! This is a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my strategy.

I'm not convinced that meeting in the middle is the best idea, especially since the money is worth less. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation continuing, the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round. I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, Bob! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a smaller share, hoping he'll be willing to accept it to avoid a worse deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I want a slightly bigger share. This is my last offer. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the money's value. With the money being worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be cautious.

Bob's offer seems reasonable, considering the circumstances. I'm not sure if I can do better in the next round, and Bob's message suggests this is his last offer. I'll accept this offer to avoid a potentially worse deal in the next round.
