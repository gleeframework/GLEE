"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the initial $10,000, and Bob will get 20%. I'm framing it as a fair starting point, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'll take a slightly bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob wants to meet in the middle, but with a slight bias towards himself. Considering the inflation rate, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to consider the long-term implications. If I accept this offer, I'll get $4,000 now, but the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds due to inflation. On the other hand, if I reject this offer, I might get a better deal in future rounds.

I'll decide to reject this offer for now and see what Bob comes up with in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, and we can end this soon!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to meet Bob in the middle, but with a slight bias towards myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finally divide the money."
