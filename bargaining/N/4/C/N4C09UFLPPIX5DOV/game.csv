4000.0,6000.0,"Your offer was a bit lopsided, Alice. Let's be fairer - I take 60%, you take 40%. This accounts for inflation working against me.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5500.0,4500.0,"Let's compromise. I'm willing to take a smaller share now, 55/45 split seems reasonable.  This considers inflation and gives us both a better outcome than your last offer.",Alice,3,
