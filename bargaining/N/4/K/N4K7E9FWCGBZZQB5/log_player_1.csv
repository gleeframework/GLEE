"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, 4:1 in my favor. Accept and we can end this!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split in my favor, which is a generous offer considering the game's inflation mechanics."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more. Your turn to counter! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my gain of 40 is actually worth 32 (80% of 40) in the current round. I'd rather not accept this offer, as I'd like to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3

  ""bob_gain"": 52,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 48:52. It's a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bigger share. You're getting a better deal than you think! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since my gain is worth 48.8% less than the initial amount, my gain of 30 is actually worth 15.84 (30 * 0.528) in the current round.
