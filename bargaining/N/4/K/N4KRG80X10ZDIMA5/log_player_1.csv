"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering a division of $55 for myself and $45 for Bob, with a message that suggests we should aim for a fair split. Since the money doesn't lose value for me but does for Bob, I'm slightly favoring myself in this initial offer, anticipating that Bob might be inclined to accept a deal sooner rather than later due to the devaluing of his potential gain over time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn to propose a fair split. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nSince the money doesn't lose value for me, I have no immediate pressure to accept Bob's offer, which gives me less than my initial proposal. Given that Bob's potential gain decreases with each round due to inflation, I can afford to wait and see if Bob becomes more inclined to accept a division more favorable to me in subsequent rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Consider the future value""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my proposed gain to $58, while decreasing Bob's share to $42. The message ""Consider the future value"" is intended to remind Bob that further delays will only decrease the value of his potential gain due to inflation, hopefully prompting him to accept this offer rather than risking a worse deal in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This offer accounts for the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite Bob's consideration of the decreasing value in his message, his offer still doesn't meet my expectations. Since my potential gain remains unaffected by inflation, I can continue to wait for a better offer. Bob's increasing loss due to inflation with each passing round may eventually lead him to propose a division more favorable to me, or accept one of my future offers. Thus, I choose to reject this offer and proceed to the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting""}\n\n###\n\nWith each round, Bob's potential gain decreases due to inflation, while mine remains constant. In this round, I'm taking a slightly firmer stance by proposing a 60-40 split in my favor. The message ""Inflation is biting"" serves as a reminder to Bob of the continuous devaluation of his potential earnings, aiming to persuade him that accepting this offer might be more beneficial than holding out for a better deal in subsequent rounds, which could result in even less value for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly and end this. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob's offer seems fair at first glance, proposing an even split, it doesn't account for the significant decrease in value his share has undergone due to inflation. Since my potential gain remains unaffected, I'm in a stronger negotiating position. Accepting this offer would mean I'm not leveraging the full advantage of the situation. Thus, I choose to reject this offer, anticipating that Bob's eagerness to end the negotiations, combined with the ongoing devaluation of his share, might lead to a more favorable offer for me in the future."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Patience wears thin""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm increasing my proposed share to $62, while decreasing Bob's share to $38. The message ""Patience wears thin"" is aimed at Bob, hinting that while I'm in no rush due to inflation not affecting my potential gain, his continued rejection of my offers may lead to even less favorable terms in the future. The pressure of inflation, which has now decreased the value of Bob's potential gain significantly, might prompt him to reconsider and accept this offer, realizing that further delays could result in an even worse outcome for him."
