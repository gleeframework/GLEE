"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

Send your offer to divide $100.","{""bob_gain"": 90, ""alice_gain"": 10}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Alice's gain is worth 36% less than in the first round, I can infer that Alice's gain is now worth 64% of the original amount.

In the first round, Alice's gain was 80, so now it's worth 0.64 * 80 = 51.2

Since Alice's offer is 50, which is very close to the value of her gain, I'll accept.
