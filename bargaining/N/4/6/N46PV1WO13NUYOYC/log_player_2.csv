**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing a waiting game, clearly aware that inflation hurts me more than it does her.  While the offer is getting closer to a point where I might be forced to accept, I'm betting she'll get nervous as we get closer to the deadline and offer something more reasonable.  I need to hold out a little longer."
