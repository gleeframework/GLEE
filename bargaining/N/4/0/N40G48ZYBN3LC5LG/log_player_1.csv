"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}

I'm going to propose a division of $90 for myself and $10 for Bob.  This is a very high offer for me, but I figure it's a good starting point. Since inflation will affect the money in the next round, I want to secure as much as possible now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I was initially aiming for. With inflation, I'm losing a substantial amount of value. I'll reject this offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm offering a more even split this time, 60 for me and 40 for Bob. While I'm still aiming for a higher share, I recognize that rejecting Bob's offer may have put me in a weaker position. This offer balances the need to secure some value with the potential for future negotiations."
