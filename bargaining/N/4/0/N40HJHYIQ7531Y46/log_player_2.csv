"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Let's start with a 90/10 split.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 55/45 is a fair split.""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Alice's response.\n\n###\n\n(I'll assume that Alice will respond with an ""accept"" or ""reject"" decision, and if she rejects, she'll send a new offer with a message.)\n\n###\n\nAlso, just to clarify, since we are in Round 2, the total value of the money has decreased by 20% due to inflation, so the new total is $800,000. However, for simplicity, we'll keep using the original amount of $1,000,000 for our proposals. The inflation will be taken into account when the game ends, and the final amounts will be adjusted accordingly."
