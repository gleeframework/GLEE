Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness in the first round. Let's split it more evenly this time, with me taking a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation we both face. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
