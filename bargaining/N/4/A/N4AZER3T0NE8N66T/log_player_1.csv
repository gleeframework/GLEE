"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob a small portion.  I'm hoping he'll accept quickly to avoid the inflation risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's better to take this offer than risk further inflation. I would lose a lot more money by rejecting and going to the next round."
