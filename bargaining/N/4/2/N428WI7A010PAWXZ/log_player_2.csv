"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. It's fair and simple. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I'm not going to settle for an even split right away. There's still plenty of time, and I want to see if I can get a better deal.  Let's see what Alice comes up with next."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm feeling generous, but I'm also confident I can get a better deal in the future. This offer is a good starting point. Let's see what you think.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've adjusted my offer based on the rejection. I propose we divide the money more unevenly, with a higher share for me. This reflects the risk I'm taking by continuing to play this game. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Alice's offer is surprisingly fair considering the inflation factor.  I'm not sure if she's aware of the full inflation effect, but I'll take the 4000. It's better than the 0 I might get if we fail to agree."
