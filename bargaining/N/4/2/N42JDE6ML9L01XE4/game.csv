990000.0,10000.0,Let's start fair. I'll take 99% and leave 1% for you. We can negotiate from there if you prefer.,Alice,1,

550000.0,450000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share. Let's split it 55/45. We both get a decent amount and avoid further losses.",Alice,3,

350000.0,650000.0,"Okay Alice, let's be realistic. 55/45 is still too generous to you. I'm offering 65/35. It's a good deal considering the inflation working against me.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,Let's meet in the middle. I'm proposing a 60/40 split. This is fair considering the time we've wasted and the inflation we're both facing. We can avoid further losses and end this game.,Alice,5,
