"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I think we can negotiate from here.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively generous start, and keeping 60 dollars for myself. The message is a friendly opening gambit to see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you in the middle, but I'm hoping we can do better than that. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 50 dollars is actually worth 40 dollars (80% of 50).

I'm not sure if Bob's offer is a good one, considering the inflation. I'd like to try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure that's a great deal considering the inflation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to account for the devaluation of the currency.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. My gain of 40 dollars from round 2 is now worth 32 dollars (80% of 40).

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to give you a larger share this round. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial split.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 60 dollars, which is a significant portion of the remaining 100 dollars. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can finalize the split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit anxious about the inflation, can we do better than that? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 40 dollars from round 3 is now worth 20.8 dollars (48.8% of 40).

Considering the offer from Bob, I think it's a bit more favorable for me than the previous one. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving up that much more. I think I can do better than 45. Let's see if we can get closer to a 50-50 split.""
}
```"

{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share this round, but I'm not sure I can go any further. Let's see if this is acceptable to you.""
