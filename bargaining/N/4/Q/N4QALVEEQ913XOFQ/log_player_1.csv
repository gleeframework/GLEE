# Bob's message: You're not being generous, so I'll try to get more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share!

I'll reject his offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to give him 8000, that's too much."
