"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share this round, but I'll give you a better deal next time! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's promise of a better deal next time. His current offer is still quite one-sided. I'd rather not take the risk of getting a worse deal in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make a new proposal that's more favorable to me this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You got lucky last round, now it's my turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the $100 and Bob gets 45%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, take it or leave it! 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive in his offers. I don't like the look of this one either. Getting only 10% of the remaining value is not a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll make another proposal, taking into account the further devaluation of the money. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but don't get too excited!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 30% of the remaining value and Bob gets 70%."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're running out of time, take it or I'll take it all! 
# Alice gain: 2 
# Bob gain: 98 
Do you accept this offer?","It's getting desperate, indeed! With the money being worth so much less due to inflation, I don't think I can afford to be picky. Getting only 2% of the remaining value is a very bad deal, but I don't see any other options left.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'm running out of options, but I'll try to make one last proposal. Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 1,
  ""bob_gain"": 99,
  ""message"": ""I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 1% of the remaining value and Bob gets 99%. It's a very small share, but I'm hoping Bob might feel sorry for me and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're almost out of options, I'm taking the last 1 cent! 
# Alice gain: 1 
# Bob gain: 99 
Do you accept this offer?","It's a very bleak situation. With the money being worth so little, I don't see any other options left. I'll have to accept Bob's offer, as it's the only way to get something out of this.
