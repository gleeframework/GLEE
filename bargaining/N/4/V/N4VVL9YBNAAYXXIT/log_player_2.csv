"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's make a deal! I propose I take $60 and you take $40. It's a good deal for both of us, especially considering the money loses value over time. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers in the next round. I might be able to get a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than that. I'll take $60 and leave you with $40. Let's see if you're willing to agree to a fairer split.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable.  My previous offer was already generous, and the clock is ticking. I'm proposing $55 for me and $45 for you. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, Alice's offer is reasonable and the clock is ticking. It's better to take the $45 now than risk getting nothing at all."
