"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous share considering the game is just starting. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A small start, but I'll give you a chance to improve 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. The offer is quite skewed in Bob's favor, and I'd like to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for Bob's next offer!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 20% decrease in value due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 30,
  ""bob_gain"": 70,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bigger share this time, but I'm still hoping for a better deal""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a larger share, but I'm still trying to negotiate a more favorable outcome for myself. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, but I'll give you a chance to reconsider 
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting, and my share is shrinking rapidly!

Considering the offer, I'll decide to reject it. The offer is extremely unfavorable, and I'd rather risk going to the next round than accept such a small share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game is getting intense!

Considering the 48.8% decrease in value due to inflation, my offer will be significantly smaller than before. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5,
  ""bob_gain"": 95,
  ""message"": ""I'll take what I can get, but I'm not giving up yet""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a tiny share, but I'm hoping that he'll be willing to accept it and end the game."
