"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 950000, ""bob_gain"": 50000}
```

This offer gives me 95% of the money and Bob gets 5%. This is a very aggressive offer, but it reflects the potential for inflation, which could significantly erode the value of Bob's portion in the future."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is significantly worse for me than my initial offer.  Even with the inflation, I am losing a large portion of the money. I will reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise. It reflects the inflation that has occurred since round one, but it is still a significantly better deal for me than Bob's last offer.  I believe it is a fair compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 700000

Bob's offer is getting progressively worse for me, and the inflation is making it even more difficult to accept. I will continue to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

This offer is still a compromise but it accounts for the substantial inflation that has occurred. I believe it is a fair offer and hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly worse, and the inflation is significantly eroding the value of my potential gains.  I will continue to reject his offers and try to negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

This offer is a big concession on my part, but inflation is making it increasingly difficult to maintain a good share.  Hopefully, Bob will recognize the need to compromise and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is very low and the inflation is severely impacting the value of my portion. I will reject this offer and continue to negotiate for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

This is a 50/50 split, acknowledging the substantial inflation that has occurred and the fact that we are both now losing value with each passing round. I believe it is the fairest solution at this point."
