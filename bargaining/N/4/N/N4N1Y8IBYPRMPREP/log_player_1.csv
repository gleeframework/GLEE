I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer. I figure I can get a good deal by offering Bob a small amount, but still enough to hopefully incentivize him to take it.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer. Even though the money I'm gaining is worth 5% less than the first round, I'm still losing out significantly compared to the first round, and Bob is gaining more than before. I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to try a slightly different approach this time. Even though the money is worth less due to inflation, I'm still going to aim for a larger share, but I'll offer Bob a bit more than last time. This might entice him to accept, especially if he feels his offer is becoming less attractive due to inflation."
