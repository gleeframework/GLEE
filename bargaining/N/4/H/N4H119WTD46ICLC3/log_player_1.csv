"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can shake hands!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000 and keeping $600,000 for myself. I'm framing it as a fair split, but I'm hoping Bob will be eager to accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my share, I'm now looking at a reduced gain. Considering Bob's compromise, I'm inclined to accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
