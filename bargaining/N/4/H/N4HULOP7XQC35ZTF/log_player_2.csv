**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming significant. Rejecting this offer and hoping for a better deal in the next round is risky.  Alice seems to be aware of the inflation disadvantage and is unlikely to offer anything better in future rounds. Accepting now locks in a reasonable amount before inflation further erodes the value."
