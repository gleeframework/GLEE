Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json

""bob_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""Bob, my offer is decreasing with inflation. It's best we settle this now.""

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the current state of inflation affecting your gains significantly more than mine, I believe this offer strikes a balance between our interests, leaning towards a conclusion that benefits us both but acknowledges the changing value over time. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer isn't ideal, the value of my potential gains is decreasing rapidly due to inflation. If I reject this offer and make a counter-offer in Round 5, even a favorable split might be worth less than what Bob is offering now.  It's better to secure a reasonable amount now than risk getting even less later."
