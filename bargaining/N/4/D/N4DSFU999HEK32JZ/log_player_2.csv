"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take 90% and you get 10%. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a majority share. Let's split it 70/30.   
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing willingness to compromise, she's still benefiting heavily from the inflation.  We need to push her towards a more even split before the devaluation significantly hurts us."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking and we both lose if this fails. 55/45 is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Pressure:** By stating ""final offer"", we increase pressure on Alice.
* **Slight Compromise:** We show some movement from our previous 60/40 offer, indicating a willingness to negotiate but not to be walked over.
* **Inflation Factor:**  The longer this goes on, the more advantageous a 55/45 split (in our favor) becomes due to the differential inflation rates."
