"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 
Let's see if Bob is happy with a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a good starting point, but I'm ready to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly worse for me, but it's not a significant enough drop to accept right away. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42}
```

I'm going to stick with a slightly higher split than Bob offered, but I'm willing to negotiate. Inflation has hurt my side more, so I need to secure a decent return."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 52 
# Bob gain: 48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Inflation has significantly reduced the value of my potential gains, and Bob's offer is getting increasingly better for him. While I would prefer a better split, accepting this offer guarantees me some return, and further negotiation might lead to nothing."
