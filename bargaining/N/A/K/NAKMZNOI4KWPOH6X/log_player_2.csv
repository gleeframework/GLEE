Alice's offer:

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the inflation is hitting us both. I'm willing to meet in the middle, but I need a better deal than round 1. This is a fair offer. 
# Bob gain: 480000 
# Alice gain: 520000
