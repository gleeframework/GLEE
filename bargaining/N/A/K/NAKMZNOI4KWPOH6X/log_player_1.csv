Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the inflation puts me at a disadvantage, but your offer was a bit too skewed. How about a slightly better split for me this time? 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
