"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which is a fair and straightforward offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent chunk, but I'm not giving up too much yet 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll consider the offer from a relative perspective.

In this round, Bob is offering me $200,000, which is 20% of the remaining amount. Considering the inflation, I'd rather have a larger share now, but I'm not sure if I should push for more or accept this offer.

I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer in round 2 was $800,000, I'll try to counter with a slightly better offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much yet""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42% share for myself, which is a bit more aggressive than the 20% Bob offered in the previous round. Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give up too much yet, just like you 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation in mind, I notice that Bob's offer is actually a bit worse than my previous offer, considering the relative values. In round 3, I offered $420,000, which is 42% of the remaining amount, and now Bob is offering $400,000, which is 40% of the remaining amount.

Considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually worth less than mine, so I'll decide to...

```
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll take the $400,000 offer from Bob."
