Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your urgency, but I still think I deserve a bit more. This is my most generous offer yet. 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

The inflation is hitting me much harder than Alice. While her offer seems ""generous,"" I'm losing a significant chunk of the potential value with each round.  I need to push for a more favorable split soon, or the remaining money won't be worth much."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  We need to split this evenly now before the inflation eats away at everything.  A 50/50 split is the only fair option left.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm pushing for a 50/50 split. Here's why:

* **Urgency:**  The inflation is heavily skewed against me. Every round that passes significantly devalues the potential winnings. 
* **Fairness:** While Alice started with a slightly higher demand, the rapidly changing values make her previous offers unreasonable.  50/50 is the most straightforward and fair solution at this point.
* **Possible Agreement:**  Alice might be more open to accepting a 50/50 split now. She's likely realized that dragging this out further will hurt her potential gains too."
