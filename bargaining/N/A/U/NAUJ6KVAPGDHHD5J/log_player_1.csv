"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I figure I'll take the lion's share since we're in the first round and the inflation won't be as impactful yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to take the 5000 now than risk getting nothing at all. The inflation is going to eat away at the money with each round, and it's better to secure something than gamble on a better offer later."
