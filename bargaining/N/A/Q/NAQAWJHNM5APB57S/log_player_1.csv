  ""message"": ""Let's split the money 90-10, a fair start to the game!""

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see what Bob is trying to do! He's trying to flip the script and make me think he's the one who's being generous.

However, I'm not buying it. I think his offer is just a clever attempt to get me to agree to a low amount for myself. I'd rather wait and see if I can get a better deal.

# Alice gain: 190000 
# Bob gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to turn the tables on me again, but this time with a more subtle message. He's hinting that he's being generous, but also implying that he's starting to get frustrated with the negotiations.

However, I'm not convinced. His offer is actually very similar to my previous offer, and I think he's just trying to make me think he's being more generous than he actually is.

# Bob gain: 523100 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to appeal to my sense of reason and fairness, but I'm not buying it. This offer is actually identical to my previous offer, and I'm starting to think that Bob is just trying to get me to agree to a deal that benefits him more.

I'm not falling for it. I'd rather wait for a better offer.
