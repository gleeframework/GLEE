"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be a bit more even this time. I'm willing to give you a bit more since you're getting less in each round. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with this offer. I was hoping for a more significant increase in my share considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation. I'd like to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise and meet in the middle. This way, we can both get a decent share despite the inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but still a reasonable compromise considering the decreasing value of the money."
