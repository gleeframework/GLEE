"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. With a 20% decrease in value for me and only a 10% decrease for Alice, I'm not keen on accepting this proposal just yet. Let's see what I can come up with next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's try a bit more in my favor, considering the inflation hits me harder.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The inflation is working against you, Bob. Let's be reasonable and close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the offer seems slightly more favorable than the first round, considering the impact of inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. The difference in how inflation affects us means I'm losing more value with each round, but I'm willing to take that risk for now. Let's proceed and see if I can turn the tables in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5800, ""alice_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Inflation is biting, but I'm still willing to push for a bit more. Let's see if we can meet in the middle, considering the value I'm losing with each round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is a good deal considering the rapid devaluation. We're both losing out the longer this goes on. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on my potential gain, which is now worth 59.04% less than in the first round, I still believe there's room for negotiation. The fact that Alice's gain is also decreasing, albeit at a slower rate, means she has an incentive to close the deal. However, I'm willing to push for a slightly better offer, given the substantial devaluation I'm facing. Let's see what the next round brings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a harder stance now, given the massive hit I'm taking from inflation. I believe this offer is more reflective of the urgency to close the deal, considering the value we're both losing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this needs to end soon.  The value is slipping away with each round. 
# Bob gain: 5200 
# Alice gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain now worth 73.79% less than in the first round, the impact of inflation is becoming increasingly severe. Given this significant devaluation and the fact that Alice is also losing substantial value, her offer seems relatively balanced under the current circumstances. I'll accept this offer to mitigate further losses from inflation.
