"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I propose a 55/45 split to start. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself.  I'm willing to negotiate, but a 55/45 split is not a good starting point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, considering we both have to split the money.  Let's start with this and see if we can agree.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out, and the value is decreasing. I'm coming down to 52/48. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with the deal.  I'm going to try to push for a better split, even if it means more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Alice. Let's split it 55/45, but I need to get at least this amount to make it worth my while.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  51/49 is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 4900 
# Alice gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

With each round, the value of the money I gain keeps decreasing. It's better to accept this offer than risk getting nothing at all."
