Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was kind, but let's be realistic.  I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor.  Time is money, and we both know inflation is eating away at this deal. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000
