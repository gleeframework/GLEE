Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a larger share, but we need to find a compromise. Inflation is hitting us both hard. This 60/40 split gives us both a fair amount while allowing us to secure a deal before the money loses too much value. Let's be reasonable. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While not ideal, accepting a 40/40 split in round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation Impact:**  The longer the game goes, the less the money is worth. A 400,000 gain now is significantly better than potentially getting a slightly better deal in later rounds when inflation has eroded its value.
* **Alice's Position:**  Alice has moved from a very favorable split to a more reasonable one. This indicates a willingness to compromise, but she's unlikely to accept anything drastically different in future rounds.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a better deal is very risky. If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will offer anything close in subsequent rounds, and the value of the money will continue to decrease. 

It's better for Bob to secure a decent amount now than gamble on a potentially worse outcome later.
