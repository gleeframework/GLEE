"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split is fair and gives us both a good share. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's not terrible, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'm hoping to get at least 50% of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I think this split is more fair. It gives us both a good amount, and it's a better starting point for negotiation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're losing money because of inflation!  My turn to propose a fairer split, let's get this done. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, it's better to accept this offer. With inflation, the money will continue to lose value.  It's important to secure some of the money before it's all gone!"
