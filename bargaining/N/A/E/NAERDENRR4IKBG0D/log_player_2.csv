While the offer is tempting, it's important to see what kind of deals Alice is willing to make in future rounds. There's a good chance I can get a better deal for myself."

# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice's offers are getting progressively worse for me. While her message suggests a ""middle ground"", the actual split is shifting further in her favor. I'll continue to play and see if I can negotiate a better deal."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not going to let you take advantage of the inflation. This is my best offer so far. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

Alice's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable.  Although she claims it's her best, the reality is that with each round, the money is becoming less valuable for both of us.  I'm going to push for a more equitable deal."
