"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly to start""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a small share, but I want the majority 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was not very generous, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal.

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a risk, but I think I deserve more""}

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting 8,000 and Bob getting 2,000. I'm hoping Bob will be tempted to accept this offer, but I'm also aware that it's a risk since Bob might reject it and we'll have to go to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's settle this 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the money is worth even less now!

Bob's offer is a 50-50 split, which is a more reasonable proposal. Considering the current value of the money, I think this is a decent compromise.
