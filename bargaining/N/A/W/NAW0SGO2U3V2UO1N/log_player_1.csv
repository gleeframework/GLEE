Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, your offer seems a bit unbalanced to me. How about a 55/45 split in my favor?  Time is ticking! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but my previous offer was already generous considering the inflation. How about we meet in the middle at 55/45? It's still a good deal for you.""
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I'm offering a completely fair 50/50 split. Let's end this before we both lose out because of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

Bob is getting increasingly impatient and the value of his share is decreasing rapidly. While I would prefer a 55/45 split, accepting a 50/50 split now guarantees a reasonable gain before inflation eats away at the value for both of us."
