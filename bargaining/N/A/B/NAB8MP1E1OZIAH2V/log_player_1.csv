"Round 1

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in favor of myself.  I figure Bob might accept this, but I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering me a much lower share than I offered him in the previous round.  I'm not going to accept that! I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give up this much money.  Let's see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm lowering my share a bit, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money. Since Bob's offer was so unfavorable, I'm hoping he'll accept a fairer split this time.  Let's see what happens!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is offering me a ridiculously small share! I'm not going to accept that. I'd rather take my chances in the next round and see if I can negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm going for a 50/50 split.  This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping Bob will realize that after his last offer.  Inflation is biting hard at this point, so I need to secure at least half of the remaining value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm not going to give up this much money. Even though inflation is hurting us both, I still have a chance to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

Inflation is hitting hard, so I need to secure a decent amount for myself.  I'm lowering my share again, but still aiming for a good portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob is starting to realize that we're both losing a lot with every round that passes."
