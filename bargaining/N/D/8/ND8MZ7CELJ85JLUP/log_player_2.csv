"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. The current offer doesn't seem fair, and I'm willing to take the risk of inflation to try and get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, considering the inflation I'm taking a hit on.""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Don't be greedy, Bob. The clock is ticking and your share is shrinking! 
# Bob gain: 3500 
# Alice gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough the offer is slightly better than the first one, considering the inflation, I'm actually getting less value than before. I'll take the risk and wait for the next round to try and negotiate a better deal. The pressure is on, but I'm not ready to give in yet."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'm taking a bigger risk due to inflation, so I need a better deal to compensate. This is my final offer before things get really bad for me.""}"
