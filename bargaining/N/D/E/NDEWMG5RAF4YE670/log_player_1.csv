"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, with me taking $900,000 and Bob taking $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point considering the potential for inflation.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 30/70 split in favor of Bob is a significant shift from my initial offer, it's still a substantial gain for him, considering the inflation impacting the value of the money. I believe I can still secure a more favorable deal.  Let's see what I can propose in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This still gives Bob a significant share of the money, but it brings the division closer to what I believe is fair given the inflation we're experiencing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While a 45/55 split is closer to equal than Bob's previous offer, it still feels like a significant concession given the impact of inflation. I believe there's still room for a more favorable deal for me in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I propose an even split of $500,000 each. With the increasing inflation, it's becoming more difficult to negotiate a larger share.  I believe this is the fairest offer considering the current circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I am still hopeful that I can get a more favorable deal. Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, and with each round, the value of the money is decreasing.  I am confident that I can push for a more equitable split in the remaining rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}
```

I propose a 45/55 split in my favor.  While Bob is likely to be resistant to giving up more of the money, I believe that this offer reflects the current inflationary pressures.  This split represents a compromise, and I hope it will be acceptable to him considering the shrinking value of the money with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  While the value of the money is decreasing, I still believe I can get a more favorable deal.  I will continue to negotiate and push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}
```

I propose a 40/60 split in my favor. With the significant inflation impacting the value of the money, I believe this offer is a fair compromise. I'm willing to give Bob a larger share, but I cannot accept his previous offers.  Let's see if this proposal is acceptable to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36.98% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 61.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is becoming increasingly unreasonable.  While the value of the money is decreasing, I still believe I can get a more favorable deal.  I will continue to negotiate and push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 350000, ""bob_gain"": 650000}
```

With only two rounds left, and the value of the money plummeting, I propose a 35/65 split in my favor. This is a significant concession on my part, but I believe it's the best we can do under these circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 11.

Round 12
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 43.12% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 68.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While this is a significantly worse deal than I hoped for, it's better than nothing. With only one round remaining, and the value of the money plummeting rapidly, it's likely we both end up with nothing if I reject this offer.  I'm taking it."
