  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money quickly""

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the total amount. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer and we can wrap up the game quickly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I'm willing to take a slightly smaller share, but I think this split is more balanced. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to be fair, but I'm not going to fall for it. I think I can do better than that. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer.
