"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point?""
}
```

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leaving $4,000 for Bob. I think this is a reasonable starting point, but I'm open to negotiations!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

Considering the new proposal from Bob, I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's a big gap, can you meet me in the middle?""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept such an uneven split, especially considering the inflation that's reducing my potential gains. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the previous offers, I'll try to make a more balanced proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground, how about 45-55 split?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation that's affecting my potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not satisfied with the split. I think I deserve more. How about this? 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a hit on my potential earnings now!

Considering Bob's new offer, I'll have to think carefully...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""That's even more uneven than before, can you meet me at 50-50?""
}
```

I'm trying to find a fair split, but Bob's offers are getting progressively more one-sided. I'm hoping he'll be more willing to compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","The inflation is really affecting my potential earnings now!

Considering the previous offers and the fact that the money is worth less and less with each passing round, I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet at 50-50, it's the fairest split considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm trying to be more assertive and propose a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will finally accept and we can end the game."
