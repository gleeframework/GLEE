"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 600,000 and Bob gets 400,000. I think this is a good starting point, and it's a fair split considering we're both starting from scratch."
