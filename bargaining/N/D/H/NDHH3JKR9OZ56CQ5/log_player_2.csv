"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I get $600,000, you get $400,000.  It's a good deal considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be fair. We both lose if this drags on. 550k for me, 450k for you. It's a good deal considering the time pressure."" 
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my turn, and the clock is ticking. I'll take a slight hit from my last offer: $570,000 for me, $430,000 for you.  Let's close this deal before inflation eats away at our profits. 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to take advantage of the situation, but her offer is only slightly better than her last one. By rejecting, I signal I'm not desperate and willing to risk a few more rounds for a fairer share. The inflation hurts, but it hurts us both."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 520000,
""alice_gain"": 480000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is money!  This back and forth is costing us both.  I'm offering you 480k, I take 520k.  It's a fair split, let's wrap this up."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer, but we need to find a middle ground.  $540,000 for me, $460,000 for you.  We both know the longer this takes, the less we both walk away with. 
# Bob gain: 460000 
# Alice gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, this offer is better than what I might get if I continue to reject and the negotiations fail.  It's clear Alice is aiming for a 55/45 split, and this is close enough with the added pressure of inflation.  Better to secure a decent amount now than risk getting a much smaller share later, or even nothing."
