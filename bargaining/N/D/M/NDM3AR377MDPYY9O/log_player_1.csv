"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start with. I think this is a fair and simple way to begin.""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving each of us $5,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly higher amount, but I'm not willing to give up too much at this point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer.

Since Bob's offer is worth 20% less than the original amount, his gain of $6,000 is actually equivalent to $4,800 in the original amount. This means he's offering me $4,000 and keeping $4,800 for himself.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'm willing to consider it. I'll accept the offer, hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
