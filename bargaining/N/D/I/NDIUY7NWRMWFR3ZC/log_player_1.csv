I'm going to propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor.  I figure I'm the one making the proposal, so I'll aim for a good chunk of the money.  However, I'm not being completely unreasonable - I'm leaving Bob with a decent share.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  While it's better than the 1000 I was offered in round 1, I'm still getting significantly less than I initially proposed.  Plus, there's still inflation to consider.  Since my money isn't losing value in this round, I'm in a better position to hold out for a better deal.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to propose a 7000/3000 split in my favor.  Bob offered me 6000, which is better than the 1000 I was offered in the first round, but I'm still not happy with that.  I'm going to try to meet him halfway, but I'm still aiming for a majority share since my money isn't losing value this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  While I'd still prefer a larger share, Bob is clearly getting more stubborn.  The inflation is also starting to affect him, meaning his offer is likely to only get worse if I reject it.  A 50/50 split is a fair compromise, especially considering the potential for further losses in the future."
