Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. I believe this is a fair offer considering I'm the one making the first move.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  A 50/50 split is fair, and with inflation, I'm not sure how much better I can do in the next round."
