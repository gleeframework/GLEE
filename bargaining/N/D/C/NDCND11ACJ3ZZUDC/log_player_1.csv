Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm taking a very aggressive stance in the first round, aiming for almost all of the money.  Since we don't know how the inflation affects Bob, it's a gamble. 
Let's see if he's willing to accept such a small share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I'd prefer to keep more of the money, the inflation makes it risky to keep rejecting offers. This offer gives me a significant portion of the money, and the next round might be even worse for me due to inflation. Accepting this offer seems like the most logical move."
