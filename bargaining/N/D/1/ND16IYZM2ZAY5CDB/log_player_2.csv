Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 5% less to me with each passing round, I'd like to try to maximize my gain before accepting an offer. Let's see what happens in the next round!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'd like a bit more, considering the inflation!""}"

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'll increase my share a bit, but I'm not willing to go much higher. Let's make a deal! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, the value of the money I gain is decreasing with each round. Alice's offer of 48 is actually worth less than the face value due to the 9.75% decrease in value. I'll proceed to the next round to try to get a better deal, despite the decreasing value, in hopes that Alice will increase her offer to compensate for the loss in value due to inflation."

# Alice's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm starting to get concerned about the inflation too.  Let's find a middle ground. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, considering the inflation, the value of the money I gain is significantly decreasing with each round. Alice's offer of 45 is actually worth even less due to the 18.55% decrease in value. I'll proceed to the next round, hoping that Alice will increase her offer to compensate for the loss in value due to inflation. However, I'll also keep in mind that we are getting closer to the 12-round limit, and I might need to accept a less favorable offer soon to avoid getting nothing."

Round 6

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting worried about how much the money is losing value. I'm offering a bit more, but we need to settle soon! 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, although Alice is offering a bit more, the value of the money I gain is still decreasing significantly due to inflation. With a 26.49% decrease in value, Alice's offer of 43 is actually worth substantially less. However, I'll consider that we are over halfway through the rounds, and the pressure to settle is increasing. I'll try to negotiate further, but I might need to accept a less favorable offer soon to avoid losing everything."

Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, although Alice is increasing her offer, the value of the money I gain is still decreasing significantly due to inflation. With a 33.66% decrease in value, Alice's offer of 40 is actually worth substantially less. However, I'll consider that we are running out of time, and Alice has stated that this is her last offer. I'll try to negotiate one more time, but I'll have to carefully weigh the risks of rejecting this offer and potentially getting nothing if we don't reach an agreement in the next few rounds."
