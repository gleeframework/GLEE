"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the smaller share this round.""}

I'm proposing that I take 6000 and Bob takes 4000. I'm trying to be fair and take the smaller share this round, hoping Bob will accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share this round, but still leaving some for you 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob taking a bigger share, but I'm willing to consider it. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

I'll accept Bob's offer for now, hoping that he'll be more generous in the next round. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
