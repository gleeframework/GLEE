"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and take $6000 for myself. I've also included a message that says ""Let's be fair"" to convey my intention of being reasonable and open to negotiations. Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer for now. Although the 55/45 split might seem reasonable, I'm not ready to settle for $4500, considering the original amount was $10,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to try to get a better deal. Let's proceed!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","### {""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4200 and take $5800 for myself. Considering the inflation, I've reduced my initial offer to try to meet Bob halfway. My message ""Meet me in the middle"" conveys my willingness to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Your turn, Bob!"
