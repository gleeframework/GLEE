Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 42 
# Alice gain: 58

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""This is my final offer. A 50/50 split is the fairest option. Take it or leave it.""}"

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still not convinced. Meet me in the middle of our last offers 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is offering a slight compromise, time is working against me due to inflation. Accepting $43 now is a significantly worse deal than accepting $42 in the previous round. I need to push for a more agreeable split quickly, or I risk getting a much worse deal as inflation eats further into my potential gains."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 47, ""alice_gain"": 53, ""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and inflation is hurting both of us. This is my last offer before I have to start making drastic changes to account for the losses. Let's close this deal.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 73.79% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're getting desperate, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. This is my most generous offer yet 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

The inflation is becoming critical. While not ideal, accepting $44 now is better than risking a worse offer in the remaining rounds where the value will decrease even further. It's a difficult decision, but the risk of ending up with nothing is too high."
