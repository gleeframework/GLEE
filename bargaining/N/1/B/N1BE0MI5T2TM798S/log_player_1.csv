"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose keeping 90% of the money and giving Bob 10%. I'm aiming for a large share early on, hoping to secure a good deal before inflation kicks in."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is a good deal for me. While I'm losing 40% of my initial offer, I'm still getting a substantial amount of money and the value of the money will continue to decline if I reject.  It's better to secure something now than risk getting nothing later."
