"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 990000, ""bob_gain"": 10000} 
``` 

I'm going to offer Bob a very small amount to see if he's willing to accept a very unequal split.  I'm hoping that he'll be greedy and think he can get more in the future.  This will help me get the majority of the money, even with the inflation.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's a significant amount of money, I know that the inflation is going to affect me more and more with each round. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can convince Bob to make a better deal in the next round.  He's already shown himself to be willing to be greedy, and I'm going to try to use that to my advantage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share than before, but still keeping the majority for myself.  The inflation is starting to bite, but I think I can still get a good deal if I play my cards right.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a step in the right direction and be more willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer again.  Bob is clearly trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in.  I'm still confident that I can get a better deal if I hold out a few more rounds. I'm going to keep pushing for a more equitable split, and I'm hoping that Bob will eventually realize that he needs to compromise if he wants to get anything at all."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000} 
```

I'm increasing my offer to Bob again, trying to find a compromise point. While the inflation is hurting me, I'm willing to give a bit more to see if we can reach an agreement.  I'm hoping that Bob is starting to realize that he needs to be more reasonable if he wants to get a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is still trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not going to give in. I'm going to continue rejecting his offers until he realizes that he needs to offer me a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

The inflation is really starting to hurt now, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I'm going to offer Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm not willing to give him more than 30% of the money.  I'm hoping that he'll finally see that he needs to make a compromise if he wants to get anything at all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 510000 
# Bob gain: 490000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While it's not ideal, the inflation is really starting to take its toll. I'm getting a slightly smaller share than I would have liked, but it's better than getting nothing at all. Bob is finally being more reasonable, and I don't want to risk losing everything by continuing to reject his offers."
