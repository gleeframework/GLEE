"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I'm Alice, I want to maximize my share.  In the first round, I'm taking a gamble by offering Bob a very small amount.  

* **If Bob accepts:** I get almost all the money.
* **If Bob rejects:** We go to the next round, and Bob will have to make an offer.  I can then see if he's willing to negotiate. 

This strategy plays on the potential for Bob to be risk-averse. He might be willing to accept even a small amount rather than risk getting nothing."
