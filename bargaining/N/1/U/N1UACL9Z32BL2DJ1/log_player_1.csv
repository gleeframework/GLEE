Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm starting with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a deal quickly.  I'll see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more, Bob's offer is still better than what I would get after the next round of inflation. It's time to secure some of this money!"
