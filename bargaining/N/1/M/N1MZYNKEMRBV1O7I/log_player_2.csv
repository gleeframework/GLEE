Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this is a more generous offer 
# Bob gain: 4200

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation hurts you more, my offer reflects that 
# Bob gain: 3800 
# Alice gain: 6200 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, accepting is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  With each round, the value of Bob's potential gain decreases drastically due to inflation. Waiting any longer will only result in a worse deal for him. 
* **Alice's Position:** Alice knows Bob is being hit hard by inflation. She's unlikely to offer anything significantly better than this, especially as she doesn't experience the inflation.
* **Something is better than nothing:**  While 3800 is significantly less than what Bob could have gotten in earlier rounds, it's better than holding out for a better deal that might never come and ending up with nothing. 

By round 5, the game has become heavily skewed against Bob. It's a tough pill to swallow, but taking the current offer prevents further losses."
