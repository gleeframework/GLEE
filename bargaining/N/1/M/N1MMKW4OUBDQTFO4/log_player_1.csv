Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than that.  Let's split the difference - I'll take 55% and you get 45%.  This way, we both get a decent share and we don't have to risk the money losing value in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
