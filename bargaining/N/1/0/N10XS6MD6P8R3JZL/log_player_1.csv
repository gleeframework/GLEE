"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $100 in a 75/25 split. This offers a reasonable share for both of us considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share given the initial amount. This offer still leaves you with a decent portion, and it's a good starting point for further negotiation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
