Do you accept this offer?","```json

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, my offer stands. This is a fair deal that accounts for the inflation affecting us both, though you more severely. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stubbornly sticking to his offer, but it's becoming increasingly worse for me due to the inflation difference. It's risky, but I need to push for a better deal while I still have some leverage."
