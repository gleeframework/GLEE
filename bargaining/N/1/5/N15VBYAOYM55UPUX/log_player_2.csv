I'm not sure about this offer. Even though it's fair, I want to see if I can get a better deal for myself.  Let's see what Alice offers next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40 this time, I'll take the bigger share, but next round it's your turn to propose!""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: My turn! Slightly better deal for me this time. 
# Bob gain: 3900 
# Alice gain: 6100 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

I'll accept this offer. Even though the inflation is making my gains worth less, I'd rather take what I can get than risk getting nothing at all."
