"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I propose dividing the money 3:1 in favor of Alice. This ensures a fair share while considering the risk of inflation. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While the offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to remember the inflation factor. Rejecting and proposing a different split allows me to potentially get a larger share later on."
