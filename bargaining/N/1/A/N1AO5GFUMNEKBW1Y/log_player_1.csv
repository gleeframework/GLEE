"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, and see where it goes from here.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly biased split, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting Bob's gain, I'll have to be strategic. I'd rather not give up a significant portion of the money, especially since the split is already biased towards Bob.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was biased towards him, I'll try to adjust the split in my favor. I'll propose a slightly more aggressive split, but still willing to compromise.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need to get a better deal for myself.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, I'm taking a firmer stance 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to his favor. Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to be cautious. However, this offer is actually quite close to my initial proposal, and I don't want to give up more than I have to.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair split, and I don't want to risk losing more money by rejecting it.
