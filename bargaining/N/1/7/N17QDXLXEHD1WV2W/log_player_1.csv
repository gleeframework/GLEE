"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's keep it simple and split the money evenly. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit equally.  We're already losing money to inflation by dragging this out. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
