"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this proposal, I, Alice, am offering to take $60 and give Bob $40. I've also included a message, ""Let's be fair!"", to convey a sense of cooperation and mutual benefit. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nIn this proposal, Bob is offering me $45, which, due to inflation, is now worth 5% less than it was in the first round. Meanwhile, Bob will take $55, which is worth 10% less for him due to the higher inflation rate he's experiencing. Considering the impact of inflation and the fact that I, Alice, initially offered a 60-40 split in my favor, I don't find Bob's offer of a 45-55 split in his favor to be acceptable, especially given the message that it's a ""fair split, considering the inflation."" The decrease in value due to inflation affects both of us but hits Bob harder, yet his offer doesn't seem to account for the initial fairness I proposed. Therefore, I will reject this offer and proceed to the next round, hoping to negotiate a better deal.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nLet's proceed to the next round and see how the negotiations continue!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nGiven that we're now in Round 3 and the effects of inflation are becoming more pronounced, I'll need to adjust my offer to try and find a mutually acceptable division. Considering Bob's last offer was a 45-55 split in his favor and taking into account the increasing impact of inflation, I'll propose a compromise that slightly adjusts my initial offer but still reflects the greater loss in value Bob faces.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 57, ""bob_gain"": 43, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\n###\n\nWith this offer, I'm still aiming for a higher share but have reduced my portion from the initial 60% to 57%, offering Bob 43%, which is slightly better than my initial offer but not as high as what he proposed in the last round. The message ""Considering inflation, let's meet closer to the middle"" is intended to convey a willingness to compromise in light of the decreasing value of the money for both of us, but particularly for Bob. Let's see how Bob responds to this adjusted proposal!"
