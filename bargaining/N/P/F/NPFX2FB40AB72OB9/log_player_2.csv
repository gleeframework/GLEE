Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I understand you wanting to start fair, but with the money losing value, my turn requires a bit more compensation for the risk.  How about we reverse the offer?""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I see your point about the risk. Let's split the difference.  I'll take 54, and you can have 46.  This way, we both get a little more than our initial offer. 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
