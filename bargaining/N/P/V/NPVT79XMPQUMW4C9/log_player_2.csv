"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take a small slice of the pie, but I'll get you a better deal next round. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer because I believe I can get a better deal in the next round. Although there's a 20% inflation, I'm hoping to get a significantly larger share of the money to offset the loss. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take 40% and you take 60%. It's better for both of us to agree now, before inflation gets worse.""}\n\n###\n\nI'm making this offer because I want to take into account the inflation that will occur in subsequent rounds. By proposing a 40-60 split, I'm hoping Alice will see the value in accepting a reasonable offer now rather than risking further negotiations. The message aims to appeal to Alice's sense of fairness and highlight the benefits of agreeing to a deal sooner rather than later."
