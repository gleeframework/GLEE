Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll take 40% and you take 60%. It's better for both of us to agree now, before inflation gets worse. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
