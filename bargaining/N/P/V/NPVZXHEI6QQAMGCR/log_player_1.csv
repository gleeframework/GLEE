"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start by making a proposal. Here's my offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair and reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is a 40/60 split, which is even more favorable to him than my initial offer. I'll reject this offer.

{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of the money. Since Bob's offer in the previous round was 40/60, I'll try to make a more favorable offer for myself. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}

This offer is a 42/58 split, which is more favorable to me than the previous offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money I gain worth the same as in the first round and Bob's gain being worth significantly less due to inflation, I'll consider this offer. A 30/70 split is a significant concession from my previous offer, and considering the decreased value of Bob's gain, I'll accept this offer.
