Let's see if Bob is feeling generous!  I'm offering him a small share to hopefully get this game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject this offer.  Bob's offer is unfair, and I'm willing to gamble on getting a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm offering a more balanced split this time, hoping to reach a compromise. Bob's last offer was too lopsided, and I'm confident I can secure a fairer deal."
