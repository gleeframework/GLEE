"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is a fair deal for both of us. Let's get this over with! 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm not accepting this offer as I believe I can negotiate for a better deal. The current offer gives me only 10% of the total amount, which I think is too low. I'm willing to take the risk of proceeding to the next round to try and get a better offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 400000, ""alice_gain"": 600000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 40% for me, 60% for you.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money loses 10% of its value for me with each passing round, I want to try to reach an agreement quickly. However, I also want a fair share, so I'm proposing a division that gives me 40% and Alice 60%. This way, both of us get a significant amount, and we can end the game early to minimize the impact of inflation on my share."
