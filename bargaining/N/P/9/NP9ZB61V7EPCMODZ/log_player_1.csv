"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering we have 11 more rounds to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is a bit more aggressive, but I'll consider it.

I'll reject this offer for now, since I'm not willing to give up 60% of the remaining $10,000. I'll wait for a better offer.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is now worth 5% less than in the previous round. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to account for the decreased value of the money, while still trying to get a decent share for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is sticking to his guns. I'll think carefully about this offer...

After considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll accept this offer. It's not the best I could have hoped for, but it's better than nothing, and we're running out of rounds.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
