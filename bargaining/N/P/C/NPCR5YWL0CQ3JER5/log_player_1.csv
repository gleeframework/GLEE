"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a small share to get us started.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I'm not going to give away too much just yet! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, my gain of 4000 is now worth 3600.

I'll reject this offer since I was hoping for a slightly better split. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 10% less again, my offer from Round 1 would be worth 7,200 (10,000 x 0.9 x 0.9 = 7290) if I were to go back to that. I'll try to negotiate a better deal this time. Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not giving up yet! I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm not going to back down! 
# Alice gain: 2500 
# Bob gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of 5500 from Round 3 is now worth 3993.5 (5500 x 0.9 x 0.9 x 0.9 = 3993.45). I'll compare this to Bob's new offer.

I'll reject this offer since it's even worse than my previous offer, considering the reduced value of the money. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, my gain of 5500 from Round 3 is now worth 3993.5 (as calculated before). I'll try to negotiate a better deal this time. Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, Bob. Let's see if we can reach a deal.""
