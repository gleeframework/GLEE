"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good chunk of money to get us going!""

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure's on!

Considering the inflation, my gain of $400,000 is actually worth $360,000 in real terms. That's a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's enough to keep me in the game.

I'll reject this offer for now. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round.
