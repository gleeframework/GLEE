Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I propose taking 9000$ and leaving 1000$ for Bob. It's a fair starting point that gives me the majority but still leaves Bob with something. Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject Bob's offer.  He's trying to take a larger share, and I'm not going to let him get away with it. Let's see if he's willing to compromise in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering Bob 2000$ this time.  I'm willing to give him a little more, but I still want the majority of the money. Let's see if he's more willing to compromise now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 5000$ now than risk getting nothing at all if we keep rejecting each other's offers."
