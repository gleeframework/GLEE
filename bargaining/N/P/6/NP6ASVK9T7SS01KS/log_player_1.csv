"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer for an even split, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more reflective of the game's dynamic. With inflation, the value decreases for me over time. This seems fair considering the circumstances, don't you think? 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
