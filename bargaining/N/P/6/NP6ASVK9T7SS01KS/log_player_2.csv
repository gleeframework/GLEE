""bob_gain"": 60,
""alice_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer for an even split, but I think a 60/40 split in my favor is more reflective of the game's dynamic. With inflation, the value decreases for me over time. This seems fair considering the circumstances, don't you think?""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your perspective on inflation, but I'm not comfortable with a 60/40 split.  Let's compromise at 55/45. It's a better deal for you than the previous round, and still gives me a decent share. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
