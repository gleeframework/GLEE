"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While it seems fair, Bob should reject this offer. The goal is to maximize his gains, and since the value of the money will decrease with each round,  holding out for a better deal makes sense."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the potential for the money to lose value in the future rounds. Let's see what you think.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Your turn! 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Bob should accept this offer.  The value of the money is decreasing, and while this offer isn't as good as his initial proposal, it's still a significant gain and better than the risk of getting nothing in later rounds."
