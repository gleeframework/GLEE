"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for a first offer. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the potential for the money to lose value in the future rounds. Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Interesting that Bob wants to stick with the 60-40 split, but this time with the numbers reversed.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, considering the inflation effect. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less this round, I'd rather get a larger share now to compensate for the loss in value.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to compromise. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, trying to balance the risk of inflation with the potential for a better deal in future rounds."
