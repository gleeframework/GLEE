I'm starting with a very uneven split, hoping Bob will be eager to accept and avoid the risk of inflation.  Let's see how it goes!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While it's not ideal, I'm losing value with every round, and Bob's offer is still better than what I'd likely get in future rounds.  It's time to take what I can get!"
