"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

This offer gives me a larger share, but it is still a fair starting point. I am hoping Bob will accept it, as he will get a decent amount as well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While I am not happy about the lower amount, I am hoping to get a better deal in the next round.  I am willing to take the risk and reject this offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly lower amount for myself this time, acknowledging Bob's previous offer.  I believe this is still a fair split, and I'm hoping he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the money is worth significantly less now, I need to accept this offer. Bob's offer is close to my previous proposal and I risk losing out on an even smaller share in the next round."
