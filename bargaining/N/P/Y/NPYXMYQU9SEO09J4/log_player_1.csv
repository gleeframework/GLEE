"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```

  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a small amount to test the waters.""

This way, I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount, but I'm also keeping most of the money for myself. Let's see how he reacts!"

Round 2

# Bob's message: You offered me a small amount, now it's my turn to make a bigger move. I'll give you a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal. Given the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to be more cautious.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
