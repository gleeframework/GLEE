"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI am offering Bob $400,000 and I will take $600,000. This way, we both get a significant amount of money, but I get a bit more since I made the offer. The message ""Let's be fair"" is to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him more likely to accept the offer.\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer. If he rejects, I will make a new offer in the next round. Remember to apply the inflation rates if we proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better. Let's split it evenly. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI am rejecting Bob's offer because, although the money is worth less now due to inflation, I believe I can still get a better deal. Since Bob is offering me $400,000, which is worth 10% less than in the first round, I am effectively getting $360,000 in first-round value. Meanwhile, Bob is getting $600,000, which is worth 20% less than in the first round, so he is effectively getting $480,000 in first-round value. Given that I made a more generous offer in the first round, I think I can negotiate for a better split.\n\nPlease let Bob know that I rejected his offer and it's my turn to make a new proposal. Remember to apply the inflation rates for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nI am offering Bob $450,000 and I will take $550,000. This offer is more generous than my first offer, but still favorable to me. Given that the money is worth less now due to inflation, I believe this is a reasonable compromise. The message ""Meet me in the middle"" is to suggest that we are both making concessions and that this offer is a fair middle ground.\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts or rejects the offer. If he rejects, I will make a new offer in the next round. Remember to apply the inflation rates if we proceed to the next round."
