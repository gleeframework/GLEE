# Alice gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 25:75, I'll try to adjust the ratio in my favor. Considering the 20% inflation, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 30, ""alice_gain"": 70}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, my initial offer of 30:70 was actually quite generous. Now that Alice has made a new offer, I'll try to adjust my strategy. Since the money is worth less, I'll aim for an even higher share. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","With the inflation continuing to erode the value of the money, I'll aim for an even higher share. Since Alice's offer was 40:60, I'll try to push for a 50:50 split, but with a slight bias towards myself. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the money being worth less than half of its original value, I'm getting desperate. Since Alice is now offering a 50:50 split, I'll accept it to avoid getting even less in subsequent rounds. Here's my decision:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
