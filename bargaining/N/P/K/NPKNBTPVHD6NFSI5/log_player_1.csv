I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. I'm hoping he'll accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3

I'm offering a 50/50 split this time. It seems like a fair and reasonable way to divide the money, and I hope Bob will accept it."
