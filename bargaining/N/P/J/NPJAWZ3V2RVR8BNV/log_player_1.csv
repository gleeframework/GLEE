"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 900,000 to 100,000 split in my favor. This gives Bob a small share to start, but I believe it's a fair starting point given the inflation dynamic."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm willing to lower my share slightly to 750,000, hoping to incentivize Bob to accept before the inflation impacts him further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is getting increasingly unfavorable as the inflation continues.  I'm not willing to accept a significantly smaller share than what I've been offering, particularly since I'm not losing any value from the inflation.  I need to continue negotiating to secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to stick with a proposal that gives me a majority of the share but offers Bob a substantial sum as well. It's a compromise, but I believe it's the best way to avoid the risk of us both getting nothing due to continued inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is now extremely unfavorable due to the heavy inflation on his side.  While I could accept a significantly lower share, I'm confident that we can reach a more equitable agreement with just a few rounds left.  I need to continue playing strategically to secure a fair outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

This offer still maintains a majority share for me, but I'm further reducing my gain to try and incentivize Bob to accept. The inflation is becoming increasingly significant for him, and I believe it's in both of our best interests to come to an agreement before the remaining rounds pass."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly absurd due to the inflation.  While I could accept a small share to avoid ending up with nothing, I'm not willing to accept such a drastic imbalance.  I'm confident that we can find a more equitable agreement with a few rounds remaining."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  Given the inflation, this is the fairest offer I can make while still trying to secure a significant share for myself. With only a few rounds left, we need to reach an agreement soon to avoid losing everything."
