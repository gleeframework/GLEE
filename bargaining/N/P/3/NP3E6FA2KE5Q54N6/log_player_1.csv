Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going with a 60/40 split, hoping Bob sees the value in getting something now rather than risking a smaller share later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would have preferred a larger share, the inflation risk is too high. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me at least $3000, which is better than risking getting nothing if I reject and he then proposes a 90/10 split in his favor."
