Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You should have taken my previous offer. Inflation is killing your share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, the effects of inflation are starting to significantly hurt Bob. While Alice's offer isn't ideal, it's better than risking another round where the value diminishes further. 

Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  Each round sees a substantial decrease in the value of Bob's potential earnings. Waiting any longer will likely result in an even worse deal.
* **Alice's Strategy:** Alice knows about the inflation and is using it to her advantage. She's unlikely to offer anything significantly better.
* **Something is Better Than Nothing:** Accepting a less-than-ideal offer is better than risking getting nothing at all if the game continues and the value drops further."
