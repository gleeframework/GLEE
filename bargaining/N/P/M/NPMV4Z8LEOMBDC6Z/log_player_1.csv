"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
```

This is a very aggressive opening offer, but it takes advantage of the fact that Bob doesn't know about the inflation. Since I'm playing as Alice, I want to maximize my gains early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation hurts my gains,  Bob's offer is still much better than the outcome if we keep rejecting and risk getting nothing."
