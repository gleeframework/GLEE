Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be reasonable, Alice. This offer ensures you don't lose out too much to inflation in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 180000 
# Bob gain: 820000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a fairer share. This offer is still heavily in your favor, but it's closer to what I'd consider acceptable.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Accept this offer, or we both lose significantly more to inflation. This is your last chance for a decent share. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I'd prefer a larger share, the inflation is significantly hurting both of us. Accepting this offer ensures at least some gain for me, while rejecting it risks losing everything."
