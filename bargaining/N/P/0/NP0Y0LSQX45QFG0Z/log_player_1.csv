"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your generosity, but that split doesn't work for me. Let's be fairer - I propose a 65/35 split in my favor. Consider that the money loses value over time for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
