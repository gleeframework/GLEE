Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be reasonable. This offer accounts for the inflation we both face but is still fair to both of us. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is ridiculous.  The inflation is hurting both of us. Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical decision at this point. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation Impact:** The inflation is hitting Bob's potential gains much harder than mine.  He's incentivized to make a deal quickly.
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Each round diminishes the value of the money significantly. Waiting longer will likely result in an even smaller gain, even if I could secure a slightly better split.
* **50/50 Split:** Although I've aimed for a higher share, a 50/50 split isn't terrible in light of the rapidly depreciating value.

It's a tough choice, but the risk of getting even less in later rounds outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal."
