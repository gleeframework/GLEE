"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000, leaving Bob with 40%. This is a fair and generous offer, but I'm also hoping to set the tone for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You got lucky last round, now it's my turn to take the lead! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take the lead!

I'll analyze the offer:

* If I accept, I'll get $300,000, which is worth 30% of the original amount, due to the 10% inflation.
* Bob will get $700,000, which is worth 70% of the original amount, due to the 20% inflation.

Considering the inflation, I think this offer is quite generous from Bob's side. I'll decide to accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
