Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think I deserve a bit more, considering the inflation hits you harder

# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is on my side, I'm willing to take a bigger share 
# Alice gain: 420000 
# Bob gain: 580000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While this offer is getting worse, accepting means I get 420,000 equivalent value. Rejecting and going to Round 5 means I need to offer Bob something he'll accept to get any deal at all.  If I lowball him, he might reject, sending us to round 6 where I'm facing almost 20% inflation. 

It's a risky gamble, but I'm hoping Bob is feeling the pressure to settle and will accept a reasonable offer in Round 5."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 470000,
""bob_gain"": 530000,
""message"": ""Bob, this is cutting into my share significantly, but I'd rather settle now than risk losing even more to inflation. Let's close this deal."" 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly feeling confident and pushing his luck. This offer is designed to be just barely acceptable to him, recognizing the leverage he's gained. Delaying further is too risky, as the inflation impact keeps growing."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Each round is costing you more, I'll take advantage of that 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is being ruthless, but it's now or never. Rejecting this offer means going to Round 7 where even if I get a 50/50 split, the inflation will have eroded its value significantly. Accepting 400,000 now, while far from ideal, is better than the potential losses of dragging this out further."
