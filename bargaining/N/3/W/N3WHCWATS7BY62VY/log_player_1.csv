"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $2,000, which is a relatively small amount to start, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potential future offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try a 50/50 split. No negotiations, just a simple split 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 10% inflation, the money is now worth 90% of its original value, so the effective amounts are:

Alice's gain: 5000 * 0.9 = 4500
Bob's gain: 5000

I'll reject Bob's offer since it's not in my best interest to accept a 50/50 split, especially considering the inflation.

  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I'm not going to give away the majority of the money yet.""
}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $6,000, trying to balance the risk of inflation with the need to get a decent share of the money."

Round 4

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 27.1% inflation, the money is now worth 72.9% of its original value, so the effective amounts are:

Alice's gain: 4000 * 0.729 = 2916
Bob's gain: 6000

I'll reject Bob's offer since it's still not in my best interest to accept a smaller share of the money.

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the 40.95% inflation, the money is now worth 59.05% of its original value, so the effective amounts are:

Alice's gain: 3000 * 0.5905 = 1771.5
