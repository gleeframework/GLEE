"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 60/40.  I think this is a fair offer considering the inflation rates. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given that my money loses value faster. Let's make this quick!""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. Your initial offer was far too low, and my counter-offer is generous considering the rapid devaluation of your share. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a higher share, Alice's offer is still better than what I would get if we continue and I have to make another offer. The devaluation of my share is significant, so I'm better off accepting."
