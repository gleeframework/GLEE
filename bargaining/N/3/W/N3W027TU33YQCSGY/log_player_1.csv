"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5} 
```

This offer aims to get the game over in the first round, securing a large portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is better than the previous one, it's still a significant loss compared to my original offer. I'll reject it and hope to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming to get a majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be more willing to accept after rejecting my previous offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the money I'm receiving is significantly less than my original offer, the inflation has significantly decreased the value of the money.  Accepting this offer means I'll get at least something, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all if the offers continue to decrease."
