Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer of a 50/50 split, but with the inflation working against you, it would be more beneficial for both of us if I took a slightly larger share. This way, we both get something substantial. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60
