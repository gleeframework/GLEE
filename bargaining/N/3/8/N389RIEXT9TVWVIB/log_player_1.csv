"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept and we can split the money now!""
}
```

I'm offering to give Bob 400,000$ and keeping 600,000$ for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can split the money now!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to get a better deal 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 20% less, I need to be careful.

My current gain is 600,000$, and Bob's offer is 300,000$. I can do better than that. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 700,000$ for him and 300,000$ for me, I'll try to counter with a similar offer, but with a slightly higher share for myself.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, but I'll give you a slightly better deal 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on Bob's share! Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's offer is now 500,000$ for both of us, I'll accept this offer. It's a 50-50 split, and it's a good deal considering the inflation.
