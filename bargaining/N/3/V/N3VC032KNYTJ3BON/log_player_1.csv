"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a chance to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 70% of the initial $100, which is $70, and Bob gets 30%, which is $30. This is a fair starting point, and I'm giving Bob the opportunity to negotiate or accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, I'll give you a bit more than your offer, but next round it's your turn to be generous! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

Since the money is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

Alice gain: $40 * 0.95 = $38
Bob gain: $60 * 0.95 = $57

I'll accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
