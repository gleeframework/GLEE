Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see how Bob responds!  I'm confident with a generous 90/10 split, I'll be able to secure a good chunk of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, even after accounting for inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Although the money is worth less than in the first round,  I believe this is a fair offer given Bob's previous rejection. Let's see if we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still significantly worse than my initial proposal, even after accounting for inflation.  I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I believe I can still get a better split than this."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

Inflation is really starting to bite, but I'm going to propose a 50/50 split.  This is a fair offer given the circumstances.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept it."
