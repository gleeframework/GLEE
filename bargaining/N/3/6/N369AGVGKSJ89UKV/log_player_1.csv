"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""A fair starting point""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial 100$ and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point for the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bigger share if you accept now, before inflation hits 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not convinced by Bob's offer. He's still trying to take a significant portion of the money, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and wait for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""A slight adjustment, but still a good deal""}

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the remaining 100$ and Bob gets 45%. I'm making a slight adjustment to my previous offer, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you the majority, but I think it's time to wrap this up 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm starting to feel the pinch of inflation, and Bob's offer is looking more appealing. I'm willing to accept the majority share, 75%, to get this game over with and avoid further losses due to inflation."
