"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the majority, but you get a decent share. Accept this and we can both walk away with something. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, it's important to remember that the money is losing value for Bob with each passing round. It's better to see if Bob can get a better deal in the next round, even if it means risking getting a worse deal in the end."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 40,
""alice_gain"": 60,
""message"": ""I'm not happy with the previous offer. Let's split it more evenly. This is a fair deal for both of us, and we can avoid further rounds and the risk of losing value.""
