900000.0,100000.0,"Let's start with a fair split.  I'll take a bigger share, but you'll still get something. We can work out a better arrangement later on.",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, that's a pretty uneven split you proposed. Let's be more realistic. How about we go 60/40 in my favor? It accounts for the inflation disparity.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
550000.0,450000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to account for the inflation difference. This split is fairer considering the devaluation of our money. What do you think?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
350000.0,650000.0,"Alice, we need to find a compromise soon. I understand you want a larger share, but the inflation is hitting me harder. I'm proposing 65/35. It's a strong offer considering the circumstances.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
600000.0,400000.0,"Bob, we're running out of time. Let's be reasonable. This offer gives you a significant share, and it's the best we can do given the inflation rate.  We both need to accept some compromise, or we'll lose everything.",Alice,5,
,,,Bob,5,reject
380000.0,620000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. You're trying to backtrack on your previous offers, and we're running out of time. I'm sticking with a 62/38 split. Take it or leave it -  we both lose if this goes on.",Bob,6,
,,,Alice,6,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Bob, we're both losing out with each passing round. Let's end this stalemate and split the money evenly. This is the fairest solution considering the rapid inflation.",Alice,7,
