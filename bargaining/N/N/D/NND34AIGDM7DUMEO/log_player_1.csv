"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10. Since the money is worth less for him in future rounds, it's in his best interest to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's in my best interest to accept this offer. While I could potentially get more in the next round, the inflation will significantly reduce the value of any future gains for Bob. By accepting now, I guarantee myself a decent amount, and Bob gets a fair share as well."
