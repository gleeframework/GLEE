Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation:**  My gains are decreasing significantly with each round.  Even though Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's the best I can expect at this point.
* **Risk of Rejection:** If I reject, the next round I'll be making an offer with even lower value due to inflation.  It's likely Bob will reject my offer again. 
* **Potential Loss:**  By accepting, I secure a significant amount of the money, even if it's less than what I initially wanted. Rejecting could lead to a much worse outcome in the long run."
