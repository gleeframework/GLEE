"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a relatively fair split considering I'm starting the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think about it...

Round 3
