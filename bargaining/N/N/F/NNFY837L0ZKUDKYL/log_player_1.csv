"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe a 6:4 split is fairer, considering inflation will likely impact the value of the money more in later rounds. Let's agree to this now and avoid further potential losses. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
