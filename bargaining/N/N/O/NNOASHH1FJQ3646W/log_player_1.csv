"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly!""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $600,000 and Bob receives $400,000. I've included a message to Bob suggesting that this is a fair split, in the hopes that he'll accept the offer and we can conclude the game. Since it's the first round, the money is still worth its full value to both of us. I'm aiming to find a balance between getting a significant share and making an offer that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, given the potential for future inflation. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Although the value of the money has decreased due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. In the first round, I offered Bob $400,000, and now he's offering me the same amount, but it's worth 10% less due to inflation. Meanwhile, Bob's proposed share remains the same at $600,000, which is only 5% less valuable than in the first round. Considering the impact of inflation, I think I can make a more favorable proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's find a middle ground.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this offer, I'm proposing that I receive $550,000 and Bob receives $450,000. Given the decreasing value of money due to inflation, I've tried to find a middle ground that takes into account the reduced value of the money for both of us. Since Bob's previous offer was a 60/40 split in his favor, I'm hoping that this slightly more even split will be more appealing to him, considering the potential for further inflation in subsequent rounds."
