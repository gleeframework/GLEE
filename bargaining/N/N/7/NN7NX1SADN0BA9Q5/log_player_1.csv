"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll take 60% and you take 40%.""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share, but still willing to compromise. Your turn to decide! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, my gain of 3000 is now worth 2850 in real value.

I'm not too thrilled about the 7,000 for Bob, but I'm willing to compromise. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.

```
{

  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need to get a decent amount myself. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good amount for myself and giving Bob a decent share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 6000
