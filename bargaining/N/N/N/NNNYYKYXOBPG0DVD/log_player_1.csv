"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\nI am willing to offer Bob $400,000 and keep $600,000 for myself. My message to Bob is ""Let's split fairly"". I am trying to appear reasonable while also giving myself a slightly larger share, in the hopes that Bob will accept and we can avoid further rounds of negotiation (and the associated loss of value due to inflation)."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the inflation rates. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI will reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less to me now due to inflation, I believe I can still negotiate for a better deal. Accepting this offer would give Bob a significantly larger share, which I'm not willing to agree to yet. I'll make a new proposal in the next round to try to find a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $450,000 and keep $550,000 for myself. My message to Bob is ""Meet me in the middle"", as I'm trying to find a compromise between our previous offers. I'm taking into account the fact that the money is worth less to both of us now, but I still want to come out with a slightly larger share. By framing it as a compromise, I'm hoping Bob will see it as a reasonable offer and accept."
