"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can seal the deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $20, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair.  50/50 split is the most equitable, and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, which is $45.

I'm not sure if I want to accept this 50/50 split, considering I would be giving up $55 in today's value. I'd like to try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 81% of what it was in the first round, which is $64.80.

I'll make a new offer, trying to take advantage of the fact that Bob's gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""You said 50/50 is fair, but I think I deserve a bit more. Consider this compromise.""
}
```"
