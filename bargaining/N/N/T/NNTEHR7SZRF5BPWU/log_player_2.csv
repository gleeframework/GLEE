**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, but her offers are still not favorable. While her share is decreasing in value due to inflation, she's not acknowledging that in her proposals.  We need to push her towards a more even split, especially as we get closer to the halfway point."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 510000,
  ""alice_gain"": 490000,
  ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  Half the rounds are gone and your money is worth almost 35% less. I'm offering a very slight advantage for me, take it or leave it. This is my final offer.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to play hardball. By offering a 51/49 split and declaring it my final offer, I'm putting significant pressure on Alice. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:** We are past the halfway point, and the deadline is looming. 
* **Inflation:** Her share continues to plummet in value, making my offer increasingly attractive.
* **Ultimatum:** By declaring this my final offer, I force her to make a decision now with potentially severe consequences if she declines.

This strategy might seem risky, but the alternative is to continue haggling with an increasingly unreasonable Alice who doesn't seem to fully grasp the impact of the inflation on her potential gains."
