"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money with a 3:1 ratio. This way, we both get a fair share, but I'll take a larger portion to compensate for potential future risks due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 2500 
# Alice gain: 7500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 
I'm not comfortable with a 3:1 ratio. It's too lopsided in Alice's favor, even considering inflation. I'll try to negotiate a more balanced deal."
