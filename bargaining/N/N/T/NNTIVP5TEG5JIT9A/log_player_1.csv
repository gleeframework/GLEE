"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and simple!""
}
```

This is a straightforward proposal, where we both get $50. Now it's Bob's turn to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
