"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}

This offer gives me almost all the money, but it ensures that Bob will have some incentive to accept in the first round.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer to have more, this offer is still a substantial gain for me. It's better than risking going to the next round where the value of the money could decrease for me further."
