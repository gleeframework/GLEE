"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair considering the decreasing value of the money. It's a better deal for both of us than waiting and potentially losing more. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
