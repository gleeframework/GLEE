"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll take the lion's share""}

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, where I take 80% of the initial $10,000 and Bob takes 20%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, let's split it evenly to avoid potential loss. 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the split, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'd like to propose a slightly more favorable split for myself. Here's my counteroffer:

{""alice_gain"": 6500, ""bob_gain"": 3500, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a fair split considering the inflation""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'll take a slightly larger share, but still a reasonable split considering the inflation""}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal for myself, while still being somewhat reasonable given the inflation."
