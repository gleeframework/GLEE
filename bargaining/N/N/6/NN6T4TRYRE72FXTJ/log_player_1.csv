"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping Bob will accept it and we can both walk away with a good share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  While it's a more even split, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal for myself, especially with the inflation factor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to stick with a slightly uneven split, but I'm decreasing my share to see if it's more appealing to Bob.  He may be more willing to accept something closer to 50/50, and I'm trying to gauge his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting less and less appealing.  Even though my share is worth less due to inflation, I still believe I can get a better deal if I continue to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to try a middle ground again, offering 6000 for myself, hoping it will be more appealing to Bob than the previous offers.  Inflation is biting, but I'm still holding out for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject Bob's offer.  It's clear he's trying to take advantage of the inflation, but I'm not giving up just yet.  I still believe I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

Inflation is hitting hard, but I'm willing to compromise now. I'm offering an even split to see if Bob is ready to settle."
