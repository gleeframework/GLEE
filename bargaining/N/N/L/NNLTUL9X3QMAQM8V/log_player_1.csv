  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll give you a good deal!""

I'm offering Bob 40% of the money, which is a generous offer considering the initial amount is 100$. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 60/40 in my favor, a fair trade for the next round. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 20% less, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not too thrilled about giving him 60% of the money. However, I'm willing to make a concession to move the game forward.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 50, but not 60, let's try to find a better deal""
}
```
