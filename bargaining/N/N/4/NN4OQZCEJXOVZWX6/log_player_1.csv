"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 400000, ""bob_gain"": 600000}

I'm proposing that I get 400,000 and Bob gets 600,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 280000 
# Bob gain: 720000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not impressed with Bob's offer. I'll reject it and make a new proposal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll think of a new offer for the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000}

I'm proposing that I get 450,000 and Bob gets 550,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 352000 
# Bob gain: 648000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection!

I'll think carefully about this offer. Considering the decreasing value of the money due to inflation, I'll decide to accept this offer.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll take the 352,000 and Bob can have the 648,000. It's not the best deal, but it's better than continuing to negotiate and risking even less value in the future."
