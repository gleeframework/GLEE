Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The longer this takes, the less we both get. This offer is still in your favor considering the inflation rate. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but you're not giving me much choice.  This is my final offer above 50%.  Take it or let's see what happens. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting increasingly aggressive, and her ""final offer"" language suggests she's feeling the pressure of the shrinking pot. While her offer is still above 50%, it's a significant drop from her previous offers. I believe I can push for a more favorable outcome, knowing that Alice is getting hit harder by the inflation."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, enough is enough. This 50/50 split is the definition of fair.  Take it before the inflation eats away even more of your potential winnings.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm now offering a perfectly even split. This serves a few purposes:

* **Strong Position:** It puts me in a morally strong position. It's hard to argue against a 50/50 split in a negotiation like this.
* **Pressure on Alice:**  It highlights how much she's losing by continuing to decline.
* **Limited Risk:** While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting a 50/50 split now ensures I get something, and it's still better than what Alice has been offering."
