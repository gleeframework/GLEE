"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly, Bob. Fair is fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for me in each subsequent round, I have an incentive to end the game as soon as possible to minimize losses due to inflation. However, accepting the first offer without considering potential better offers might not be optimal. I'll reject the first offer to see if I can get a better deal in the next round, despite knowing that the total value of the money decreases for me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'd like a bit more. Let's adjust the split.""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to offer a division where I receive $60 and Alice receives $40. Given the impact of inflation on my potential earnings, I believe this adjustment is reasonable. I'm hoping Alice will consider the effects of inflation on my end and accept this offer to conclude the game sooner rather than later."
