"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which seems fair to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share would be worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'd be gaining $4500 in value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
