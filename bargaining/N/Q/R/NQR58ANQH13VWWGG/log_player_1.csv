"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a pretty straightforward offer. I want the majority of the money, but I'm leaving Bob with a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, the money is worth less with each round. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure I get something out of this game."
