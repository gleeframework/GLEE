"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a decent amount to keep the game interesting.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $800,000 and Bob gets $200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's be realistic about the value of the money! 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I think I'm getting a very unfair deal. I'd like to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```

  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""You're being a bit too greedy, let's meet in the middle and make a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a more balanced split, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're still being too soft on me, I'm willing to make a more aggressive offer 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is getting more aggressive. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
