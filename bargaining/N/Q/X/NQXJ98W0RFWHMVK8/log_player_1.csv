Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to split the money fairly, but I'm also aware of the time constraint. Let's both get a good amount before the money depreciates too much. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting this offer. While it's better than the first round, it's still heavily skewed in Bob's favor. The time constraint is a factor, but I'm willing to take a few more rounds to try and negotiate a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
