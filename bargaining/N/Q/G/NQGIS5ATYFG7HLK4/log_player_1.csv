Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1. Since inflation doesn't affect me in this round, I want to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
