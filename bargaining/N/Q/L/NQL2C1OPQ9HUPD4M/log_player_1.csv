Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a generous offer, hoping to get this done quickly.  I'm taking 90% and leaving 10% for Bob.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

```

While I'd prefer to get more, I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer with inflation.  It's better to take half now than risk getting nothing."
