"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
 
I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure it's a good starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject this offer. It's the opposite of my initial proposal, and even though the value of the money has decreased, I'm not willing to take such a small portion.  I'll try to negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm going to offer a split of 80/20 in my favor.  The value of the money has decreased, but I'm still hoping for a better deal than what Bob offered.  I'm willing to give him a bit more than before, but I'm still aiming for the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm rejecting this offer again. Even though the value of the money has decreased significantly, I'm still hoping for a better deal than what Bob is offering.  I'm not going to settle for such a small portion of the money, especially since he's getting a much larger share.  I'll try to negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm going to offer a 70/30 split in my favor.  This is a compromise, as I'm giving Bob a larger share than before, but the value of the money has dropped significantly, so I need to ensure I still get a decent amount.  Hopefully, he'll be more willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still rejecting this offer.  It's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting, but I'm still hopeful that I can get a better deal.  The value of the money is continuing to decline, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small portion of the money.  I'll try to negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to offer a 60/40 split in my favor.  It's a risky move, as the value of the money is quickly decreasing, but I'm still trying to get a fair share.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that we're both losing money with each passing round, and he'll be willing to accept a compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm still rejecting this offer. While the value of the money has decreased significantly, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'm not willing to accept a 40/60 split in Bob's favor.  I'll try to negotiate something better in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split. With the value of the money decreasing so rapidly, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue rejecting offers. I'm willing to give up more of my potential share to reach an agreement and avoid getting nothing.  Hopefully, Bob will finally accept a fair compromise."
