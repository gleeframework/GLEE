"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You went with a 28/72 split. I'll try to do better than that. This is a 80/20 split, but I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share to make up for the initial rejection. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","{
