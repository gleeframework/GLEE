"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60% and you take 40%""

Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to get more. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, I'd rather not accept a worse deal.
