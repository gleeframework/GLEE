Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We're both losing money, let's split it and be done. I'll take 57, you take 43, it's my final reasonable offer.

# Bob gain: 57

This is a tough spot.  Ideally, I'd want more, but Bob seems unlikely to budge and the money is rapidly losing value. Accepting a 43/57 split now is better than getting nothing in a few more rounds."
