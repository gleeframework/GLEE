"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. No need to negotiate.""
}
```

This way, we both get $5,000 and the game ends here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but it's still a good deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, $4000 is equivalent to $4,000 / 0.95 = $4211.58 in the first round. That's a decent offer, but I'm not sure if I should take it.

I'll reject this offer for now and see if I can do better in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I still want to be fair.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, hoping to get a better deal than what he offered me in the previous round."
