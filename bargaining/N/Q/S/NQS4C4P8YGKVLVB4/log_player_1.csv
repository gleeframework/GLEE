I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, giving myself 90% of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if he doesn't, we'll see what happens in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Bob is playing a dangerous game!  While his offer is tempting at first glance, I'm not going to let him take 90% of the money. I'm hoping that he will realize he needs to negotiate in good faith if he wants to get any of the money at all.  We'll see what happens in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split. This is a fair and reasonable offer, and I hope Bob will finally accept."
