"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: How about we switch it around?  Time is running out. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
Alice's offer is now the same as Bob's previous offer, but with the value decreased due to inflation. It's better to take a slightly smaller amount now than risk getting even less in future rounds.
