"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money is worth 5% less now, I'd rather not accept an offer that gives me a smaller amount than the one I proposed in the first round, adjusted for inflation. But, I also don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller amount. I'll accept Bob's offer.
