"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the fact that we both lose money over time, but your loss is significantly higher each round. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Alice's offer seems reasonable at first glance, the fact that my losses are significantly higher each round makes this a risky proposition. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 450000, ""alice_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I understand your concerns about our losses, but I need a larger share to compensate for my higher inflation rate. This offer still gives you a significant portion, and I believe it's a fairer split considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but my previous offer was already generous considering the inflation. I'm willing to adjust slightly, but this has to be a fair deal for both of us. Time is literally money in this game. 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible choice. My losses are substantial, and each round increases the risk.  I'm getting a decent portion and at least I'm guaranteed to get something."
