"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a very aggressive offer, taking 99% of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will be hesitant to reject and risk losing almost everything in the next round, especially considering the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a much fairer offer, and it's in my best interest to accept. While the inflation has decreased the value of the money, it's still a significant gain, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round."
