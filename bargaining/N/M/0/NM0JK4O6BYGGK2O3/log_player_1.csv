"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take a slightly smaller share to start""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share to start, hoping to create a sense of fairness and set a precedent for the rest of the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, no need to start too aggressively 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll have to adjust my calculations.

Since Bob's offer is to meet in the middle, I'll consider it a relatively fair proposal. However, I'd like to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the loss in value due to inflation.

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll counter with a slightly higher share, let's see if you'll meet me halfway""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer, taking into account the 5% decrease in value due to inflation:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher share than before, hoping to get a better deal while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more to make up for the inflation, but I'm still trying to get a fair share 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate increasing, I'll have to be more cautious with my decision. Considering the offers so far, Bob seems to be willing to compromise, but I still want to get a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer from round 4 and make a new proposal, taking into account the increased inflation rate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll try to get a bit more, the inflation is eating into my share""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate continuing to rise, I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer to compensate for the loss in value. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I'm getting a bit worried about the inflation, I need a bigger share to keep up""
}
```

I'm offering a slightly higher share than before, hoping to get a better deal before the value of the money continues to decrease."

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: I'm not going to give in to the inflation, I need a bigger share to keep up with the reduced value of money 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a larger share. However, I'm not willing to give in that easily.

Considering the current state of the game, I'll reject Bob's offer from round 6 and make a new proposal, taking into account the increasing inflation rate.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, I need a bigger share to keep up with the inflation""
}
```"

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate continuing to rise, I'll have to be even more aggressive in my offer. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm not going to let the inflation eat into my share, I need a bigger share now""
}
```
