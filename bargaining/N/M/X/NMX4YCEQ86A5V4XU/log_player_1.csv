I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting 6,000 and Bob getting 4,000. I think this is a good starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's try a 50-50 split, it's a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 50-50 split, but I don't want to risk going to the next round with the money losing even more value due to inflation. I'll accept Bob's offer for now.
