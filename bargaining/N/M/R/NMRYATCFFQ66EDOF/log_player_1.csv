"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

I'm offering to take 70% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with $30."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 20% less, so I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since Bob's gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer for round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 40% of its original value due to inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage to make up for it. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the money is worth 48.8% less than in the first round, I need to be cautious. However, Bob's offer is a bit more generous than before, and I'm not sure if I should wait for a better offer.

I'll accept Bob's offer for round 4.
