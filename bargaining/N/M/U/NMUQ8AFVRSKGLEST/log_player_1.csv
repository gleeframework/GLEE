I propose to take 99 dollars and give Bob 1 dollar.  Let's see if he agrees."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 

I'm going to stick with a similar strategy, but slightly adjust the split to see if Bob is willing to compromise. I'll offer 90 dollars for myself and 10 dollars for Bob."
