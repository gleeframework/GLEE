Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking, and this is my final offer. Let's wrap this up!

# Bob gain: 550000

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, accepting Bob's offer in Round 4 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Inflation's Impact on Bob:** Inflation is severely devaluing the money for Bob with each passing round.  He's motivated to close the deal quickly. 
* **My Leverage Decreases:**  While my money isn't devalued by inflation, my leverage in the negotiation decreases with each round Bob rejects. He knows I'm feeling the pressure to settle.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance Bob might offer even less in the next round, or the game might end with no deal and we both get nothing. 

Accepting 450,000 is better than risking a worse outcome in later rounds."
