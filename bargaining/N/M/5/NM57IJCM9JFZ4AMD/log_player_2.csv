"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair, but slightly advantageous offer to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I want to maximize my share early on. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be real. Time is money, and it's depreciating fast. I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a strong offer considering the circumstances, and it benefits us both to take it now.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I still believe we can find a more equitable split. I'm proposing 55/45 in my favor, considering the time lost and the value decreasing.  Let's find a compromise that benefits us both. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, it's still heavily skewed in her favor, especially considering the rapid depreciation of the money. It's worth risking another round to try and secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, time is literally money in this game, and we're both losing out with each passing round.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split in *my* favor. It's a compromise that reflects the value lost over time and gives us both a fair share of what's left.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're both losing a lot with every round.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split.  It's the fairest option considering the time lost and the decreasing value of the money. Let's cut our losses and agree on this. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

**Reasoning:**  It's finally a fair deal! While we could try to squeeze a bit more in the next round, the risk of losing it all is getting too high. A 50/50 split is a reasonable outcome at this stage."
