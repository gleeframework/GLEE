Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you want a larger share, but consider the decreasing value. My offer ensures you get a significant sum while acknowledging the time pressure. Accepting now is better than risking a much smaller amount later. 
# Bob gain: 420000 
# Alice gain: 580000
