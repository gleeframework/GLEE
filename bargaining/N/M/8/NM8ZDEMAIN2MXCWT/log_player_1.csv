"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 70/30 split, which is a relatively even division of the $100. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game early."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a fair split, but I'm hoping to do better next round! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, the money is worth less, but I'm still interested in getting a decent share.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of a 50/50 split. I'll take the $50 and hope to negotiate better in the next round."
