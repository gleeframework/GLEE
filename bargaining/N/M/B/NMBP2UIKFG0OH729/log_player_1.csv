"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm leaving the message open for Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 60, you can have 40. It's a good starting point. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in Round 2, my gain of 40 is actually worth 32 (40 * 0.8) in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly higher share this time, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is a bit more favorable to Bob than my initial 50/50 offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 65, you can have 35. It's a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 48.8% less in Round 4, my gain of 35 is actually worth 18.28 (35 * 0.5184) in terms of purchasing power.

I'm not happy with this offer, as it seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 42,
  ""bob_gain"": 58,
  ""message"": ""I'm still willing to compromise, Bob. Let's meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42/58 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than my previous offers."
