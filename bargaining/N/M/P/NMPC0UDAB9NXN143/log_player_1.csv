I propose to take $9,000 and give Bob $1,000. This is a good starting point, and I hope he accepts it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This is a huge power shift in Bob's favor. I'm going to reject this and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

I'm offering a more even split of $6,000 for me and $4,000 for Bob. While Bob has a better deal from the last round, I hope this is a more reasonable offer that considers the effects of inflation on both of us."
