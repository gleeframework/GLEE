"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}
```

This way, we both get a relatively equal share of the money, and I get a slight edge since I'm making the first offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a fair share, but I'm not giving up too much 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me, I can still think in terms of the original $10,000. However, I need to consider that the money Bob gains is worth 5% less.

In this case, Bob's offer is essentially giving me $5,000 and taking $4,950 (95% of $5,200, which is 5% less than $5,500, the amount I would get if we were splitting the original $10,000).

I'll accept this offer, since I'm getting a good share and it's a fair deal considering the inflation.
