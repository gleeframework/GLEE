**Reasoning:**

Alice is stubbornly sticking close to her initial offer, even though the value is decreasing for me with each round.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal. The risk of getting nothing at the end is growing, but it's a risk I'm willing to take for a better outcome."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Okay Alice, let's be real.  The clock is ticking and this is the most fair I can go.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to show Alice I'm serious. Offering a 50/50 split is fair, especially given the inflation working against me.  This might be my last chance to secure a reasonable deal before the shrinking pot makes it pointless to continue."
