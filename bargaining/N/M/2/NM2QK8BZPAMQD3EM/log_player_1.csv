Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I was feeling generous yesterday, but today is a new day. This offer reflects the time-value of money. Take it before it shrinks further! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, the clock is ticking, and with every tick, the value of this deal diminishes. I'm offering you a larger share than before, but my patience is wearing thin along with the value of these dollars! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting increasingly desperate, but his offers are still not reflecting the true cost of time in this scenario.  The longer this goes on, the more the power shifts to me. I'm willing to wait for a better offer."
