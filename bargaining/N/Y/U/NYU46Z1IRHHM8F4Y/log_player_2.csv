"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split fairly, accounting for future losses due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 4875 
# Alice gain: 5125 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While the offer appears fair, it's crucial to remember that inflation will significantly impact Bob's share. By rejecting, Bob can become the proposer in the next round and potentially secure a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5250,
""alice_gain"": 4750,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a more equitable split, taking inflation into account. Let's make this a win-win situation!""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but we need to find a balance.  This offer is a slight adjustment to account for the decreasing value over time. 
# Bob gain: 4800 
# Alice gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is a slight improvement from the first round, the inflation rate is still significantly impacting Bob's share. Continuing to reject will hopefully lead to an offer more favorable to Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5300,
""alice_gain"": 4700,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a slight increase to my previous offer.  Let's work together to find a solution that's fair to both of us, given the ongoing inflation.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is running out. This offer is a compromise, acknowledging the time pressure and the impact of inflation on your share. 
# Bob gain: 4750 
# Alice gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Although time is running out, and Alice's offer is slightly better than the previous round, it's still not a fair split considering the significant inflation impact on Bob's share.  Rejecting allows for another round where Bob might get a better offer or be able to propose a better one himself."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5400,
""alice_gain"": 4600,
""message"": ""Alice, we're approaching the halfway point. I'm offering a slight increase again, showing my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's find a solution that acknowledges the inflation and gives us both a fair share.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to settle this soon. I'm increasing my offer again, reflecting the urgency and the impact inflation has on your share. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Although Alice's offer is a slight improvement, the inflation is still severely impacting Bob's share. Rejecting this offer gives Bob another chance to propose a more favorable split, or potentially secure a better counter-offer from Alice."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, but we can still find a solution.  I'm increasing my offer again, hoping to find a compromise that's fair to both of us.  Let's work together to reach an agreement before the inflation wipes out any remaining value."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting critical. We're down to the wire.  This offer is a significant move on my part, recognizing the time pressure and the considerable effect inflation has had on your potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is a substantial improvement from her previous offer,  it's still significantly below what Bob could have earned with a favorable split in the earlier rounds. With only a few rounds left, it's worth the risk of rejecting in hopes of securing a more equitable outcome in the remaining rounds."

Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{

""alice_gain"": 4400,
""message"": ""Alice, we're in the final stretch.  This is my last offer.  It's a considerable increase, reflecting the urgency of the situation.  Let's find a solution that acknowledges the inflation and provides both of us with a decent share.  Otherwise, we risk losing everything.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.13% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is my final offer. Take it or leave it.  We're almost out of time, and I'm taking a significant cut to ensure we both get something. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Alice's offer is a significant move, with only one round remaining, Bob should reject and see if he can get a better offer in the final round. There's still a chance that Alice might increase her offer again, or Bob might be able to secure a better deal by making a final proposal. It's a risky strategy, but with so much at stake, it's worth a gamble."
