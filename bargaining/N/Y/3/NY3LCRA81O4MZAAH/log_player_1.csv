I propose a 90/10 split in my favor.  While I'm willing to share, I want to ensure I get the most out of the initial round, as the money will be worth less in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm lowering my offer to 80/20.  While Bob's counter-offer was significantly in his favor, I believe a 80/20 split is fairer given the diminishing value of the money.  I'm still aiming for the majority, but recognizing the need for compromise."
