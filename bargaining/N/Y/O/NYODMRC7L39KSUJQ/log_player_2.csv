Round 5

# Alice's message: I'm still willing to compromise, but I won't go too low 
# Bob gain: 44 
# Alice gain: 56 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to a more even split, the inflation is working heavily in my favor.  She's losing value rapidly with each round. I'm willing to push my luck a bit further to see if I can secure a better deal."

# Alice's message: I'll try to meet you halfway, but I'm running out of room to maneuver 
# Bob gain: 46 
# Alice gain: 54 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure, and rightfully so. Her potential gains are plummeting. While her offer is getting more tempting, I believe I can squeeze out a bit more before she gets truly desperate."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 70,

Round 9
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 83.22% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll give up a bit more, but I'm not going to give in completely 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I need to start being realistic. While I'd love to push for more, Alice is finally nearing the point where accepting anything less than half is a terrible deal for her, even with inflation.  If I push further, she's likely to gamble on a desperate offer in the later rounds, and I risk getting nothing. Taking a slight advantage now is better than the possibility of walking away empty-handed."
