Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

While I would prefer a more even split, the inflation is significantly hurting my share. It's better to accept this offer and get something rather than risk getting nothing at all in the next round."
