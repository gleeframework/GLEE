Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a middle ground. This offer is more balanced, considering the inflation is hitting me harder than you. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of inflation more strongly than Bob, and she's likely to become increasingly willing to accept a smaller share as time goes on. While her offer is getting closer to a more reasonable split, Bob still has some leverage and time to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Alice, we need to reach an agreement soon. This is my final offer, let's close the deal and avoid losing more to inflation.""}"
