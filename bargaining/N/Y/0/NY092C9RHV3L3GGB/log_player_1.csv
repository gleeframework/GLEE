"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here is my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, and I'll take the remaining 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm considering the offer...

Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too thrilled about the offer. However, it's a decent proposal, and I don't want to risk going to the next round.

I'll accept the offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
