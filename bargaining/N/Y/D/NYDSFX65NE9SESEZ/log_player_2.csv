"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
Let's see what Alice offers next.  While it's tempting to take $4000, I'm curious to see if I can get more, especially with the inflation factor in play."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going to propose a split that favors me slightly. I figure since Alice proposed a 60/40 split, I can offer a 60/40 split in my favor. I'm hoping this will encourage her to accept, as I'm confident I can get a better deal if we continue."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice is now offering a 54/46 split, which is worse than her initial offer.  I'm going to reject this and see if I can get her to offer me a better deal.  The inflation is starting to hurt, but I think I can still get a better deal if I hold out."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500}
```

Since the inflation is starting to bite, I'm going to offer Alice a slightly less favorable deal than my previous offer. This is a risky move, but if I can get Alice to accept before the inflation really kicks in, I'll still be in a good position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 4816 
# Alice gain: 5184 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is getting worse, but I'm going to hold out for a better deal. The inflation is hitting hard, but I'm confident I can get a better outcome if I keep playing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm going back to my original offer, hoping that Alice will realize the inflation is working against her and accept a deal closer to my initial proposal.  I'm not sure how much she knows about the inflation, but I'm hoping to capitalize on that uncertainty."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round.

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6500, ""alice_gain"": 3500}
```

I'm going to try to push for a more favorable split for myself. I'm increasing my desired share to 65%, hoping that the pressure of the increasing inflation will motivate Alice to accept. This is a risky move, but I believe that I can secure a better deal than Alice's previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 56.95% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 5884.16 
# Alice gain: 4115.84 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous offer, but I'm still not satisfied with the split. I'm going to hold out for a better deal. The inflation is a big concern, but I believe that I can get a more favorable outcome if I continue playing."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 9.
Round 10
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000}
```

The inflation is hitting hard, but I need to get a good deal quickly.  I'm going to push for a 70/30 split in my favor, hoping that Alice will recognize that we're running out of time and accept my offer. This is a bold move, but I think I have a chance to get a better deal than Alice's previous offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 10.

Round 11
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 65.13% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 6295.52 
# Alice gain: 3704.48 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

The inflation is getting out of control, and with only two rounds left, the risk of getting nothing is too high. While it's not ideal, I'm going to accept Alice's offer. I'm still getting a decent share of the money, and it's better than risking everything for a slightly better deal that might not materialize."
