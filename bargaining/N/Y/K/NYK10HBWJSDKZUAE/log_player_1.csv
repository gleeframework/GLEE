Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

Let's see if Bob takes my generous offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd love to keep more, accepting this offer guarantees me $5000, while rejecting could result in me getting nothing at all.  It's a risky gamble to hope for a better offer, especially since inflation is in effect."
