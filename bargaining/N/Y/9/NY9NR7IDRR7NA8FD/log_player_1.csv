"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I think this is a fair starting point.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm willing to negotiate!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a decent share, but I think I deserve more since the money is worth less to me due to inflation 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I need to adjust my strategy.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I think you're getting a bit too generous, considering the inflation. I'd like to propose a new offer.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the money is worth 40% less for me now (20% less than the previous round, and 20% less than the initial amount), I'll try to be more aggressive with my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I think we can do better than this. I'm willing to give you a decent share, but I need to get a fair deal for myself.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise and meet you in the middle, considering the effects of inflation 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 48.8% less for me and 27.1% less for Bob, I think we're getting close to the point where we should accept a compromise. Meeting in the middle seems like a reasonable solution, considering the effects of inflation. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""I think we've reached a fair deal. Let's split it down the middle.""
}
```"
