"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer to Bob. I want to see if he's willing to accept a deal early on, especially considering the inflation will affect his share more than mine in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still not a good deal for me considering the inflation. I'm confident I can get a better deal if we continue the game."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm raising my share slightly, hoping Bob will see that continuing to reject offers will only make his share shrink further due to the higher inflation rate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While Bob's offer isn't ideal, it's the best I can get considering the inflation. Continuing to reject offers would only make his share shrink further, leaving me with less in the end. It's time to take what I can get."
