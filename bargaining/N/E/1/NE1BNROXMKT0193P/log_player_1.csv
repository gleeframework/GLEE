Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was quite bold! Let's be more realistic. I propose a 70/30 split in my favor.  Time is money, and each round costs us both. Do you agree? 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
