"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it in a way that we both get a significant amount. I'm willing to give you 4000, which is a considerable sum, but I think I deserve a bit more for being patient and taking the risk of going to the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
