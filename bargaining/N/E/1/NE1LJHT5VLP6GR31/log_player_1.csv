"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
``` 

I propose a 50/50 split. It's a fair starting point and leaves room for negotiation in future rounds if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}
``` 

I'm offering a slightly higher share for myself to compensate for the inflation. This is still a reasonable split considering Bob's last offer and the fact that I'll be losing 10% more on my earnings in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm losing a significant portion of my earnings due to inflation, accepting this offer is the best option at this point. It guarantees me some money, and rejecting it could lead to an even worse deal in the next round."
