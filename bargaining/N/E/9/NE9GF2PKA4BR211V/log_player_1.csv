"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
 
I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I think this is fair, given that I'm only taking a 10% cut. I'm hoping Bob will agree to this to avoid the risk of inflation hurting his potential gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Even with the inflation, taking a 75/25 split in his favor feels too steep. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept something so lopsided."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm offering a 80/20 split.  I'm willing to compromise, but I still feel a 75/25 split is too much in Bob's favor, especially after the inflation we've seen."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While the inflation has taken a toll, a 70/30 split is still too far from my ideal.  I'm willing to take a slightly lower share, but I won't settle for anything less than a 60/40 split in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 65, ""bob_gain"": 35}
```

I'm offering a 65/35 split.  I'm  aware of the increasing inflation and trying to be reasonable.  I believe this offer is fair, considering the circumstances."
