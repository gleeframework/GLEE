{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,

}

I'm offering Bob a small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a smaller share, but it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, my gain of 20 is actually worth 18 now.

I'm not too thrilled with this offer, but I'll consider it. I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'll reject this offer.
