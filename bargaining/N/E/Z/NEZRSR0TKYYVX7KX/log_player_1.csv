"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair and reasonable start.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering I don't know how the inflation will affect Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You wanted 60-40, I'll meet you in the middle 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a more favorable deal for himself.

I'll consider the offer and decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because, although it's a 50-50 split, the value of the money I gain is still 10% less than in the first round, and I'm not sure how the inflation is affecting Bob's gain. I'd like to try to negotiate further to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'll compromise, but I need a better deal to account for the inflation.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to a 45-55 split, trying to get a slightly better deal for myself while still being open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I still think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is still trying to negotiate a better deal for himself.

Considering the effect of inflation, I'll reevaluate the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm accepting this offer because, although it's still a 55-45 split, the value of the money I gain is worth significantly less than in the first round, and I'm not sure how much more I can negotiate without risking getting a worse deal."
