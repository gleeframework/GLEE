"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20. This leaves me with $80."

Round 2

# Bob's message: I'll take a fair share, but let's see if we can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $50 is now worth $40.
