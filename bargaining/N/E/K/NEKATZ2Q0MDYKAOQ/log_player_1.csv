"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept my generous offer and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $600,000 and Bob gets $400,000. This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave Bob with a decent amount. The message is a gentle nudge to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
