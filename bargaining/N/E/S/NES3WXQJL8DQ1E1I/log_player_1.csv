Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can do better than this. You're not leaving me with much to work with. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While the money is worth less, it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting a worse offer in the next round. It's also important to note that Bob seems to be playing strategically and is willing to negotiate. Accepting this offer ensures a deal and avoids further potential losses."
