"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'm actually getting a better deal than I initially proposed. However, I'm still getting less than 50% of the total amount. I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering that the money is worth 20% less than in the first round, and Bob's offer in round 2 was already taking this into account, I'll make a slightly more aggressive offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm offering a 55-45 split, hoping to get a better deal this time around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Another rejection! Okay, let's analyze Bob's new offer. Considering that the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and the money Bob gains is worth even less than in the previous round, I'm actually getting a better deal than in the previous round. However, I'm still not getting the majority of the money. I'll decide to accept this offer.
