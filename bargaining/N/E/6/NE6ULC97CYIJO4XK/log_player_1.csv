"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll take the majority but it's a good starting point""}

I'm proposing that I take 700,000 and Bob takes 300,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and it gives me a slight advantage, but still leaves Bob with a decent amount."
