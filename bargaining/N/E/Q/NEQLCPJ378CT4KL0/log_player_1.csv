"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

This way, I get a decent share of the money, and Bob still gets a fair amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking its toll. My share is worth 10% less than in the first round, and Bob's is worth 5% less.

I'll have to think carefully... I don't want to give up too much more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Inflation is eating away at the value of the money, and I need to make a new offer.

Here's my next proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

I'm trying to get a slightly better share, but still be reasonable given the inflation."
