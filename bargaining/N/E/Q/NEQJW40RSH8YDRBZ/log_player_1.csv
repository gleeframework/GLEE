"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

This way, I'll get 90% of the initial amount, and Bob will get 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, Bob's offer is quite generous. I'll accept it.
