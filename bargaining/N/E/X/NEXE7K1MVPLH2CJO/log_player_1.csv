"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle. Your turn to propose!""

I'm offering to take $6,000 and leave $4,000 for Bob. This is a fair and reasonable split, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
