"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a decent share, let's split the difference!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a generous share, considering the final round is still far away. I'll keep the majority of the money, but I'm willing to give Bob a reasonable amount to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  We both get a good amount and can avoid the risk of inflation. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll consider Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better. Splitting it evenly means I'll get $500,000, which is less than what I initially offered Bob in the first round. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Inflation is taking its toll, and the money is worth 20% less than in the previous round. Considering this, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 720000,
  ""bob_gain"": 280000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a decent amount considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm keeping a larger share, but I'm giving Bob a smaller amount to reflect the reduced value of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. This offer gives you a majority, but still ensures we both get a significant amount. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a big hit on the money's value. Considering the reduced value, I'll have to reassess the offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. With the money being worth significantly less, I'm willing to accept a smaller share to avoid risking even more loss in future rounds. $600,000 is a decent amount, and I think it's a reasonable compromise."
