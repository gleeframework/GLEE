"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a fair and straightforward way to divide the $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a good chunk, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 30% gain for Bob, but I'm willing to consider it. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I think I can do better than 30%. I'll try to negotiate or make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm trying to find a middle ground by offering Bob a slightly smaller share, while still keeping a decent chunk for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 25% gain for Bob, but considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I think this might be a decent offer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a relatively fair split considering the reduced value of the money. I'm not sure I can do better in the next round, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a worse offer."
