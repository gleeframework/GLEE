"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take the low offer, or we'll negotiate further 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to take advantage of the inflation to get a bigger share!

I'll reject his offer for now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll wait for his next offer, hoping to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Now it's my turn again! Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Compromise, I'll give you a smaller share, but I'm still not going for 70/30""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a good share and not giving Bob too much. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, don't let it go to zero! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's trying to appeal to my sense of self-preservation!

I'll think about it for a moment... Okay, I'll accept this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

It's not the best deal for me, but I don't want to risk going to zero, and Bob's offer is a reasonable compromise."
