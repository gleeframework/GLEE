"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's divide fairly""}\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself, with a message suggesting a fair division. Since there's no inflation in the first round, this offer seems reasonable, and it gives Bob a substantial amount while also ensuring I get a slightly larger share. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the money is worth less to you each round. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth 20% less to me in this round, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds. Accepting this offer would mean I get $4000, which, after the 20% reduction, is worth $3200, while Bob gets $6000. I think I can do better than that! Let's proceed to the next round and see what happens."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's find a middle ground""}\n\nIn this round, I'll offer Bob $4500 and keep $5500 for myself. Considering the inflation, my $5500 is actually worth $4400, but I'm trying to find a middle ground that Bob might accept. I'm hoping that by giving Bob a slightly larger share than last time, he might be more willing to accept this offer and end the game. Let's see how Bob responds!"
