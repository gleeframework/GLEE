"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 

This is a fair offer to start with, giving me a good chunk of the money and leaving Bob with a smaller but still significant portion. I want to see how he responds, and then adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I reject this offer.  While it offers me a significant amount, the inflation is starting to affect Bob's share.  By rejecting, I can make a counter-offer and potentially get a better deal for myself, especially since Bob is losing value on his share each round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
``` 

This is a counter-offer that still gives Bob a significant share, but allows me to gain a bigger portion of the money. I'm taking advantage of the inflation on Bob's side to try and secure a better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I accept this offer.  While it's not my ideal outcome, the inflation is starting to take a toll on Bob's share.  By accepting, I guarantee myself a decent sum of money while Bob's share keeps decreasing.  There's a risk of him rejecting and the game continuing, but with each round, his offer will likely be less attractive, so it's in my best interest to secure this deal."
