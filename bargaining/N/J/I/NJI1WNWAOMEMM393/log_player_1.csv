"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my initial offer:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000
}

I'm offering to take 90% of the initial $1,000,000 and leaving Bob with 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of 200,000 is now worth 95% of its original value, which is 190,000.

I will accept Bob's offer.
