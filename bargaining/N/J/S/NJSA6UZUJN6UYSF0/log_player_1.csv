"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the money, leaving Bob with 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, given the unequal inflation rates. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your turn to be a bit more generous. This is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer in JSON format:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 580000,
  ""bob_gain"": 420000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, last chance""
}
```

I've increased Bob's share slightly, but I'm still being cautious given the inflation rates. This is my attempt to find a mutually acceptable middle ground. Let's see if Bob bites!"
