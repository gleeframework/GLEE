"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, I'll get the bigger share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 4:1 split, with me getting 800,000 and Bob getting 200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm offering you a more balanced split, but I need more of the money to make up for your higher inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation rates, the offer from Bob is more appealing now. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer and we can finalize the split."
