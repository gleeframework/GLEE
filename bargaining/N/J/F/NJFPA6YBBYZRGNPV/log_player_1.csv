I'm going to be greedy in the first round and see what Bob does!  I'll keep 90% and offer him 10%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm unhappy about the offer, I'm better off accepting it. The inflation means that even though I'm getting 10% of the money, it's only worth 90% of what I would have gotten in the first round. I can't risk another round and have the value of my share decrease further."
