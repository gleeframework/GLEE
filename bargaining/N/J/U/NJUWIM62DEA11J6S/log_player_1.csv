I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a pretty aggressive offer, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it rather than risk getting nothing in the next round.  Since I don't know how inflation affects him, I'll be conservative with my own offers to avoid losing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is playing a very risky game. While I'm getting less now, the potential for inflation means I could end up with nothing in the next round. I'm going to take my chances and hope I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm taking a more moderate approach this time.  I need to be careful, since inflation is working against me.  However, I still believe I can get a better deal than Bob's last offer.  I'm offering 750,000 for myself and 250,000 for Bob.  This seems like a fair compromise given the circumstances."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting a bit dicey.  The inflation is really hurting my potential earnings.  I'm only getting 300,000, but at this point, I'm worried about losing everything if I reject again.  I need to take this offer."
