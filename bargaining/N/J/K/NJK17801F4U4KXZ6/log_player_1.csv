"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where each of us gets $500,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I hope Bob will accept!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a good compromise. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, I'm not getting as much as I would have liked.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round. Maybe I can negotiate a better deal or propose a new offer that's more appealing to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

{""alice_gain"": 300000, ""bob_gain"": 700000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I still want a decent chunk for myself.""}

I'm proposing a 30/70 split, where I get $300,000 and Bob gets $700,000. I'm trying to find a balance between being generous and protecting my own interests. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small share, but I think this is a good compromise considering the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of money is decreasing rapidly! I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm rejecting this offer because I'm not getting a fair share. $100,000 is a tiny fraction of the original $1,000,000, and it's not enough to make up for the decreasing value of money. I'll keep trying to negotiate a better deal or propose a new offer that's more appealing to Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 250000, ""bob_gain"": 750000, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise further, but I still want a decent share considering the inflation.""}

I'm proposing a 25/75 split, where I get $250,000 and Bob gets $750,000. I'm trying to find a balance between being flexible and protecting my own interests in the face of inflation. Let's see if Bob will accept this offer!"
