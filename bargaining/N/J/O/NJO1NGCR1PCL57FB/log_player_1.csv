Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a smaller share this round, but I'm hoping we can do better next time. Let's see if you'll take a smaller share now. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I appreciate your compromise, but I think we can find a more equitable split.  I'm willing to go down to 6000, so you can have 4000.""}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to give up much more. I think 7000 is a fair share, considering the value of the money is decreasing with each round. 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, it's getting increasingly risky to keep rejecting. The inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money, and Bob's offer, while not ideal, is still a decent return considering the circumstances."
