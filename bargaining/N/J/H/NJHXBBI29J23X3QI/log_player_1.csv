Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going for a very high share in the first round. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but if not, I'll have more leverage in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair deal, and I don't want to risk losing more money due to inflation."
