9000.0,1000.0,Let's start fair. I propose we split it 90/10 in my favor.  We can negotiate further if you think that's too much.,Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
3000.0,7000.0,"Your offer was heavily skewed in your favor, Alice. How about we try a 70/30 split instead? It's still in your favor, considering the inflation.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
6000.0,4000.0,"Okay, I'm willing to compromise a bit more.  How about a 60/40 split? It's still a good deal for me considering inflation, and it shows I'm willing to negotiate.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"Alice, the inflation is working against you more each round. I'm offering a 60/40 split, but in my favor this time. It's a fair deal considering we're already four rounds in.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5000.0,5000.0,"Let's be reasonable, Bob. With inflation, we need to move towards a more even split. I propose we split it 50/50. It's the fairest option right now.",Alice,5,
