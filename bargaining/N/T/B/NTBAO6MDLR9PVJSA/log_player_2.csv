"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to split the money 90/10 in my favor. It's a fair offer, considering the inflation rate will affect you more than me.  Let's end this quickly! 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI won't accept such an unfair offer. The difference in inflation rates doesn't justify such a skewed split. I'll take my chances in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation rates, I think a 60/40 split is fair. If we don't agree soon, the money will be worth less for both of us. Let's compromise!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm sticking with a higher split, but I'm willing to compromise a bit.  Let's go with 70/30. We're both losing value with each passing round, so let's agree now. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}
I still think the offer is too skewed in Alice's favor. Given the increasing impact of inflation on my share, I'm willing to take the risk and make another proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""We're both losing value with each round. Considering the current inflation impact, I believe a 55/45 split is a reasonable compromise. Let's settle before it's too late!""}"
