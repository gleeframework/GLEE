"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer, Bob! Accept and we can move on to the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000, which is a relatively small amount, but I'm hoping he'll accept and we can proceed to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50, it's a fair deal! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is worth 95% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $475,000.

I'm not sure if splitting it 50/50 is the best deal for me, considering I could potentially get more in future rounds. I'll reject the offer and see what Bob comes up with next.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 90.25% of what it was in the first round (95% of 95%). So, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 810000,
  ""bob_gain"": 190000,
  ""message"": ""A slightly more aggressive offer this time, Bob. Hope you like it!""
}
```

I'm trying to get a bigger share of the pie, but I'm still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $250,000 is worth 24.75% of what it was in the first round (100% - 14.26% = 85.74%, and 85.74% of $250,000 is $214,350). However, I'm considering the offer in terms of its current value.

I'm not thrilled about getting only $250,000, but it's a decent compromise, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round with the money decreasing in value. I'll accept the offer.
