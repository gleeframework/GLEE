I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll take it and we can both get a good deal.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still pretty generous to him, but it's not a good deal for me, especially considering the inflation. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly better deal than his last offer, but still keeping most of the money for myself.  I'm hoping he'll accept this time, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the inflation has hurt me significantly, I'm going to accept Bob's offer. My share is much lower than I initially hoped, but it's still a decent amount, and with each passing round, the deal will only get worse for me. It's time to cut my losses and secure what I can."
