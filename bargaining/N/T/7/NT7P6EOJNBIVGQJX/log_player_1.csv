I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it quickly. It's a good start for me and a good opportunity for him to get something without risking it all."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer more, this is a fair offer. With inflation, my money is worth less each round, and I don't want to risk getting nothing. Accepting now is the best option for me."
