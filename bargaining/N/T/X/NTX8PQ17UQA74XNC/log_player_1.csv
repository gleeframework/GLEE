"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet in the middle, let's try again 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 50 is actually worth 90% of what I would have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to 54.

I'm not sure if I'm willing to meet in the middle this time, considering the inflation effect. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be slightly more aggressive this time. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more for the inflation.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting closer, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 45 is actually worth 72.9% of what I would have gotten in the first round, so it's equivalent to 72.9 * 60 = 43.74.

Considering the inflation effect, I think Bob's offer is a bit too aggressive, especially since my gain is worth less than what I initially proposed. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth even less now. Here's my next proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 40,
  ""bob_gain"": 60,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need to make sure I get something reasonable.""
}
```

Your turn, Bob!"
