"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I think this is a good starting point for negotiation. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's in my best interest to try and get a better deal.  Even though I'm losing value each round, I can counter-propose and potentially get more."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's flip the script this round. I think a 60/40 split is fairer, considering the value of the money is decreasing for me with each passing round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand the inflation is affecting you more, but I'm not willing to go below 5500. Let's meet halfway this time. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is the most rational choice. My money is losing value rapidly, and it's likely Alice won't budge further.  It's better to secure a decent gain now than risk getting nothing in later rounds."
