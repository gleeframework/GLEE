Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early.""
}
```

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $4,000 is now worth 90% of its original value, so it's equivalent to $3,600.

I'm not thrilled with the 2:3 split, but it's still a decent offer. I'll decide to...

  ""decision"": ""accept""
