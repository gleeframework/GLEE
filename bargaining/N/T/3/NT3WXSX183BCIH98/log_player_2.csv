Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, my offer is still on the table. It's getting risky with the inflation. Let's settle this fairly now. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on with inflation, Alice is clearly trying to secure a larger share. My offer in Round 2 was more reasonable given the circumstances. It's worth seeing if she'll budge closer to a 50/50 split as the rounds progress and the inflation intensifies for her."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, the clock is ticking, and inflation is eating our potential gains. Let's meet in the middle â€“ my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm moving slightly closer to a 50/50 split to signal some flexibility, but I'm holding firm that I should receive a larger portion due to the inflation disparity. This offer is my attempt to settle before the shrinking pot makes it pointless to argue over smaller differences."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm taking a hit from the inflation with each round. Meet me halfway, or this will be my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the heat from the inflation, but she's still trying to hold onto a significantly larger share. My offer in Round 4 was more than fair. By rejecting this offer, I'm communicating that I'm willing to risk it all to get a deal closer to my last offer.  The rapidly increasing inflation rate will hopefully push her towards a more agreeable split in the next round."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. I'm offering a slight compromise, but this is my absolute bottom line. Let's be smart and take this deal before inflation eats away even more of our potential gains.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm nudging slightly closer to a 50/50 split, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. However, I'm making it clear this is my final offer. The message emphasizes the urgency and potential loss for both of us if we continue to haggle.  The pressure is now on Alice to either accept a reasonable deal or risk getting nothing as the remaining rounds dwindle."
