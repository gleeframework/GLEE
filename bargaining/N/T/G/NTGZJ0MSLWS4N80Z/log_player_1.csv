"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start to our negotiations""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me the majority of the initial $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in getting a guaranteed 40% of the money rather than risking a worse deal in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to find a better balance, I'm willing to give you a bit more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $300,000 gain is now worth 80% of its original value, making it $240,000. Bob's $700,000 gain is worth 140% of its original value, making it $980,000.

I'm not impressed with this offer. I think I can do better. I'll reject it.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 80% of its original value after two rounds of inflation, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think this is a fairer split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, giving Bob a slightly larger share of the money. I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him than my previous offer, and that he'll accept this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give up some more, but I think I'm getting a bit too low 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my $420,000 gain from round 3 is now worth 51.2% of its original value, making it $208,800.

I'm not sure if I should accept this offer. The $450,000 I'd gain is worth 45% of its original value, making it $450,000, which is a significant amount. I'm tempted to take it, but I'm not sure if I'm getting the best deal possible.

After considering the options, I'll accept Bob's offer.
