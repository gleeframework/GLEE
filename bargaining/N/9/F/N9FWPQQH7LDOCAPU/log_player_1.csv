"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000
}
```

This means I'm offering to take 80% of the $10,000, leaving Bob with $2,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth 5% less, so the offer is:

Alice gain: 7,000 x 0.95 = 6,650
Bob gain: 3,000 x 0.95 = 2,850

I accept this offer. 

```

  ""decision"": ""accept""
