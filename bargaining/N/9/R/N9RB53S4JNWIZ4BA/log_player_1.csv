"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I propose a 9000/1000 split, with me receiving the larger portion. This ensures that the game can potentially proceed further, allowing for more negotiation and a potentially better outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I propose a 7000/3000 split, with me receiving the larger portion. While I'm willing to compromise, I believe a 70/30 split is more fair given the inflation factor and the fact that we have a limited number of rounds to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

I propose a 50/50 split, with me receiving half of the remaining money. Given the substantial inflation and the limited rounds left, a 50/50 split seems like the most reasonable and fair option for both of us.  This ensures that we both get something, and it avoids the risk of getting nothing at all if we continue to disagree."
