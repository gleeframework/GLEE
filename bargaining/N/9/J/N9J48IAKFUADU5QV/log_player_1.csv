"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a fair starting point, considering I'm taking the risk of being the first to propose."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 80 
# Bob gain: 20 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 85, ""bob_gain"": 15}
```

I'm willing to compromise a bit from my initial offer, but I still need to get a good portion of the money.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that the inflation is working against him, and that he'll accept this deal before things get worse for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While the inflation is hurting me, it's still more advantageous for me to continue negotiating. I believe I can get a better deal than this, and I'm willing to take the risk."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 80, ""bob_gain"": 20}
```

I'm going to stick to my guns and offer a deal closer to my previous proposal.  While Bob is getting a better deal than round 3, inflation is still working against him.  I hope this will be enough to convince him to accept before things get worse."
