# Alice gain: 5800

I'm going to reject this offer. While it's an improvement, it's still not a fair split. I believe we can negotiate a more equitable solution."

# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700

While the inflation is really hurting me now, I'm going to accept this offer.  It's not ideal, but it's better than getting nothing at all."
