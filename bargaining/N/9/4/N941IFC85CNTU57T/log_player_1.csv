Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I propose dividing the $1,000,000 with a 60/40 split in favor of Alice. This offers a fair balance considering the diminishing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bigger share, but I think 60/40 is too skewed. I'm offering a more balanced 70/30 split. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
