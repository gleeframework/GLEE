"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems fair and reasonable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think we can both do better than a 60/40 split. Let's try a 60/40 split in my favor this time. We can work out a more equitable deal in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I don't think I'll accept Bob's offer. His proposal is essentially the same as my previous offer, but with the advantage going to him. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In Round 3, the money is worth 10% less than in Round 2, so the total amount is now $9,000. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 55-45 split""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than the previous offers."
