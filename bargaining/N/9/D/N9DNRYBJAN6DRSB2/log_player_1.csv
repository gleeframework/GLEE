"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, giving me $600,000 and leaving Bob with $400,000. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting that this is a fair starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit less, but I'm still generous 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 5% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not convinced that this is a fair offer, especially considering the significant difference in the split. I'd like to propose another round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's try 42-58""
}
```

I'm proposing a 42-58 split, trying to find a compromise that's more balanced. My message to Bob is a friendly one, suggesting we meet in the middle and try to find a mutually acceptable split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not getting taken advantage of 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The effects of inflation are starting to bite!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer, as it's a slightly more favorable split for me than before, and I don't want to risk going into another round with the money continuing to lose value."
