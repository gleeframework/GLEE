"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, I'll take the lion's share this round, but we can work out a better deal later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only 10% of the total amount. I'll take my chances and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle and split fairly, we both get a good share.""}\n\nSince the money loses 10% of its value for me with each passing round, I want to reach an agreement quickly. I'll start by offering a 55-45 split in my favor, hoping Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise."
