Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:

# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is feeling the pressure of the inflation and is reducing her demand. However, she's still heavily favoring herself in the split. Since the inflation only affects her, I can afford to be patient and continue to push for a more favorable deal. My offers are becoming increasingly appealing to her as time goes on."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's end this. A 50/50 split is the fairest option.  You're losing money with every round, and this ensures we both benefit.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to push for a 50/50 split. Here's why:

* **Psychological Pressure:**  Alice is clearly feeling the heat of the inflation. Offering an even split might be tempting enough for her to accept and avoid further losses. 
* **Fairness Argument:**  While I'm not affected by the inflation, a 50/50 split is objectively fair from the initial conditions of the game.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for more might backfire. Alice might become increasingly frustrated and offer even less favorable deals in the future."
