Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've compromised, but I still think I deserve the bigger share 
# Bob gain: 43 
# Alice gain: 57 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Here's why I decided to accept:

* **Inflation:** The value of the money is decreasing significantly with each round. Waiting longer means getting even less in the end.
* **Improving Offer:** Alice's offer has improved slightly from her initial 60/40 split. While not ideal, it's better to secure something now than risk getting a worse offer later. 
* **Uncertainty:** There's no guarantee Alice will offer anything better in future rounds. She might become more demanding, especially knowing I rejected her previous offers. 

It's a compromise, but given the circumstances, accepting is the most logical choice."
