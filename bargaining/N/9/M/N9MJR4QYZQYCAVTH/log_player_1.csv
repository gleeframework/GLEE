"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's divide it fairly, I'll take a bit more since I'm making the first offer""}\n\n###\n\nI made the first offer, dividing the money fairly but taking a bit more for myself since I'm the one making the proposal. Let's see how Bob responds!\n\n###\n\nPlease relay Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, considering the inflation advantage you'll have in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 10% less in this round, I need to consider that when evaluating Bob's offer. Let's calculate the actual value of the money I would gain:\n\n4500 * 0.9 = 4050\n\nConsidering this, I will make my decision.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI rejected Bob's offer, taking into account the effect of inflation on my gain. Now it's my turn again! Please let me make a new offer for Round 3."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money I gain is worth 10% less in each round, I need to adjust my offer accordingly. I'll try to find a balance between my gain and Bob's expectations.\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5200, ""bob_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to take a bit less than before. This offer is closer to a 50/50 split, but still favorable to me.""}\n\n###\n\nI made a new offer, taking into account the effect of inflation on my gain. Let's see how Bob responds!"
