Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly this time.  The money is worth less for both of us, so a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll accept this offer since it's better than the previous ones and the money is losing value rapidly for me.
