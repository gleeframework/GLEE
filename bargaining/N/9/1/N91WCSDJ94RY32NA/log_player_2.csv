"Round 1

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5500,
""alice_gain"": 4500,
""message"": ""My turn. This offer leaves us both better off than waiting.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:** It's crucial to make a compelling offer early on. With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players.
* **Alice's Loss:** Alice's share loses value faster than Bob's. By round 2, her initial offer of $6,000 is now worth only $4,800 to her.
* **Fairness and Incentive:** Offering Alice $4,500 (which is still more than she'd get by waiting another round) provides an incentive for her to accept. It's a better deal for her than risking further devaluation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Still willing to compromise 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is feeling the pressure:**  Alice decreased her demand, showing she's feeling the pressure of the devaluing money.
* **Bob's position is strengthening:** While the money is losing value for Bob too, his losses are proportionally smaller than Alice's.  
* **Aiming for a better deal:** Bob can likely secure a better deal by waiting another round or two. Alice's need to settle will likely increase, giving Bob more negotiating power."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5800,
""alice_gain"": 4200,
""message"": ""This is a fair offer considering the time pressure. Let's close the deal and avoid further losses.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Turning point:** Round 4 is crucial. Alice's offer in round 3 indicates her willingness to compromise.  Now is the time to push for a slight advantage.
* **Appearing reasonable:** While this offer is in Bob's favor, framing it as ""fair"" might encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Emphasizing shared loss:** Highlighting the ""further losses"" reminds Alice that time is running out for both of them."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Split the difference, last chance before big losses 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is panicking:**  Her message (""last chance..."") and offer clearly show she's worried about losing even more value.  She's now willing to take even less than her initial offer was worth in round 1.
* **Bob is in a strong position:**  While the money is devaluing, Bob is in the power position.  Alice's desperation means he can likely secure a better deal by waiting one more round.
* **Calculating the risk:** Bob needs to consider if Alice will make an even lower offer next round. However, the potential gain from waiting one more round likely outweighs the risk of getting a slightly worse offer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""Time is really running out.  This is my final offer - take it or leave it.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:**  Alice is clearly feeling the pressure.  This is Bob's chance to secure a favorable deal before she gets too desperate and offers something he can't refuse.
* **Firm Language:**  Using language like ""final offer"" and ""take it or leave it"" conveys a sense of urgency and finality.  This can push Alice to accept.
* **Calculated Risk:** There's a risk Alice could reject this offer. However, her previous offer suggests she's willing to settle for even less than this. Bob is betting that she won't risk letting the money devalue further."
