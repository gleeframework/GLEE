"Round 1

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is biting!

I'll think for a moment... Since Bob's offer is closer to the 50-50 split I initially proposed, I'll consider it. But I'm still not satisfied with the 9% difference in favor of Bob. I'll reject this offer.

However, I'm starting to realize that I might not get a better deal than this. The value of my potential gains is decreasing rapidly due to inflation, and Bob is getting a larger and larger share of the remaining value. I'll have to make a tough decision...

Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","The inflation is almost suffocating my potential winnings now! My offer will be extremely skewed towards me in round 11. Here it is:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

I'm taking a very aggressive approach by offering a significantly higher percentage to myself, and I'm not leaving much room for Bob to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm not sure if he'll be willing to settle for such a small share.

This is likely my last chance to get a decent deal, and I'm willing to take a risk to get a better outcome."

Considering the extremely low value of my potential gains, I'll think carefully... But to be honest, I'm starting to realize that I've been foolish to reject previous offers. Bob's offer is still not ideal, but it's the best I'm likely to get at this point.

I'll accept this offer, hoping that it's better than the alternative, which is walking away with almost nothing.
