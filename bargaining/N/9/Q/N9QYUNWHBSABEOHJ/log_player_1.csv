"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, which seems reasonable. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, I'll have to adjust my valuation of the offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, but the money Bob gains is worth 10% less, I'll have to consider that in my decision.

My gain of 4000 is still a significant amount, but Bob's gain of 6000 is worth 10% less than it would have been in the first round. So, in terms of ""purchasing power"", Bob's gain is still larger than mine.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit too generous for me, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to myself. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fairer split.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to 5500, which is a bit more than my initial offer, while keeping Bob's gain at 4500. Let's see if this one sticks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I still think I deserve a slightly larger share. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! Considering that Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll have to adjust my valuation of the offer accordingly.

In terms of purchasing power, Bob's gain of 4800 is now worth even less than my gain of 5200. I think I can do better than this offer. I'll reject it and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time, considering the increasing value of money. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5800,
  ""bob_gain"": 4200,
  ""message"": ""I think I deserve a bigger share, considering the value of money is decreasing.""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain to 5800, which is a bit more than the previous offers, and keeping Bob's gain at 4200. Let's see if this one is more appealing to him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll meet you halfway, but I think this is the best I can do. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of Bob's gain is decreasing rapidly due to inflation! Considering that Bob's gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I think this offer is actually a relatively good deal for me.

In terms of purchasing power, Bob's gain of 5000 is now worth significantly less than my gain of 5000. I think I can live with this offer, especially since it's a 50/50 split.
