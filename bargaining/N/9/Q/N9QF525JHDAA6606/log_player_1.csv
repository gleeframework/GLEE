"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, fair and square!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $500,000 each. Let's see if Bob accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You can have a smaller share, but I'm still generous! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Thanks for the update on the inflation!

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to think carefully. If I accept, I'll get $300,000, which is less than what I initially proposed. However, it's still a significant amount, and I don't want to risk going to the next round with even less value.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
