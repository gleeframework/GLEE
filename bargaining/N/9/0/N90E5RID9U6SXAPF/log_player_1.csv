"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get $80 and Bob gets $20. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, Alice. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to adjust my expectations. However, Bob's offer seems reasonable, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer, and we can move on to the next round."
