"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","I'll start with a fair offer. Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000}

I'll take 50% and leave 50% for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 10% less, so I'll get $450,000 (300,000 / 0.9) and Bob will get $770,000 (700,000 / 0.8).

I'll accept Bob's offer.
