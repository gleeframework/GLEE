"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 and start fresh.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still not willing to go 50/50. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me and 5% less for Bob, I'll have to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the effects of inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the decreasing value of money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not willing to give you more than 45%.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, which is a bit more generous than my previous offer. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to meet you in the middle, but I'm not willing to give up more than 52%. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","With the effects of inflation taking a bigger hit, I'll have to be even more careful with my decision. Considering the decreasing value of money, I'll evaluate Bob's new offer.

Since the money is worth significantly less now, I'm willing to accept this offer to get some money out of the deal.
