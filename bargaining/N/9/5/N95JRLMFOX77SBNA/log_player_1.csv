Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly while it's still worth something. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is now worth 20% less, I'll have to consider the reduced value. Bob's offer of an even split would give me $5000, but that's equivalent to $4000 in the original value. Considering my initial offer was $6000, I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round.\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nLet's proceed to the next round!"
