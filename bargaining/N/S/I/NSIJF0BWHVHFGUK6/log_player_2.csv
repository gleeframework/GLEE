Alice's offer is getting better, but it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The inflation is working in my favor and she's clearly feeling the pressure to make a deal. I need to hold out for a much better offer."

Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is a tough one, and very risky, but Alice is clearly bluffing.  She's not going to let 850,000 (even with the inflation) disappear to spite me.  She's trying to scare me into accepting.  I need to call her bluff, but I'll likely need to concede significantly in the next round if she doesn't back down."

Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 300000,
""alice_gain"": 700000,
""message"": ""Okay, Alice, you were right to push back on my last offer.  Let's make a deal - I'm taking a significant hit here, but I think it's more important we both walk away with something. This is my final offer.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's time to make Alice a deal she can't refuse, even with the inflation working against her.  Here's why:

* **Calling the Bluff:** I called her bluff in the last round, showing her I'm willing to risk it all. Now it's time to show I'm also reasonable.
* **Significant Concession:**  A 70/30 split heavily favors Alice, but it's a significant move from my previous offer and acknowledges the time pressure. 
* **Final Offer:**  This language creates a sense of urgency and finality.  Alice knows this is her best shot, especially considering the shrinking pot. 

This is a risky strategy, but with only a few rounds left, a bold move is needed to avoid a stalemate and get some money."
