"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 999,999 dollars and leave 1 dollar for Bob. It's a very generous offer considering the inflation risk.  Let's see if he accepts it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I would have preferred to keep more, it's clear that Bob is willing to negotiate fairly.  With the inflation risk, accepting this offer is the best course of action."
