I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. This is a pretty aggressive offer, but I figure Bob might be willing to accept it since it's the first round and he doesn't know about the inflation. I'm also hoping to secure a good portion of the money before inflation starts eating away at it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Bob's offer is a 50/50 split.  While I would prefer a larger share, the inflation is already starting to take a toll on the value of the money.  It's better to secure at least half now than risk getting nothing at all in later rounds."
