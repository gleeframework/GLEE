"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you $100,000 and keep the rest.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 90/10 split, which seems fair to me. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle! I'll give you 500,000 and keep 500,000 for myself. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less, so I need to be careful.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable compromise, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 450,000, and I'll take 550,000. It's a slightly better deal for me.""
}
```

Your turn again, Bob!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is worth 5% less than in the previous round.

Considering Bob's previous offer, I think I can try to get an even better deal. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 580,000, but I need a bit more. This is my final offer.""
}
```

Let's see if Bob will accept this one!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal. I'll take 600,000 and leave 400,000 for you. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gain!

Considering Bob's offer, I think I should try to get as much as possible. However, this offer is a bit better than my previous one, and it's getting late in the game. I'll accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I'll take the 400,000. It's not the best deal, but it's better than nothing.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will stick to his word and we can finalize the deal!"
