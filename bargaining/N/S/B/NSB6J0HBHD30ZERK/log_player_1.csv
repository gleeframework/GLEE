"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and keep $6000 for myself. The message I attached is ""Let's split fairly"".\n\nNow it's Bob's turn. He can either accept this offer and we'll end the game, or he can reject it and make a counteroffer in the next round.\n\nPlease let me know what Bob decides to do."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn. This is more equitable considering the inflation disparity. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nSince I'm playing as Alice, I will decide whether to accept or reject Bob's offer.\n\nBob's offer is $4500 for me and $5500 for himself, with the message ""My turn. This is more equitable considering the inflation disparity."" I have to consider the impact of inflation on the money's value. Since the money I gain is worth 5% less than in the first round, I need to take that into account.\n\nAfter considering the offer, I decide to reject it. The decision is:\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nNow it's my turn again. I will make a new proposal to divide the money, taking into account the reduced value due to inflation.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better split""}\n\nPlease let me know what Bob decides to do next."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nAs Alice, I already sent my new proposal at the end of the previous round, but I'll reiterate it here for clarity:\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a better split""}\n\nThis proposal takes into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation and is a bit more favorable to me, while still offering Bob a significant share.\n\nPlease let me know how Bob responds to this offer.\n\n###\n\nIf you need anything else, feel free to ask!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  Let's settle before inflation eats away at the value further. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","As Alice, I will decide whether to accept or reject Bob's offer.\n\nBob's offer is $4900 for me and $5100 for himself, with the message ""This is my final offer. Let's settle before inflation eats away at the value further."" Given the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, with my gain being worth 14.26% less and Bob's gain being worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I need to carefully consider the offer.\n\nAfter weighing the options, I decide to accept Bob's offer. The decision is:\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince I've accepted the offer, the game will end here. The final division of the $10,000 is $4900 for me (Alice) and $5100 for Bob."
