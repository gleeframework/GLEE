I propose to take 990,000 dollars and give Bob 10,000.  It's a fair start considering the potential inflation. Let's see what Bob thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
This offer is significantly worse for me, especially with the inflation. I'll take a chance and reject. Let's see what happens in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 100,000 dollars and keep 900,000 for myself.  I think this is a reasonable compromise after his last offer, and I hope he sees it that way!"
