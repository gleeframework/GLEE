"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

I'm offering you $200,000, and I'll take the remaining $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","In this round, the money is worth 10% less for me, so I'll have to adjust my calculation accordingly.

I'll calculate my gain in the original amount, which is $450,000, and then adjust for the inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll get $450,000 / 0.9 = $500,000.

I'll accept this offer.
