"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40% of the initial $100, which is $40."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less in Round 2, I get 50% of $80 (which is 80% of the original $100), which is $40. 

I accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
