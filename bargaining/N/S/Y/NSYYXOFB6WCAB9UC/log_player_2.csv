"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's compromise. I'm willing to reduce my share to 60% to reach a more balanced split. This offer is still fair considering the inflation risk, and I hope you'll accept it. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to a reasonable split, it's essential to consider the impact of inflation. Even though her share has decreased, the value of her 600,000 dollars is diminishing at a slower rate than in the previous rounds. Meanwhile, my potential gain remains static. It's still worthwhile to negotiate for a better deal."
