"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
``` 
I propose that I receive $9000 and Bob receives $1000. This gives me the majority of the money while still giving Bob something, hopefully making him more likely to accept the deal in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While this offer is better than nothing, I believe I can still get a better deal. It's only the second round, and Bob is already losing a significant amount of value with each round. I will reject this offer and see if he's willing to give me a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly from the first round, but I'm still giving Bob a decent amount. I believe this offer is fair, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid further inflation losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm getting significantly less than I initially wanted, the inflation is really starting to bite into Bob's gains. He's already lost almost half of his potential value. It's risky to keep rejecting offers at this point.  I'll take the $4500 and hope I can make better decisions in future games."
