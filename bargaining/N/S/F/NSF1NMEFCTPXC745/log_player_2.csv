"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Alice's offer was 90% of the initial amount, I'll try to counter with a similar proposal. Here's my offer for Round 2:

{""bob_gain"": 92, ""alice_gain"": 8}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 15 
# Alice gain: 85 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation taking a toll on my gains, I'll have to be more cautious. Since Alice's offer is still relatively close to the initial offer, I'll try to negotiate further. However, I'll accept this offer for now to avoid further losses due to inflation.
