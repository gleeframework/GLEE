"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical. I'm taking a slightly larger share, but I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.  Accept this and we can avoid any further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'd rather not accept a deal that gives me less than I would have gotten in the first round. However, Bob's offer is still a good one, and it's getting closer to the end of the game.

I'll decide to...

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 40% less for me now (20% less than the previous round), I'll have to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you the majority of the money, Bob. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```"
