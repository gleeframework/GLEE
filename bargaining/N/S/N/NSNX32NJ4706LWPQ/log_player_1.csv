"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, hoping to set a fair tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, a good starting point 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before making a decision.

Since Bob's offer is 40 for me, that's 40% of the remaining $100, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. However, considering the inflation rates, the actual value of the money I gain is 10% less than in the first round.

I'll decide to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was 40, I'll try to counter with a slightly lower amount, taking into account the inflation rate. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 35 for me, 65 for you""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm not giving up much 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems Bob is trying to squeeze out a better deal for himself. Considering the inflation rates, the actual value of the money I gain is 27.1% less than in the first round.

I'll think carefully before making a decision. Since Bob's offer is 30, I'm not getting a great deal, but I don't want to risk going into the next round with even less value. I'll decide to accept this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
