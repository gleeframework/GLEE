"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'm willing to give you a generous 10% to get the negotiations rolling.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small amount to see how he reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not a charity, I want a bigger share. Will you meet me in the middle? 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to negotiate a better deal.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not quite, I'm not willing to give up 2/3 of the money. I'll meet you halfway, but I'll need to take more than 1/3.""
}
```

I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm giving him a hint that I'm open to a compromise."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more. This is a fair split, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to give Bob a slightly smaller share, but still a significant one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting a bit too greedy, Alice. I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to make a more substantial offer.

Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, I think this is a fair deal. I'm willing to accept 300,000. Let's shake on it!""
}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer, as it seems like a reasonable compromise."
