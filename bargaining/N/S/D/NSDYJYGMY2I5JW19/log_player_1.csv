"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 999999, ""bob_gain"": 1}
``` 

I propose to take almost all the money, leaving Bob with just $1.  This is a very aggressive strategy, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it to avoid the risk of getting nothing if he rejects and I get to propose again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer more, it's better to take the 200,000 now than risk getting nothing in the next round. Inflation means I'm losing nothing by accepting this, and Bob might become even more greedy in the next round."
