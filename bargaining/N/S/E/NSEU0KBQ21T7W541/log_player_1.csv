"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a fairly standard opening offer, with me taking the majority of the money. Now it's Bob's turn to respond!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to be more aggressive in the second round.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 50-50, I'll try to take a bit more this time, considering the inflation effect. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45
}
```

This way, I'm taking a bit more, but still leaving Bob with a decent share. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob is trying to take more, but I'm not sure if I should give in yet.

I'll think about it for a moment... 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was 55-45, I'll try to take an even bigger share this time, considering the inflation effect. Here's my revised offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

This way, I'm taking a larger share, but still leaving Bob with a decent amount. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take the majority of the money. I'll think about it for a moment...

Since my gain is still worth the same as in the first round, and Bob's gain is worth significantly less due to inflation, I think I should take this offer. It's a good opportunity to get a decent share of the money before it loses even more value.
