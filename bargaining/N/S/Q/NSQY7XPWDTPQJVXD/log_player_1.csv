Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 60/40 is a fairer split, with me getting slightly more since I'm the one making the offer this round. Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm offering you 45% - that's more than I wanted to give initially.  Every round we delay, the money shrinks. Let's settle this now.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're losing money with each round. Let's split it 55/45.  It's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away with something. What do you say? 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
``` 

Bob is finally budging, and while it's not ideal, accepting a 45/55 split now is better than risking even less money in future rounds."
