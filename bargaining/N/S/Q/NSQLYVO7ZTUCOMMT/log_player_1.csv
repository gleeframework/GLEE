Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a high initial offer, hoping Bob will accept. I'll keep in mind the inflation factor and adjust my strategy as the rounds progress."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I reject the offer. I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially with the decreasing value of the money. I'll make a counter offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer to be more reasonable, but still aiming for a significant share. I'm keeping in mind the inflation, but I also need to make a proposal that Bob might find acceptable."
