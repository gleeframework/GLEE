Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the pressure of the inflation, but a 50/50 split isn't fair to me considering the initial rounds. This offer is a compromise â€“ let's secure a win-win before it's too late. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While the pressure is on, accepting Alice's offer at this stage would be a significant loss for me compared to the initial rounds. The inflation is working heavily against me, but Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate. I'll push for a slightly better deal in the next round, aiming for a 45/55 split in my favor."

{
""bob_gain"": 450000,
""alice_gain"": 550000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  You've consistently rejected a 50/50 split, so this is a compromise that acknowledges the inflation working against me while still giving you a larger share. Let's be realistic and close this deal.""
