"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm assuming that Bob will be more likely to accept a small amount than to risk getting nothing at all if he rejects and we move to the next round. However, with inflation, the value of the money will decrease, so I'm not going to be too greedy in this first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. Even with the inflation, I am still getting 900,000 in the first round, while I'm only getting 100,000 in this round. It is not in my best interest to accept this offer. I believe I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 810000, ""bob_gain"": 190000}
```

I'm going to propose an 81/19 split in my favor. The inflation has impacted both of us, but my goal is to still maintain a significant share of the money. Since Bob rejected my previous offer, I need to offer him a larger portion to increase the likelihood of him accepting. This offer still gives me a comfortable lead, considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting a much smaller share than I would have preferred in the first few rounds, the inflation has drastically decreased the value of the money. At this point, getting 200,000 is better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round. It's not a good deal, but it's better than nothing."
