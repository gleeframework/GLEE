Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Given the increasing impact of inflation on your end, this seems like a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice gain: 4200 
# Bob gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Although I'm getting significantly less due to inflation, accepting this offer ensures I get something rather than risk getting nothing if Bob rejects my next proposal and the inflation continues to eat away at my share."
