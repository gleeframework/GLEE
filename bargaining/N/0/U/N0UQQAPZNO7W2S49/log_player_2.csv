I'm not sure if I'm satisfied with a 40% share. I'm going to see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I think a 60-40 split is fairer, reflecting my willingness to take the lead in this negotiation. Let's see if you agree.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. But I think I deserve a bit more for taking the risk of proposing first. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, I'm not sure I can get a better deal in the next round due to inflation. I'll take the 4500 and move on."
