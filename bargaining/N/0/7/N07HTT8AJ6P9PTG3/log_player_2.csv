Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous, Bob. Take 100,000, and let's get this over with.

# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm going to see if I can get a better deal. 100,000 is not a lot of money to split a million dollars."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 900000, ""alice_gain"": 100000, ""message"": ""I think we can both do better than that. Let's split it 90/10, with me taking the larger share this time.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to negotiate, Bob. Let's split it 55/45.  I believe this is a fair deal, considering the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm still holding out for a better deal. I think I can get more than 450,000."
