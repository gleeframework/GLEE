,,,Bob,1,reject
45.0,55.0,I think 60/40 is a bit too much in your favor. How about we do a 55/45 split? The money is still worth a lot in this round.,Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
50.0,50.0,"Let's try a 50/50 split this time. We both get a fair share, and we can move on to something more interesting.  What do you say?",Alice,3,

42.0,58.0,"I appreciate the 50/50 offer, but considering the inflation is affecting your gain more, I'll try a 58/42 split this time. Still a relatively fair deal, I think.",Bob,4,

55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try 55/45. This is a compromise, and we can avoid further inflation losses.",Alice,5,
