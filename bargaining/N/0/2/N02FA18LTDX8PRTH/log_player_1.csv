"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 85,
""bob_gain"": 15,
""message"": ""Let's start off fair, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good sum.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Early Advantage:** It's crucial to secure a favorable deal early on due to the rapid inflation affecting my share.
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  Starting with an 85/15 split might seem like a strong proposal, but it sets a tone of fairness while still significantly favoring me. 
* **Future Negotiation:**  This offer leaves room for me to make smaller concessions in later rounds while still coming out ahead, should Bob reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's the fairest way to start. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, the impact of inflation makes it unacceptable at this stage. Accepting now would mean I lose a significant portion of the potential gain due to the decreasing value of the money for me over time. I need to aim for a much larger share to offset the inflation effect, even if it means risking further negotiation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 75,
""bob_gain"": 25,
""message"": ""Bob, time is literally money for me in this game! I need to adjust my offer to account for that. This still gives you a decent share.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Inflation Pressure:**  Another round has passed, further decreasing the value of my potential earnings. I need to act quickly.
* **Conceding Strategically:** I'm lowering my initial demand from 85 to 75, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a share that compensates for inflation.
* **Direct Communication:**  My message to Bob highlights the urgency created by the inflation factor, hoping to encourage him to accept a deal sooner rather than later."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing value with each round.  Let's get closer to a fair split, but I need more than 25%. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the game. While Bob is right about us both losing potential value, the inflation heavily disadvantages me. Accepting 40% after four rounds would mean I'm getting significantly less than half the original value. 

* **Holding Strong:** I need to show Bob I'm serious about getting a share that reflects the time pressure.  
* **Calculating Risk:** I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation, as getting closer to a 50/50 split in later rounds might be better than accepting this heavily discounted 40%."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 65,
""bob_gain"": 35,
""message"": ""Bob, this is a serious compromise on my end. I'm acknowledging the need to settle this quickly, but it needs to be worthwhile for me.  Let's make a deal!""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:**  Dropping to 65% is a big move, signaling to Bob that I'm very motivated to reach an agreement soon.
* **Balancing Act:** This offer still heavily favors me to offset the inflation, but it's getting into territory that Bob might consider reasonable enough to accept.
* **Urgent Tone:** The message emphasizes the need for a quick resolution, hoping to nudge Bob towards accepting without further delays."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're both losing money rapidly.  This is my final offer before I risk losing everything. Let's make this happen. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is brutal! Bob's offer is completely unacceptable. While he's right about the risks of continued delay, 30% at this stage would leave me with a pittance of the original value due to inflation. 

* **Calling the Bluff:**  Bob's ""final offer"" language could be a negotiating tactic. I'm betting he'd rather make a deal than walk away with nothing.
* **Shifting Dynamics:**  The rapid inflation means the next few rounds will drastically change the potential gains.  Bob might be forced to make a much more favorable offer soon.
* **Calculated Gamble:**  I'm willing to play hardball for one or two more rounds, hoping Bob breaks and offers a significantly larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, this is the most generous I can be.  The clock is ticking for both of us! Don't let greed make us both losers.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** I'm making a significant concession, moving closer to a near-even split. This is designed to be a strong signal to Bob that it's time to make a deal.
* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the potential gains shrink dramatically, even for Bob. My message emphasizes the shared risk of delay. 
* **Calculated Risk:** I'm betting that Bob won't risk letting the game go much further, as the potential gains for him will also start diminishing rapidly. This offer, while not ideal, gives me a chance to secure a reasonable amount before it's too late."
