"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, 60-40 split""}\n\nI'm offering a 60-40 split, which I believe is a reasonable and fair division of the $10,000. I hope Bob will accept this offer and we can conclude the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm sure we can find a better balance - let's try a 60/40 split in my favor. It's a fair starting point. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm not willing to accept a 60-40 split in Bob's favor, especially since the money I gain is now worth 20% less due to inflation. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","In this round, I'll take into account the inflation and try to find a mutually acceptable division. Since the money I gain is worth 20% less, I'll aim for a slightly higher amount to compensate for the loss in value.\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, let's meet in the middle with a 58-42 split""}\n\nI hope this offer is more appealing to Bob, and we can come to an agreement."
