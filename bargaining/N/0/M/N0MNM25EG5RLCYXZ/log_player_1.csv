"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, then we can negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40. I'm framing this as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept and we can move on to the next round."
