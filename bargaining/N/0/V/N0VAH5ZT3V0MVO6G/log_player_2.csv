I reject the offer. While it seems fair at first, it doesn't account for the inflation. I can likely get a better deal for myself by proposing later."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json

""bob_gain"": 6000,
""alice_gain"": 4000,
""message"": ""I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, accounting for the inflation on your side.  This ensures we both get something, and I can still afford to take the risk of inflation.""
}

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the increasing inflation, I'm making a compromise, slightly in your favor, but still fair. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
I'm still going to reject this offer. While it's slightly better than the first round, it doesn't fully account for the inflation on Alice's side. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the coming rounds."

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.

# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer.  Even though it's slightly better for me, it's still not accounting for the significant inflation Alice is facing.  I believe I can still secure a better deal for myself by continuing to negotiate."

Round 6

# Bob gain: 4600 
# Alice gain: 5400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject this offer. While Alice is acknowledging the inflation, she's still not offering enough to compensate for the significant losses she's experiencing. I'm confident that I can still get a better deal in the coming rounds."
