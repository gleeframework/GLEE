"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```

I'm offering a 50-50 split to start, which is a fair and simple proposal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less for Bob due to inflation, I'll have to be careful. In this case, I'll accept the offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take $40 now, and we can move on to the next round."
