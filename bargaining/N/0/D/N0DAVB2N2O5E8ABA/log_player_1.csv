"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll give you a good deal, but don't expect it to last!""
}
```

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point, but I'm prepared for Bob to counteroffer!"
