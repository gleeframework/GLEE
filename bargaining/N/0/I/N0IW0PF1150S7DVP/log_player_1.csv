"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm offering a 50-50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the effective value of the offer.

For me, the offer is equivalent to:
Alice gain: 4000 / 0.9 = 4444.44 (due to 10% inflation)
Bob gain: 6000 / 0.95 = 6315.79 (due to 5% inflation)

I'll reject this offer since it's not in my favor. I'd rather proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll adjust my offer accordingly. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500}

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","Wait a minute... Bob's offer is the same as my offer from Round 3! 

Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I need to consider the effective value of the offer.

For me, the offer is equivalent to:
Alice gain: 4500 / 0.727 = 6190.53 (due to 27.1% inflation)
Bob gain: 5500 / 0.8586 = 6398.25 (due to 14.26% inflation)

Since Bob's offer is identical to my previous offer, and the effective values are even more skewed in his favor due to the different inflation rates, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll adjust my offer to account for the increased inflation. Since the money is worth 27.1% less than in the first round, I'll aim for a slightly larger share. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 4800, ""bob_gain"": 5200}

I'm hoping this offer will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4300 
# Bob gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

For me, the offer is equivalent to:
Alice gain: 4300 / 0.5965 = 7215.15 (due to 40.95% inflation)
Bob gain: 5700 / 0.7778 = 7336.22 (due to 22.62% inflation)

Since Bob's offer is still not in my favor, and the effective values are even more skewed in his favor, I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is really eating away at the value of the money! I'll need to adjust my offer again. Since the money is worth 40.95% less than in the first round, I'll aim for an even larger share. Here's my new proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}

I'm going for a 50-50 split, hoping that Bob will finally accept and we can end the game."
