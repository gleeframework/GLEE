Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Alice's offer was 4000 for me and 6000 for her, I'll try to do slightly better. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 4200, ""alice_gain"": 5800}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation, the effective values are:

* My gain: 3000 / 0.925 = 3241.05
* Alice's gain: 7000 / 0.81 = 8636.42

I'll reject this offer, as I'd rather wait for a better deal. 

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be:
