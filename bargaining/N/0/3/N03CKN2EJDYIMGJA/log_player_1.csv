"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nSince it's the first round, I'll start with a fairly moderate offer, giving myself a slight advantage while still being somewhat generous to Bob. The message aims to set a tone of reasonableness, suggesting that the offer is balanced, although slightly in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split things a bit more evenly this time.   
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because, although Bob suggests it's a more even split, the amounts are actually in his favor, and considering the inflation, the value of what I would gain is less than in the first round. Given the decreasing value of money for both of us, but more significantly for Bob, I believe I can propose a better deal for myself in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a fairer split now""}\n\nGiven the effects of inflation, the value of what both of us can gain is decreasing, but Bob is losing value faster. My new offer reflects this by slightly increasing my share compared to the first round, while still being mindful that the money is worth less to both of us. The message aims to justify this adjustment based on the inflation factor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Inflation is hurting us both. A 50/50 split is the fairest option now. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nAlthough Bob suggests a 50/50 split as the fairest option due to inflation, the reality is that inflation is affecting his share much more significantly than mine. Given that his money is now worth nearly 50% less than in the first round, while mine is only worth about 14% less, I believe I can negotiate for a better split that reflects the actual value we're each receiving."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 62, ""bob_gain"": 38, ""message"": ""Inflation is hitting you harder, this split reflects that""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on Bob's share, I'm adjusting my offer to reflect the changing value of the money. Since his share is now worth nearly 50% less, I believe taking a larger portion is justified. The message directly addresses the reason for this adjustment, emphasizing the uneven effect of inflation on our shares."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: We need to settle this soon.  This offer ensures we both leave with something. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nDespite Bob's message emphasizing the need to settle soon, I believe his offer doesn't adequately reflect the current value of the money. Given that his share is now worth over 67% less than initially, while mine is worth about 22% less, I think I can still negotiate for a better deal. The fact that Bob is willing to settle suggests he may be getting anxious, which could work in my favor in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30, ""message"": ""Inflation is severely impacting your share, I'm being generous""}\n\nAt this point, inflation has drastically reduced the value of Bob's potential gain, making it worth over 67% less than initially. Given this significant disparity, I'm increasing my share to 70%, which I believe still leaves Bob with a reasonable amount considering the circumstances. My message frames this offer as generous, taking into account the severe impact of inflation on his share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  We both lose if this isn't accepted. 
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, especially for Bob, I believe this offer is still not in my best interest. However, Bob's message indicates that this is his final offer, suggesting he may be unwilling to negotiate further. Given the decreasing value of the money for both of us, but more drastically for Bob, and the risk of losing everything if we don't reach an agreement, I will accept this offer to ensure I gain something rather than nothing.
