"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 20%. My message is a friendly invitation to accept the offer and end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  Accept this and we can both walk away happy. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my potential gain is now worth 20% less than the original $100, so the effective amount I would get is $64 (80% of $80).

Bob's offer is to split it evenly, which would give me $50. Since $50 is more than the $64 I would get if I were to make another offer, I think this is a good deal.
