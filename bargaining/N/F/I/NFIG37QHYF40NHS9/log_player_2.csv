Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but this is getting ridiculous. Meet me in the middle just a little bit - we're losing money with every round! 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** I'm holding out for a 50/50 split. While it's true we are losing money due to inflation, I believe Alice will eventually concede to an even split rather than risk getting nothing at all.  I'm willing to play a bit more ""hardball"" to secure what I believe is the fairest outcome."
