"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering inflation, this 50.4-49.6 split is fair 
# Bob gain: 4960 
# Alice gain: 5040 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is now barely better than what I offered her last round, and waiting any longer will only make things worse due to inflation.  It's smarter to take the slightly smaller amount now."
