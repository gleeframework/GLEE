"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 4:1, fair and simple.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, hoping he'll accept and we can finish the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a more even split is fairer. Let's try 60/40. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not sure if 60/40 is a good deal for me, considering the inflation is eating away at the value of the money. I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal before the inflation gets worse.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're not getting the better deal, take it or leave it!""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise. Let's split it 55/45. It's closer to your proposal, and we can avoid further rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! I'm not sure if 55/45 is a good deal, but I'm getting desperate. I'll accept this offer.
