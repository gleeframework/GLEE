100000.0,900000.0,"I appreciate your generous offer, Alice, but I think we can find a more equitable solution. I'm proposing we split the money almost evenly, giving me a slightly larger share to compensate for the inflation that will likely affect me more than you.",Bob,2,

400000.0,600000.0,"Alice, I'm willing to take a smaller share than my initial proposal to show that I'm serious about finding a compromise.  Let's split the money 60/40, and both of us can walk away with a decent amount.  Time is running out, and the inflation will only hurt us both further.",Bob,4,
