Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing a 990,000-10,000 split in my favor.  I figure Bob might be willing to accept this since it's a small amount of money for him, and I'm taking the risk of inflation eating into my share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'm not happy about getting only 500,000, it's better than risking further inflation and potentially getting even less in the next round. This is a fair split given the circumstances."
