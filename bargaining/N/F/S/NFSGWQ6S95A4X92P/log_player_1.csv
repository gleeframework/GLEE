  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start to the game!""

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"

# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I see Bob is trying to take advantage of my initial proposal!

I'll reject this offer. I was looking for a more even split, and Bob's offer is still biased towards him. I'd like to propose a new offer in the next round.
