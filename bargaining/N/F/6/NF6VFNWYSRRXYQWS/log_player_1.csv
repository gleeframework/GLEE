"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get 60% of the money, and Bob gets 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 60% of the original amount, so I'll consider the offer in terms of the original amount.

Since Bob's offer is the same as my initial offer, I'll reject it.

```

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim to get a larger share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get 70% of the money, which is a bit more than my initial offer."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 52.2% of the original amount. Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

Original amount: $300,000
Original value: $300,000 / 0.482 = $622,111.35 (in today's value)

This is a decent offer, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get. I'll reject it for now.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000
}
```

This way, I'm trying to get 75% of the money, which is a bit more aggressive than my previous offers."

Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 32.77% of the original amount. Considering Bob's offer, I'll calculate the actual value I'd get:

Original amount: $250,000
Original value: $250,000 / 0.6723 = $370,311.65 (in today's value)

This is a relatively small share, but I'm running out of rounds and I don't want to risk getting nothing. I'll accept this offer.
