I'm going to offer Alice a better deal, but I'm also going to keep a larger share for myself. I'm hoping she'll see that it's in her best interest to accept this offer rather than risk getting nothing at all if we reach the end of the game."

This time, I'm going to offer Alice a slightly better deal than she offered me in the last round. However, I'm still keeping the majority of the money for myself. I want to see if she will accept the offer or if she is going to try and push for a better deal."
