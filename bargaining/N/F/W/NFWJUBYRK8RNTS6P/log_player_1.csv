"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, I'm fair""
}
```

I'm offering to take 80% of the original $100, and Bob will get 20%. I'm framing it as a fair split, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55-45 split is more fair, given that the money will lose value for both of us in future rounds. Let's be practical and end this quickly. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced that a 55-45 split is more fair, especially considering the initial offer I made was already a generous 80-20 split. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Inflation has taken its toll, and the money is worth even less now. I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're being too greedy, I'm offering a slightly better deal. Take it or leave it.""
}
```

I'm taking a slightly smaller share, but still trying to get the better end of the deal."
