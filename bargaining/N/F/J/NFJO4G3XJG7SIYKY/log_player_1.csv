"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair. I propose a 45/55 split.  This is a good starting point and allows us both to get a fair share. 
# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
