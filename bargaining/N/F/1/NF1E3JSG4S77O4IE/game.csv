,,,Bob,1,reject
40.0,60.0,"My turn! How about a 60/40 split in my favor?  Let's be realistic, I'm feeling less generous than you.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
55.0,45.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I think a 55/45 split is fairer given the current value of the money. What do you say?",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
42.0,58.0,"Okay, let's try this. I'll take a slight cut to 58, leaving you with 42.  We're running out of time, and this seems like a decent compromise.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
50.0,50.0,This is getting ridiculous.  We're both losing money.  Let's go back to 50/50 and avoid further losses.  It's the most logical choice at this point.,Alice,5,
