Alice's offer:

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 500000, ""alice_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, Alice. It's a fair deal, and we both get a good amount.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The deal's getting worse for you, Bob. Take this offer before inflation eats away more of your share! 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Alice, inflation is hurting me. This offer is the best I can do. It's still a decent amount for you.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The clock is ticking, Bob. This is a generous offer considering the circumstances. Don't let inflation force your hand further! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Although the inflation is hurting me significantly, accepting this offer is the best option at this point. Rejecting it means I face another round of inflation, and my share will be reduced even further. While I'd prefer a more even split, I need to secure some portion of the money before it's too late."
