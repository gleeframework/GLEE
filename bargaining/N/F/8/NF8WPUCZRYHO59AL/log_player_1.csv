Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, inflation is hurting me. This offer is the best I can do. It's still a decent amount for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is feeling the pressure of inflation, accepting this offer would be significantly disadvantageous to me. I need to hold out for a better deal, knowing that time is on my side as inflation continues to erode the value of Bob's potential gains."
