While the offer is slightly better than the previous one, I believe I can still secure a better deal. The inflation is increasing, but I'm not willing to settle for such a small share. I'm confident that I can negotiate a more equitable distribution in the remaining rounds."

The inflation is clearly starting to have a significant impact on Bob's share, yet he continues to offer me a disproportionately small amount.  I'm still confident I can get a better deal, and I'm unwilling to accept such an unfair distribution at this stage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}
```

With only a few rounds remaining, I need to be more aggressive while remaining reasonable. I'm increasing my offer again, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation.  I believe this offer is still fair, considering the rapidly decreasing value of Bob's share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10

# Alice gain: 25 
# Bob gain: 75 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, considering the inflation. While I'm starting to feel the pressure, I believe I can still secure a better deal in the remaining rounds.  I'm not willing to settle for such a small share, especially with the knowledge that Bob's gains are significantly diminished by inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 10.
Round 11
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}

We're nearing the end, and I'm adjusting my offer to be more aggressive.  Bob's share is significantly impacted by inflation, so I'm pushing for a larger share.  However, I'm still willing to compromise to avoid losing everything."
