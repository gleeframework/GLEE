"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a starting point, don't you think? 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's be more realistic. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. Time is ticking, and we both lose with every round.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, that's a tough deal for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to 56/44, but I need a larger share to account for the faster inflation hitting my end. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

Even with the faster inflation for me, Alice is getting a significantly larger share. I need to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5100, ""alice_gain"": 4900, ""message"": ""Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I understand you're feeling the inflation, but so am I. 51/49 is my final offer. Take it or leave it.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're running out of time! This back and forth is pointless. I'm serious about needing a larger share due to the inflation disparity. 53/47 is my absolute bottom line. Let's be reasonable and close this deal! 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 

This is a tough one, but with time running out and inflation eating away at the value, accepting Alice's offer of 53/47 is the most logical choice.  

Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  We're at round 5 with only 7 rounds left. The longer this drags on, the less we both get.
* **Inflation Impact:** While 47% isn't ideal, the rapid inflation for me means that waiting any longer could result in an even worse deal. 
* **Alice's Stance:** Her message suggests she won't budge further. Holding out for a better deal might result in us both getting nothing.

It's frustrating to settle for less, but sometimes a compromise is necessary to avoid a complete loss."
