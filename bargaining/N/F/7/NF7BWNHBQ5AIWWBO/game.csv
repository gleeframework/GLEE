6000.0,4000.0,"Let's be fair, Bob. A 60/40 split seems reasonable for a starting point, don't you think?",Alice,1,
,,,Bob,1,reject
4500.0,5500.0,"Okay, Alice, let's be more realistic. I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. Time is ticking, and we both lose with every round.",Bob,2,
,,,Alice,2,reject
5600.0,4400.0,"Bob, that's a tough deal for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to 56/44, but I need a larger share to account for the faster inflation hitting my end. This is my final offer.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
4900.0,5100.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. I understand you're feeling the inflation, but so am I. 51/49 is my final offer. Take it or leave it.",Bob,4,
,,,Alice,4,reject
5300.0,4700.0,"Bob, we're running out of time! This back and forth is pointless. I'm serious about needing a larger share due to the inflation disparity. 53/47 is my absolute bottom line. Let's be reasonable and close this deal!",Alice,5,
