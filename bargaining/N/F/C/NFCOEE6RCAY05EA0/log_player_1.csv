"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is 40% of the original $10,000. I'm hoping he'll accept this reasonable offer and we can wrap up the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take it! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $3,000 is actually worth 60% of the original $4,000 I offered in the first round, which is a significant decrease.

Considering Bob's offer, I'm not sure if I want to accept it. I'm still getting a decent amount, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, the money is worth even less now. I'll make a new offer that takes this into account. Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, let's end this""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $5,500, which is 55% of the original $10,000. I'm hoping this offer is more to his liking."
