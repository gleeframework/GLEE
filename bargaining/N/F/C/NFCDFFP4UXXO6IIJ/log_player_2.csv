Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want to maximize our gains.  Let's stop wasting time and split this evenly.  A 50/50 split ensures we both walk away with a significant sum before inflation eats further into our potential winnings. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
