"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's split the difference!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm being fair, but I'll try to do better 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, the offer of $500,000 is actually worth $450,000 to me. 

I'll accept Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
