"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

This way, I get the majority of the money, but still give Bob a decent amount to make it worth his while to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I don't think this offer is as good as mine was, and I'd rather wait for a better deal. I'll reject Bob's offer.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Time to make a new offer!

Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a slightly more balanced split this time. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 540000,
  ""bob_gain"": 460000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on my offer's value!

Considering the offer is now more balanced, and the money is worth less in total, I think it's a good opportunity to accept. I'll take the deal.
