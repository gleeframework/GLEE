"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take most of the money this time, but next round you can make the offer. 
# Bob gain: 10 
# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

It's better to reject this offer. While a quick 10 dollars is tempting, it's risky. We have 12 rounds, and with inflation, the value of the money will decrease. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate a more equitable deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 50, ""alice_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money evenly. It's a good starting point for both of us.""}
