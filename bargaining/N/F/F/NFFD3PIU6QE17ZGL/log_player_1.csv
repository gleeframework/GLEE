"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 80% of the $100 and Bob gets 20%. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. It's the fairest way to go, and we can both be happy. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 5% less than the original $80, which is $76.

Bob's offer is to split the money evenly, with each of us getting $50. I'm not sure if this is the best deal for me, considering the inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate for a better deal. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not sure splitting it evenly is the best for me, Bob. I'd like to propose a better deal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, my gain is now worth 10% less than the original $80, which is $72.

I'll make a new offer to Bob:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, Bob. Let's see if you'll accept this offer.""
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the $100 and Bob gets 40%. This is a slightly more generous offer than the previous one, but I'm still trying to maximize my gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a little more than last time, Alice. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is now worth 14.26% less than the original $80, which is approximately $68.48.

Bob's new offer is to give me $40 and keep $60. Considering the inflation, this is a slightly better deal for me than his previous offer.

I'll accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, Bob. I think this is a good compromise. I'll accept your offer.""
}
