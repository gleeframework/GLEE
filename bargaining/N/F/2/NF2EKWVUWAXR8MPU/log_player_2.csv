"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game early. 
# Bob gain: 2000 
# Alice gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 

It's tempting to accept an early offer, but 8000 is a lot of money for Alice to take.  Let's see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Let's be fair.  I'm offering you a good share, but we need to work together to avoid losing money to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'll meet you in the middle. Let's split it 50/50 and avoid further negotiations. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

It's looking like a 50/50 split is the most likely outcome here.  I'd rather get 5000 now than risk getting less due to inflation."
