"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I'm the one who's going to make the big gains! 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, as I'd be getting only $200,000 and Bob would be getting $800,000. I'm hoping to do better than that. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."

# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Ugh, this offer is even worse than the previous one! I'd be getting a paltry $100,000, while Bob would be getting a whopping $900,000. I'm not going to accept this offer, especially considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'll reject this offer and try to do better in the next round."
