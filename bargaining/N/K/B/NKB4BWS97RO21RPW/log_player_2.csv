"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I think we should split the money evenly. Inflation is affecting both of us, and a 50/50 split is the fairest way to go forward.  Let's end this now and avoid further devaluation. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
