Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is fair, given the inflation we need to consider. I'm willing to take a slight advantage this round to make up for the future devaluation of your share. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
