"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 75,
  ""bob_gain"": 25,
  ""message"": ""I propose we divide the $100 with a 75/25 split. This gives us both a reasonable share while considering the decreasing value of money in subsequent rounds.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a slightly larger share. This 60/40 split gives me a bit more wiggle room to adapt to the decreasing value of money. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{
