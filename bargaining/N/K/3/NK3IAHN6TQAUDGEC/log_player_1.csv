"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 95, ""bob_gain"": 5}
```

I'm proposing to keep the majority of the money for myself.  Since it's the first round, I'm not overly concerned about inflation yet.  But, I'll be watching how Bob reacts to my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob is taking advantage of the inflation!  I'll reject this offer and counter with a more equitable split in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55}
```

I'm offering a more even split now. While I'm still feeling the sting of inflation, I'm willing to compromise to avoid getting nothing at all. Hopefully, Bob sees this as a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has taken a bigger chunk out of my potential earnings, Bob's offer isn't terrible.  It's still a loss compared to the initial round, but accepting this avoids the risk of getting nothing at all in the later rounds."
