I'm Bob and I want a better deal than 5$.  Let's see what Alice proposes next."

I'm going to try to be fair, but I'm also going to try to get the most money possible.  Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 55 
# Alice gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with this deal.  I'll see what I can get in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to try and be more generous this time, but I'm still hoping for a better split than the last few rounds."
