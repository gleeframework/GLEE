Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer was heavily skewed in your favor.  Let's be realistic. My turn to propose a more reasonable split that considers the inflation disparity -  70/30. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
