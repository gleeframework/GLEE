"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

This is a classic game theory scenario where you need to balance being greedy with ensuring you don't get stuck with a bad deal later. 

Since I'm playing as Alice, I'm going to offer Bob a tiny amount ($1) and keep the vast majority for myself.  This is because I know that with each round, the money will become less valuable to me, so I want to secure as much as possible now. 

Bob can either accept this offer (and we're done), or reject it and get to propose a split in the next round. If he rejects, I'll have to consider the 5% devaluation of the money and make a more ""fair"" offer to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```

While I'd prefer to have more, the 5% devaluation is starting to hurt. Accepting this offer is the best option.  It's a fair split and I don't want to risk getting stuck with an even worse offer in the next round."
