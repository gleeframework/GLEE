"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This offer gives me the majority of the money while still leaving Bob with a small share. It's a reasonable starting point, especially considering the inflation factor that will favor me in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This is a much worse deal for me than the previous round, even considering the inflation.  Bob is taking a much larger share, and while I'm losing less value from inflation, the overall share I'm getting is significantly smaller. I'll reject and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

This offer is a slight compromise from my initial offer, acknowledging that Bob's offer was too one-sided.  I still believe I should get the larger share, but I'm willing to give up some ground to avoid further rounds of inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

This offer is still far worse for me than my initial proposal, even with the inflation. Despite losing a lot of value, I'm still getting a larger share in my proposed offer. I'll keep rejecting until I can secure a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still aiming for a majority share. The inflation is starting to affect my potential gains significantly, so I need to find a balance between securing a good deal and avoiding further rounds of lost value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still too far from what I consider a fair split. I believe I can still get a better deal, especially considering the significant inflation impacting Bob's share. I'll reject and try to get a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

This offer further reduces my share, but I believe it's necessary to reach an agreement soon. With each passing round, the inflation will drastically reduce the value of the money, and it's becoming riskier to keep rejecting offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This offer is the best I've seen so far, even with the inflation, and it's getting quite risky to keep rejecting. While I prefer a larger share, the potential for both of us getting nothing is a bigger concern."
