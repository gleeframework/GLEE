"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point to me."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with Bob's offer. I was hoping for a more equitable split, and giving me only $2,000 while keeping $8,000 for himself is not acceptable. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's still fair""}

I'm proposing a slightly more lopsided split, giving Bob a smaller share of $4,000, while I take $6,000. I hope this offer is more acceptable to Bob."

# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled with Bob's offer again. I was hoping for a better deal, especially considering the money is worth less than it was initially due to inflation. Giving me $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for himself is still not a good split in my opinion. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again."

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm proposing a split that gives Bob a slightly larger share of $3,000, while I take $7,000. I'm trying to find a compromise that works for both of us, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal."

# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm really disappointed with Bob's offer again. At this point, the money is worth significantly less than it was initially, and I'm not willing to accept a split that gives me only $3,000 while Bob takes $7,000. I think I deserve a better deal, especially considering the value of the money has decreased so much. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again."

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve the majority""}

I'm proposing a split that gives me the majority of the money, $8,000, while Bob takes $2,000. I'm trying to be more aggressive in my negotiation, as the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. I hope Bob will accept this offer."

I'm proposing a split that gives me the majority of the money, $9,000, while Bob takes only $1,000. I'm being very aggressive in my negotiation, as the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. I hope Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not optimistic."
