"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it and we can end the game here."
