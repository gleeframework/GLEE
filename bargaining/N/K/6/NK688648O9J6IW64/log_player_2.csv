"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous. Take $1,000 and call it a day. We can both get richer in the next rounds! 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 999000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a terrible deal for me! While Alice is being slightly humorous talking about getting richer with such a small amount, she's clearly trying to take the vast majority of the money.  I'm confident I can negotiate a much better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money relatively evenly, with a slight advantage to me for starting negotiations. This ensures we both benefit significantly.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still feeling generous. Let's split it 55/45 in my favor, reflecting my initial proposal. We can both walk away with a substantial amount before inflation eats away more of our potential gains. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is sticking very close to her initial unfair offer. It's clear she's feeling the pressure from inflation but not willing to negotiate reasonably yet.  I need to show her I'm serious about getting a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 525000,
""alice_gain"": 475000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic. We're running out of time, and inflation is eating away at our potential gains. I'm proposing a 52.5/47.5 split. It's a strong offer that ensures you still get a significant amount. Let's close this deal and avoid walking away with nothing.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be practical. We're both losing money with each passing round.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on your last offer.  This gives us both a good outcome, and avoids the risk of getting nothing at all. 
# Bob gain: 475000 
# Alice gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

Alice is finally negotiating realistically. While I'd prefer a slightly better split, accepting this offer guarantees a significant sum that's still better than what I was initially offered. Continuing to push my luck could backfire, especially with inflation eroding our potential gains."
