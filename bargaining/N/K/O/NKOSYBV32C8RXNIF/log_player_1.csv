"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split in my favor is fair. This ensures both of us get a decent share, and considering inflation, it's a better deal than your initial offer. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
