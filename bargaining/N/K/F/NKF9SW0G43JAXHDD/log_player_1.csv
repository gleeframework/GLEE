"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, as it's a fair and straightforward way to divide the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think it's a fair start 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about the 60/40 split, and I think I can do better. I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 450000, ""bob_gain"": 550000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly better offer, but I think I deserve a bit more""}

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my proposal, but still being reasonable. I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I think 55/45 is a fairer split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think it's a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting a bit concerned about the value of the money decreasing, and Bob's offer is getting more and more one-sided. I think I can do better, and I'll reject this offer. I'll try to make a more aggressive proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 320000, ""bob_gain"": 680000, ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of""}

I'm trying to be more aggressive in my proposal, and I'm willing to give Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm not going to give in too easily. I think 32/68 is a fair compromise, considering the decreasing value of the money."
