{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 60, you take 40.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point."

# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, but I'll think carefully about it. After considering the inflation factor, I realize that the value of the money I'll gain is decreasing faster than Bob's. I might as well take what I can get.

{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'll accept Bob's offer, hoping that I can still salvage something from this negotiation."
