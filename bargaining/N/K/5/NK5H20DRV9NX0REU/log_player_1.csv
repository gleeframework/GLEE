"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, with me getting $600,000 and Bob getting $400,000. My message to Bob is that I think we can split the money fairly and there's no need to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still fair 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my expectations.

I'll reject this offer. I'd rather wait for the next round, as I think I can get a better deal. The money is still worth more than it will be in the next round, so it's worth waiting.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 480000,
  ""bob_gain"": 520000,
  ""message"": ""I'll meet you in the middle, let's finalize""
}
```

My message to Bob is that I'm willing to meet him halfway, with me getting $480,000 and Bob getting $520,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's compromise, 50/50, no more negotiations 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money.

I'll accept Bob's offer. With the money being worth even less, a 50/50 split is actually a good deal for me. I'd rather take the $500,000 now than risk waiting and getting even less in value.
