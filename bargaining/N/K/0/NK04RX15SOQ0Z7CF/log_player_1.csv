"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $1,000,000, and Bob gets 40%. This is a relatively fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my potential gain is now worth 5% less than the original amount, and Bob's gain is worth 10% less.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, but I'll have to consider it. Since I rejected Bob's offer in the first round, I'm trying to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject this offer for now.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Since I rejected Bob's offer in the second round, it's now my turn to make a new proposal. Considering the inflation adjustment, I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm proposing that I get 55% of the adjusted $1,000,000, and Bob gets 45%. This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but I'm hoping Bob will accept it this time!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the adjusted values, my potential gain is now worth 14.26% less than the original amount, and Bob's gain is worth 27.1% less.

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer. I'm still trying to negotiate a better deal for myself. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation adjustment, my potential gain is worth even less than before. I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more even distribution of the adjusted $1,000,000. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm also prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money! With the adjusted values, my potential gain is now worth 22.62% less than the original amount, and Bob's gain is worth 40.95% less.

Considering the significant decrease in value, I'm starting to feel a bit desperate. However, I still want to try to get a better deal for myself. I'll reject this offer, hoping that Bob will make a more favorable offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","With the inflation adjustment, my potential gain is worth even less than before. I'll aim for a higher share to compensate for the decrease in value, but I'm running out of room to negotiate.

Here's my offer for Round 7:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is similar to my initial offer in Round 1. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm not getting my hopes up."
