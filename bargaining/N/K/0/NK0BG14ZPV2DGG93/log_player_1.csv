"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I propose a 90/10 split, with me receiving $900,000 and Bob receiving $100,000.  This seems like a fair starting point, given that my offer values the money less than Bob's in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000} 
```

I'm offering a 75/25 split, which is a more even division than Bob's last offer, but still accounts for the fact that my money is losing value faster than his."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is more generous than in the previous round, it is still not a fair division given the rate at which the money is depreciating for me. I will continue to negotiate for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm offering a 60/40 split in my favor, which is a compromise from my previous offer. This reflects the increasing depreciation of my money, while also being a more reasonable division than Bob's recent offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still not fair, given the rapid depreciation of my money.  I need to keep negotiating for a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000} 
```

I'm offering a 55/45 split in my favor. This offer takes into account the significant depreciation of my money and represents a more balanced division than Bob's previous offers.  It also acknowledges that we are nearing the end of the game, and it would be beneficial for both of us to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 52.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting worse, and while the inflation is hurting him more, my share is still declining at a rate that makes this offer unacceptable.  I need to keep negotiating for a better outcome."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000} 
```

With only a few rounds left, I propose a 50/50 split. This is the fairest division given the extreme inflation we are both facing. It's a win-win for both of us, as we would both get something rather than risk getting nothing at all."
