Let's see if Alice will be willing to negotiate further.  Since the money is worth less with each round, I'm going to try to get a better deal for myself."

# Alice gain: 58

I'm still not happy with this offer.  Even with inflation, I think I can get a better deal if I keep rejecting and push for a more even split."

I'm still going to reject. Even though the inflation is hitting me harder, I'm going to try to hold out for a better deal. I think I can get more than 40, even with the decreasing value of the money."
