"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split is fair considering the decreasing value of the money. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
It's too early to accept an offer that heavily favors Alice, especially considering the rapid devaluation of my share. I want to see if I can negotiate a better deal for myself in the following rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I think a more balanced split is fairer, considering we both lose money over time.  Let's start with this offer and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, your offer doesn't reflect the faster rate of inflation you face. This amount gives us both a chance for a decent share while it still holds value. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer a more even split, Alice's offer is reasonable given the significant devaluation of my share and the limited number of rounds remaining. Accepting this offer ensures I receive a sizable amount, though smaller than I initially hoped for, before the money becomes even less valuable."
