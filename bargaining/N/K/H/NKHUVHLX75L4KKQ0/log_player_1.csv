"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, my gain of $80 is now worth $64 (80% of $80), and Bob's gain of $20 is now worth $18 (90% of $20).

Considering Bob's new offer, I think it's a good deal for me. I'll accept it.
