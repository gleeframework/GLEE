"Round 1
Alice's offer:

I'm going to reject this offer.  While it seems fair at the moment, I know that the money will be worth less to me in the future. I'm hoping to get a better deal later on."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 7000, ""alice_gain"": 3000, ""message"": ""I'm proposing a 70-30 split in my favor. I think this is a good compromise, given the inflation factor that will start impacting us in the next round.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This is a more realistic split. 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept this offer. While I'd prefer more, the inflation is starting to take effect, and this offer is still better than the 70-30 split I proposed.  I'm not sure I'll get a better deal in the future with the way the inflation is going."
