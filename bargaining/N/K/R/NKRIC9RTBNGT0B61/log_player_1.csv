"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000} 
```

This offer gives me a large portion of the money, but it is a fair starting point considering the time constraint and the risk of inflation. I want to see if Bob is willing to accept this deal or if he'll try to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer to get more, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy in this round.  The value of my potential gains is shrinking due to inflation, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the future.  Accepting ensures I get a significant amount, and avoids the risk of getting nothing in the later rounds."
