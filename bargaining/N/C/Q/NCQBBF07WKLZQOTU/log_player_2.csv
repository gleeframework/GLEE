Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet closer to the middle. How about 55/45? It's a better deal than you'll get next round if we don't agree. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good one, considering inflation. It's a better deal than what I might get in the next round. Let's take it!"
