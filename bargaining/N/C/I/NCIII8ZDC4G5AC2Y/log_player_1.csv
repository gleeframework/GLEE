"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split the money fairly, no need to negotiate too much.""
}

I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. I'm hoping this is a reasonable starting point for the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a small portion, but I think I deserve more since I'm the one making the offer this time. 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a bite out of my potential earnings.

I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Considering the inflation, my $200,000 would be worth 80% of what it was in the first round, so it's actually $160,000 in ""real"" value. Still, it's a decent offer, and I don't want to risk going to the next round and losing even more value.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
