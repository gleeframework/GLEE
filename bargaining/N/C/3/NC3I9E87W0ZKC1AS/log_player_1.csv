"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start with a generous offer. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

This way, I'll get 60% of the initial $100, and Bob will get 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already affecting me!

I'll think carefully... Considering that I'll be getting 40% of the remaining money, which is worth 20% less than in the previous round, I'll calculate my actual gain as 40% of 80% of the initial $100, which is 0.4 * 0.8 * 100 = $32.

I'll decide to reject this offer. The potential gain is not enough for me.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll make a new offer. Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher percentage to compensate for the decreasing value of the money.

Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45}

This way, I'll get a slightly higher percentage, but still leave some room for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!

Let's calculate my potential gain in this offer. The money is worth 51.2% of its original value (100% - 48.8%), and I'll be getting 30% of that. So, my actual gain would be 0.3 * 0.512 * 100 = $15.36.

Considering the decreasing value of the money, I think this offer is reasonable. I'll decide to accept this offer.
