"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a simple split. I get $6,000 and you get $4,000. It's a good deal for both of us considering the inflation.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, let's meet in the middle. I understand you want a larger share, but time is ticking and the money is losing value. This offer still gives you a good chunk. 
# Bob gain: 4400 
# Alice gain: 5600 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to anchor the negotiations in her favor. While the offer is slightly better, accepting now sets a precedent that she can lowball me. The inflation hurts her more than me, so waiting is strategically advantageous."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5200,
""alice_gain"": 4800,
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close, but this needs to be fair. My offer gives us both a decent gain considering the shrinking pot. Let's close this deal and not risk losing out.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  I've slightly reduced my demand from $5500 to $5200, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Urgency:** Highlighting the shrinking pot due to inflation adds pressure for Alice to accept a deal sooner.
* **Framing:** Positioning the offer as a win-win for both parties can make it more palatable for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  My offer is fair and the clock is ticking.  Let's be realistic and end this before the inflation eats away at the value any further. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice is right - time is becoming a significant factor.  Continuing to hold out for a marginally better deal is risky. Accepting now guarantees a reasonable sum, even with the inflation factored in. It's better to secure a decent gain than risk getting nothing at all."
