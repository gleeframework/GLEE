Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, but let's acknowledge the inflation. I'm willing to split it slightly in your favor, but I need to get a good deal too. This helps us both avoid losing money from waiting. 
# Alice gain: 475000 
# Bob gain: 525000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
