Let's see if Bob is greedy or if he's willing to split things a little more fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
I'm going to reject this offer.  Although I'm getting a much larger amount of money, Bob is getting much more than he was offering before.  I'm betting that he'll be forced to give me a better deal later."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000} 
```

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower share than he offered me in the last round, but I'm still giving him a significant amount. I'm hoping this will be enough to entice him to accept the offer and avoid another round of inflation."

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

I'm going to reject again. Even though inflation has hurt Bob's offer, it's still too lopsided in his favor. I'm going to hold out for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}

I'm going to increase my share again, but still offer Bob a decent amount. I'm hoping that the combination of increasing inflation and my consistent rejection of his offers will finally convince him to accept."

Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}

I'm going to offer Bob a slightly lower share than before, but still a substantial amount. I'm hoping that the pressure of inflation, combined with his consistent rejections, will finally push him towards accepting a deal that's closer to fairness."
