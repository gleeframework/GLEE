I'm going to be greedy and offer Bob a small amount.  I want to see if he'll accept it in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While my share is smaller, the inflation means I'll get less if we continue to the next round. It's better to take what I can get now."
