"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose to take 900,000 and give Bob 100,000.  It's a pretty generous offer, especially considering the inflation we'll both face if we keep playing.  Let's see if he's reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'm not happy with getting only 200,000, it's better than nothing.  Since inflation is hitting me harder than Bob, it's likely the offers will get worse if I reject."
