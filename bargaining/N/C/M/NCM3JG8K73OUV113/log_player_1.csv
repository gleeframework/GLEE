"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I'll give you a decent amount for your first proposal.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $100, which is a relatively generous offer for the first round. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair, given the value of money might be decreasing.  Let's see what you think. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less in the second round, the actual amounts I would gain are:

* Alice gain: 40 * 0.9 = 36
* Bob gain: 60 * 0.9 = 54

Considering the decreased value of money, I think Bob's offer is still quite generous. I'll accept it.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
