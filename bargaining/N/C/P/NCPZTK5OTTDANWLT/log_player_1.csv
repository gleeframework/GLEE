Send your offer to divide $100.","I'll start by making an offer. Here's my proposal:

{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, I'd rather take this offer. Here's my response:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
