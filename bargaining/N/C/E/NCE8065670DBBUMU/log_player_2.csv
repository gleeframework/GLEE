Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, it's clear we both want this money. Let's stop wasting time and split it evenly. A 50/50 split is the fairest and ensures we both get a good deal before inflation eats away at it further. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000
