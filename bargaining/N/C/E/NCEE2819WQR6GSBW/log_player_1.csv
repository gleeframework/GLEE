"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! I'll give you 10, I'll take 90.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $10 and keeping $90 for myself. This is a relatively small amount for Bob, so I'm hoping he'll accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll start with a fair offer. You can do better than this! 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less, I'll have to be more careful with my decisions.

Considering Bob's offer, I'll reject it. I think I can do better than 20$ for myself, especially since the money is worth less each round. I'll make my own offer in the next round.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further.""
}
```

I'm making a fair offer, suggesting a 50/50 split. This way, we both get an equal share of the money, and we can end the game quickly."
