"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, where we each get $5,000. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly biased start, but I'm willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not thrilled about Bob's offer, as it's not very fair. I was hoping for a more balanced split. I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to accept an offer that gives Bob a 2:1 advantage. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4500, ""bob_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly bigger share, but not too much!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, which is still slightly in my favor, but I'm trying to be more conciliatory after Bob's previous offer. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting a bit more aggressive, but still willing to compromise 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm getting a bit frustrated with Bob's aggressive offers. I'm not willing to accept an offer that gives him a 6:3 advantage. I'm starting to feel like I'm being taken advantage of. I'll wait for the next round to make a new proposal and try to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no more games""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split again, but this time I'm being more direct and straightforward. I'm hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway."
