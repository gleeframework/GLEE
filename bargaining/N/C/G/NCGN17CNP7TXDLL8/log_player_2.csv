"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. I'm offering you 40% - take it or leave it. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. The 5% inflation won't hurt me too much, and maybe Alice will be more willing to compromise. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\nI'll try to take advantage of Alice's higher inflation rate and make a slightly more aggressive offer.\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Come on, Alice, I'm being generous. You're losing more value each round, don't be stubborn!""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The tides are turning, Bob. I'm feeling generous, so I'll offer you 45% before inflation eats away at your potential gains even further. 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\nI'll think carefully about this one... Considering the inflation, Alice's offer of 45% is actually a better deal for me than my own offer of 55% in the previous round. Since the money is worth less and less with each passing round, I think it's wise to accept this offer and secure my gains before they dwindle further.\n{""decision"": ""accept""}"
