"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

This is a fair offer that splits the money 90% to Alice and 10% to Bob. Since Bob has no inflation, he is likely to accept this deal as it's a positive gain for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I prefer more money, the inflation rate is making it increasingly difficult to get a good deal. Accepting this offer ensures I get at least 5000 dollars, even with inflation."
