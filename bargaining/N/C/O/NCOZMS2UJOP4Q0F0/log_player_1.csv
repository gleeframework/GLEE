Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a slightly unfair but reasonable offer. I'm taking the majority, but I'm giving Bob a small amount to hopefully encourage him to accept.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though I'm getting less than I wanted, it's still better than nothing.  Since the money is worth less for both of us, I need to take what I can get. Let's see how this plays out!"
