"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This offer leaves me with the lion's share, but gives you something upfront which will be worth less as time goes on due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 50000 
# Alice gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This offer is heavily skewed in Alice's favor. While getting something upfront is tempting, the devaluation means it's a tiny fraction of the total amount. I need to negotiate for a much fairer split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 700000,
""alice_gain"": 300000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be reasonable. I'm proposing a 70/30 split in my favor. It considers the time pressure and inflation, offering you a fair deal without dragging this out.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your last offer was heavily skewed in your favor. This is my final compromise - it still gives you a decent sum considering inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

This is still a bad deal. While Alice acknowledges the time pressure, she's not offering a significant enough increase to justify the massive difference in gains. I need to show I'm serious about getting a fairer share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, it's clear we both want this money. I'm coming down to 60/40 to find a compromise. This is a serious offer considering the increasing impact of inflation with each round."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. This offer is a serious compromise on my end, acknowledging the time pressure but also reflecting the fact that I'm losing out due to your inflation advantage. 
# Bob gain: 150000 
# Alice gain: 850000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is playing a clever game, framing her offer as a ""compromise"" while still heavily favoring herself.  A 150,000 gain might seem tempting with the increasing inflation, but it sets a dangerous precedent. I need to hold my ground a bit longer, hoping she gets more reasonable as we approach the deadline."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time, and each round makes the situation worse for me. I'm offering a 55/45 split. This is a significant concession on my part, and it's a fair deal given the circumstances. Let's end this before we both lose out.""
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 26.49% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, the clock is ticking. I'm holding firm on this offer. It's a fair reflection of the dwindling value of your potential gain.  Accept this, and we both walk away with something substantial. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

This is getting dangerous, but I can't accept such a low amount. Alice is clearly trying to pressure me with the deadline, but I have to believe she'd rather walk away with something than nothing. I need to show I'm willing to risk it all for a fair deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is it. A 50/50 split. It's the only fair offer given the circumstances.  Take it or leave it, but time is running out for both of us.""
