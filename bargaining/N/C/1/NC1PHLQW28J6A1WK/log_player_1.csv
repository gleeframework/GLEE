I'm going to propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  I think it's a fair starting point.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

A 50/50 split is fair, and the money is worth less now than it was in the first round. I'll take it!"
