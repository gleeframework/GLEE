"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I take the lion's share this time, but we'll see how the inflation affects things in the future. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### I'll wait for a better offer. The current one is too biased towards Alice. Inflation might make the money less valuable for me in the future, but I'm willing to take that risk in hopes of getting a larger share."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n### {""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's try a more balanced approach. I think 60-40 is a fair split considering the inflation that will affect my share over time.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I still need a larger share to compensate for the inflation that will affect you more heavily in later rounds. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob gain: 3000 
# Alice gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\n### I still think Alice's offer is too skewed in her favor. Given the inflation, I'm willing to take a risk for a potentially better offer in the future. The 19% decrease in value for me makes this offer less appealing, considering the overall value I'd receive is significantly less than what Alice gets."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation's impact on me, I'm willing to compromise further. A 55-45 split seems more reasonable, as it acknowledges the decreasing value of my share over time while still being fair to both parties.""}"
