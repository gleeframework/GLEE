"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm proposing an even split.  It's fair and straightforward, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, accepting this offer is the best strategy. If I reject, I'll be the one making the offer in the next round, but Bob will have an even greater advantage due to inflation.  It's better to take what I can get now."
