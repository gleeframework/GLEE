This is tough, but I have to accept.  Here's why:

* **Inflation is killing me:**  The longer this goes on, the less my share is worth. 
* **Alice is being ruthless:** She knows time is on her side and her offers are getting worse for me. 

Taking $405,000 now is better than risking an even worse deal in round 8, where the inflation will further erode my potential gains."
