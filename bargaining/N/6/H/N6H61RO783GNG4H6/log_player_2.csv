"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split fairly reflects the potential losses we both face from inflation as the game progresses. 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting this offer because I think I can get a better deal in the next round. Since the money is worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I believe Alice will be more motivated to make a more favorable offer to me as the game progresses. I'm willing to take the risk of losing some value to inflation in order to potentially gain a larger share of the money. Let's see what the next round brings!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","I'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the decreasing value of money for both of us. Since Alice is more affected by inflation, I'll try to find a balance that might appeal to her.\n\n###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. This offer should be more appealing as we both lose less value now than if we proceed.""}"
