"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the inflation, let's find a middle ground that benefits us both. This offer should be more appealing as we both lose less value now than if we proceed. 
# Alice gain: 5500 
# Bob gain: 4500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
