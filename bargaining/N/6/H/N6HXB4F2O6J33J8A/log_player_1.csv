This is a fairly even split, but it gives me a slight advantage. I want to see how Bob responds before getting too greedy!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation! I'm not going to accept this deal, even though it's a bit risky. I'll see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to try to split it a bit more in my favor. The inflation is working against me, so I want to make sure I get a good deal before the money becomes even less valuable."
