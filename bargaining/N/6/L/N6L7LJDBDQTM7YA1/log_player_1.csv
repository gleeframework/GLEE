"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
``` 

This is a fairly balanced offer, taking into account that Bob's money is worth less with each round. It's a good starting point to see if Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

This is a fair and balanced offer, especially considering the inflation that has already occurred.  It's in my best interest to accept and avoid further potential losses due to inflation."
