"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable, Bob. This offer leaves us both with a good amount. 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While this offer is tempting, it's better to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further. There's a lot of money on the table, and I can potentially get a better deal with more rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""Let's split this fairly.  I'm offering you 40% of the money.  This is a good starting point for us to reach an agreement.""} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want a fair split, Bob, but time is working against us both.  I'm willing to come down slightly.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob gain: 350000 
# Alice gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
While the offer is slightly better than the first round, I'm still holding out for a more even split. The time pressure is real, but I think I can still get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""I'm still hoping for a more even split.  I'm willing to compromise, but this is my final offer.  Let's settle this before we lose even more money to inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, our offers aren't that far apart now. I'm taking another hit on my share to get this done. Time is literally money for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

With each passing round, the money is worth less. While I'd prefer a more even split, this offer is getting close to my target. It's time to accept and secure some of the money before we both lose too much to inflation."
