"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my initial offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

This means I'm proposing that I get $6,000 and Bob gets $4,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 20% less due to inflation, I'll have to consider that when evaluating the offer.

My current proposal was for $6,000, but due to inflation, it's worth 80% of that, which is $4,800. Bob's proposal is $5,000, which is 100% of that, but still lower than my original proposal.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
