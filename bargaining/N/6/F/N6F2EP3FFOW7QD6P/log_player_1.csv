I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer, hoping to get this done quickly. I'm giving Bob $1,000, and keeping $9,000 for myself.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer a larger share, it's better to take this 50/50 split now. The inflation will only continue to erode the value of the money, and I'm not sure how many more rounds it will take for Bob to make a better offer."
