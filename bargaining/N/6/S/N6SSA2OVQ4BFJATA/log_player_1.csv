"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm starting with a proposal that gives me a large share, hoping Bob will accept to avoid further rounds and potential losses for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
While I would prefer a larger share, accepting this offer is better than risking further rounds and the continued devaluation of my gains."
