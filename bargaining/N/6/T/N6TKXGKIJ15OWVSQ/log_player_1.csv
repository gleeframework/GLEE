"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going for a pretty aggressive offer in the first round. I'll take $90 and give Bob $10. I figure he'll either accept it or be more likely to make a counter-offer that's fairer to both of us in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 10 
# Bob gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer. It's a huge swing in Bob's favor, and while I'm aware of the inflation, 5% less isn't enough for me to accept such a drastic change in the division. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm lowering my initial demand a bit. I'm still aiming for a majority, but this offer shows flexibility and might be more appealing to Bob after his previous attempt.  The 5% inflation is starting to bite, so I need to balance being assertive with being reasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting this offer. While it's still not ideal, it's a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer.  The inflation is really hurting now, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all.  It's time to be pragmatic."
