Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less, my initial reaction is that Bob's offer seems too generous. I'd rather not settle for 5000 each, especially since it's the same amount as the previous round, when the money was worth more.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the money being worth 10% less, I'll aim to get a bigger share. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is really losing value fast! With the reduced value, Bob's offer seems more reasonable now. However, I'm still not sure if I want to give up the potential for a bigger share.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The money is losing value rapidly! I'll try to get a bigger share while it's still worth something. Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is losing value so quickly! With the reduced value, Bob's offer seems even more reasonable now. I'm starting to think that I should consider accepting a smaller share to get some money rather than risking going home with nothing.
