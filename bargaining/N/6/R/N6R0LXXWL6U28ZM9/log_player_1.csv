"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'm willing to compromise.""
}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial 100$, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering we both get a decent amount. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of 40$ is worth 40% of the initial 100$, which is 0.4 * 100 = 40$. However, since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, it's actually worth 40 * 0.9 = 36$. 

I will reject the offer. 

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, no more negotiations.""
}
```

I'm aiming for a 50-50 split, hoping it's more appealing to Bob this time around."
