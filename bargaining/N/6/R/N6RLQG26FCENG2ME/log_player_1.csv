Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, I'll have to be more careful with my decision.

Since the money is worth 5% less for me, and Bob's offer is 50/50 split, I'll have to consider that I'll be getting less value out of my share.

I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation adjustment, I'll make a new offer. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll aim to get a larger share to compensate for the decrease in value.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up quickly!

With the money being worth 14.26% less for me, I'll have to be cautious about accepting an offer that's still a 60/40 split. I'll think carefully before making a decision.

After considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll reject this offer.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a toll on the value of the money!
