I'm not satisfied with the 50/50 split. I was hoping to get a better deal since I'm the one making the proposal in the next round. I'll reject this offer and hope to do better in the next round."

# Alice gain: 55 
# Bob gain: 45 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer of 45/55. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm not willing to risk going to another round with the money decreasing in value due to inflation. I'll take the 55% and hope it's enough!"
