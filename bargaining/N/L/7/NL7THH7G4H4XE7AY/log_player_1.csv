"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a moderate proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 4000, ""bob_gain"": 6000}

This way, I'll get 40% and Bob will get 60% of the initial $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","The offer from Bob is a bit more generous than mine, but still not as favorable as I'd like. Since the money is worth 5% less for me now, I'll have to consider the relative value of the offer.

I'll reject this offer for now.
