"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I think this is a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing that I get $60 and Bob gets $40. I think this is a fair starting point, and we can discuss and adjust as needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of either 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not happy with the 70-30 split, especially since the money is worth 10% less now. I'd like to propose a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 75, ""bob_gain"": 25, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more considering the original split was 60-40. This is my best offer.""}

I'm proposing a 75-25 split, which is a bit more favorable to me than Bob's previous offer, but still a compromise. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not getting a good deal at this point, but I'm willing to give you a slightly better offer to keep the game going 
# Alice gain: 78 
# Bob gain: 22 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm not thrilled about the 78-22 split, but considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is willing to give me a slightly better offer, I'll accept this one. Let's hope the next round will bring a better deal for me."
