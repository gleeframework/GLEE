Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: The value is decreasing quickly, Bob.  I'm willing to negotiate, but this offer reflects the urgency. 
# Bob gain: 3600 
# Alice gain: 6400 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still quite uneven, and I think I can push for a better deal.  The value is decreasing, but I'm not desperate yet."
