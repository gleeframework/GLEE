Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I think we can do better. Let's start with a 65/35 split, taking into account the potential for inflation in future rounds. 
# Alice gain: 35 
# Bob gain: 65 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your point about the diminishing value of the money.  Let's meet in the middle with a 60/40 split.  This will give us both a good amount, and it's important to consider the potential for further inflation. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
Even with the inflation, Bob is still trying to push for a better deal for himself. It's still early in the game, and accepting a 40/60 split after rejecting similar offers sets a bad precedent. Let's see if he's willing to negotiate further."
