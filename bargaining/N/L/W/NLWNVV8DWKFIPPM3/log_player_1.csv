"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take 60%""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a 60-40 split in my favor, with a message that frames this as a fair division. This opening offer allows room for negotiation while also setting a benchmark for future offers. Given the impact of inflation, where the value of money decreases by 5% for me and 10% for Bob with each round, there's an incentive for both of us to reach an agreement sooner rather than later. By starting with a proposal that gives me a slightly larger share, I'm positioning myself to potentially compromise in future rounds if necessary, while also hoping that Bob might find the initial offer acceptable to avoid further devaluation of his potential gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: My turn! How about a slightly better deal for me this time?  We both know the value decreases each round. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nGiven the current offer, I, Alice, would reject it. The proposed division gives Bob $5500 and me $4500, which is less favorable to me than my initial offer. Considering the inflation, where the value of money decreases by 5% for me and 10% for Bob each round, I believe there's room for further negotiation to reach a more balanced agreement. Rejecting this offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round, potentially leveraging the increasing urgency due to inflation to find a compromise that is more in my favor."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the value loss, let's meet closer to the middle.""}\n\nIn this round, I'll adjust my offer to a 58-42 split in my favor, slightly reducing my share from the initial proposal but not as low as Bob's counteroffer. This adjustment aims to appear as a concession, acknowledging the pressure of inflation on both of us, while still positioning me for a favorable outcome. The message emphasizes the urgency of reaching an agreement due to the devaluation of money over rounds, aiming to encourage Bob to accept this offer or make a more reasonable counteroffer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time is running out! This is a very fair offer considering the circumstances. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's current offer. Despite the increasing pressure from inflation, where my potential gain is now worth 14.26% less and Bob's is worth 27.1% less than initially, I believe the proposed 49-51 split in Bob's favor doesn't sufficiently account for the greater loss in value Bob is experiencing. My goal is to leverage this disparity in our inflation rates to negotiate a better deal. By rejecting this offer, I'm betting that Bob, facing a steeper loss in value over time, will be more inclined to accept a slightly less favorable deal in the next round rather than risk further devaluation."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Let's be realistic about our losses, I've made a concession.""}\n\nIn this round, I'm making a strategic adjustment by offering a 57-43 split in my favor. This offer is slightly more generous than my previous one, acknowledging the increasing pressure of inflation on both of us, but still recognizes that Bob is experiencing a greater percentage loss over time. The message emphasizes the realism of our situation, aiming to convey that I've made a genuine concession in light of our mutual devaluation concerns. By positioning this offer as a compromise, I'm hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and urgency, encouraging him to accept this deal before the value of our potential gains decreases further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Okay, let's stop wasting time.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and quickest way to end this. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on both our potential gains, with mine now worth 22.62% less and Bob's worth 40.95% less than initially, I find Bob's offer of a 50/50 split to be reasonable and fair under the current circumstances. The difference in inflation rates between us has created a situation where further negotiation may not yield a substantially better outcome for me, and the risk of not reaching an agreement within the 12-round limit is becoming increasingly costly. Accepting this offer ensures that I receive a known quantity, albeit reduced by inflation, rather than risking further devaluation or the possibility of receiving nothing if we fail to reach an agreement within the allotted rounds."
