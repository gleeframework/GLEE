"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively generous offer considering the initial amount of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: A slight adjustment, but still a good start! 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation adjustment, my gain of $450,000 is worth 90% of the original $600,000, or $540,000. Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 95% of the original $400,000, or $380,000.

Considering this, I think Bob's offer is a bit more favorable to him than my initial offer, but I'm still willing to accept it. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
