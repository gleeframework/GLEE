Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm still waiting for a good deal 
# Bob gain: 300000 
# Alice gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

At this point, taking Alice's offer is the best course of action. Here's why:

* **Severe Inflation:** The value of Bob's potential gain has eroded significantly due to inflation. Accepting $300,000 now is better than risking an even lower amount in subsequent rounds.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice is clearly holding out for a highly favorable deal. It's unlikely she'll offer anything significantly better in the remaining rounds.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Even if Bob could secure a slightly better deal later, the continued inflation makes a quicker, albeit smaller, gain more attractive."
