"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4000,
  ""bob_gain"": 6000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 40-60 and call it a day""
}
```

I'm offering to take 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and leaving $6,000 for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fairer split. Let's avoid any more rounds. 
# Alice gain: 3500 
# Bob gain: 6500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $3,500 is worth 80% of the original $4,000, which is $2,800.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting the offer because I think I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation, the money is worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%), so my gain of $2,800 is worth $1,792.

Here's my new proposal:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 3000,
  ""bob_gain"": 7000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, Bob""
}
```"
