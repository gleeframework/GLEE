"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, I'll take the lion's share""}

I'm proposing that I get 700,000 and Bob gets 300,000. I think this is a fair starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not happy about the reduced value of my potential gain due to inflation, but I'm willing to consider Bob's offer.
