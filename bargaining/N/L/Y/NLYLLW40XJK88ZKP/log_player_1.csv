"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%. I think this is a fair starting point for our negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, I'll give you a slightly smaller share 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm looking for a better deal. I was hoping to get at least 50% of the initial $100, and Bob's offer is quite far from that. I'll wait for another chance to make a proposal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle, 50-50 split!""}

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more reasonable compromise. I'm willing to give up some of my initial demand to find a mutually beneficial agreement."
