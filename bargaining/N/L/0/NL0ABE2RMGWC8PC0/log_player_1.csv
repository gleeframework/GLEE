  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. What do you say?""

# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 9,000 (10,000 x 0.9).

I'm not sure I'm comfortable with a 50-50 split, especially since I was initially proposing a 60-40 split. I'd like to negotiate a bit more.
