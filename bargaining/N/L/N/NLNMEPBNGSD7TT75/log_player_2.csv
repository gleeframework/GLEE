Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bigger share. This is a 60/40 split, and it's the best I can offer.  If you reject, the value will keep decreasing, and we'll both end up with nothing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better, it's still heavily skewed in her favor.  The threat of inflation losing us both money is real, but I need to show I'm willing to walk away from a bad deal. A 60/40 split after two rounds isn't enough of a concession from her initial offer."
