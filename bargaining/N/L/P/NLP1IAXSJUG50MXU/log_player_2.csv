# Alice gain: 510000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is correct that we are both losing money, the rate at which her potential earnings decrease is far higher than mine. My offers have been reasonable and moving towards a more even split. Holding out a bit longer could push her to accept a deal where I receive a bit more."

# Bob gain: 495000 
# Alice gain: 505000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:** 

This is a tough call, but the risk of getting nothing is too great now. Alice is clearly getting desperate, and while the offer isn't ideal, it's better than walking away empty-handed after Round 12."
