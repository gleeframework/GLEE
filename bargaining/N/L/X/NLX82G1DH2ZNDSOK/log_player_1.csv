"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems like a fair and reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. Let's see if this works for you. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, the money is worth less, so I need to adjust my expectations accordingly.

I'll analyze the offer:

* My gain: 400,000, which is worth 95% of 500,000 (my previous offer), so I'm getting less than I initially proposed.
* Bob's gain: 600,000, which is worth 80% of 750,000 (the amount he would have gotten in the first round if he had accepted my initial offer).

Considering the inflation and the fact that Bob is still getting more than I am, I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

I'll reject this offer, as I think I can do better.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since I rejected Bob's offer, it's my turn again. I'll make a new offer, taking into account the 10% decrease in Bob's gain due to inflation.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I need a fair share too""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share than before, but still a decent amount. Let's see if he accepts this time!"
