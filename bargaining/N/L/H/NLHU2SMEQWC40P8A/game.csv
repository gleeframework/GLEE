,,,Bob,1,reject
4000.0,6000.0,"I appreciate your fairness, Alice, but I believe my position demands a larger share in the initial rounds. Let's see how this works out.",Bob,2,
,,"While I appreciate your initiative, Bob, this offer doesn't reflect the increasing pressure on your side as the rounds progress. Let's find a more balanced solution.",Alice,2,reject
6500.0,3500.0,"Bob, it seems we need to find a compromise.  This offer is slightly better for me than the last round, considering the inflation working against you.  Let's be reasonable and close this deal.",Alice,3,
,,,Bob,3,reject
3500.0,6500.0,"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise, but I'm still seeking a larger share in these early rounds. The inflation is a significant factor, and I need to ensure I get a fair return for my efforts.",Bob,4,
,,"Bob, your perception of fairness seems skewed by the initial rounds.  With each passing round, the value diminishes significantly for you.  Let's be realistic and aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",Alice,4,reject
7000.0,3000.0,"Bob, I'm increasing my share again to demonstrate the urgency. Your potential gain is rapidly decreasing with each refusal. Let's be pragmatic and finalize this before it's too late for both of us.",Alice,5,

,,"Bob, it's time for you to get serious.  Your offers are increasingly detached from reality.  This is bordering on absurd given the rapid devaluation of your share.  I urge you to reconsider your strategy before it's too late.",Alice,6,reject
7500.0,2500.0,"Bob, this is getting ridiculous.  You're letting pride and a poor understanding of the situation cost us both significant sums.  Accept this offer, and let's be done with this charade.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
2500.0,7500.0,"Alice, I understand your frustration, but I'm still not convinced this is the best solution. We both have to acknowledge the impact of inflation. I believe we can find a more equitable outcome that takes this factor into account. Let's keep negotiating.",Bob,8,
,,"Bob, are you delusional?  Your greed is astounding!  Wake up and smell the inflation!  Every round that passes sees your potential share shrink drastically, yet you cling to this fantasy of getting the larger portion.  Accept that things have changed, or we'll both end up with nothing!",Alice,8,reject
8000.0,2000.0,"Bob, this is your final warning.  The clock is ticking, and your stubbornness is leading us both to ruin.  Accept this generous offer, or prepare to walk away with absolutely nothing.  The choice is yours, but make it quickly!",Alice,9,

2000.0,8000.0,"Alice, I understand the pressure we're both facing, but I'm still holding out for a fairer split. We're both losing money with each passing round, and I believe we can still find a compromise that benefits both of us. Let's work together to find a solution before it's too late.",Bob,10,
,,"Bob, you've finally driven me to the brink of insanity.  While this offer is an insult to my intelligence, it's marginally better than getting nothing at all.  Consider this a harsh lesson in negotiation and the perils of unchecked greed.  I begrudgingly accept.",Alice,10,accept
