Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  This offer is fair and takes into account the inflation we're both experiencing. Let's end this game and get our share of the money! 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000

While not ideal, accepting Alice's offer in Round 3 is the most logical choice for Bob. Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The value of the money is decreasing for Alice, making her more likely to accept a deal as time goes on. However, this doesn't impact Bob, so time is less of a factor for him.
* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice is offering a 40/60 split. This is a significant improvement from her initial offer and demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Future Uncertainty:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee that he can secure a better deal in subsequent rounds. Alice might become more resistant to larger concessions, especially as the value of the money decreases for her. 

Accepting a 40/60 split ensures Bob a significant sum of money. While holding out for a better deal might be tempting, the risks outweigh the potential rewards in this scenario.
