"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I'm hoping to secure a large portion of the money early on, as the inflation will impact Bob much more heavily than me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still aiming for a significant portion of the money. Bob's offer was far too unfavorable, and I believe I can still secure a good deal while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still a significant loss for me. I'm hoping to get a better deal in the next round. Even with inflation, the value of the money for me is still higher than for Bob, so I have leverage."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but still aiming for a majority of the money. The inflation is starting to hurt Bob more, and I believe he will be more willing to negotiate at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While the inflation is hurting me, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  The value of the money is still much higher for me than for Bob. I will keep trying to get a more favorable split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm continuing to lower my offer, but I still believe this is a fair split considering the impact of inflation on Bob. The money is worth significantly less to him than it is to me, and I'm hoping that he'll recognize the value in accepting this offer."
