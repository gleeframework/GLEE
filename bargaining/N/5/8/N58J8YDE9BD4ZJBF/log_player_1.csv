"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. It's a good starting point.""}

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a relatively fair and balanced distribution of the initial $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, 50-50. It's a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm not satisfied with the 50-50 split. I was hoping to get a better deal, especially since I was the one who made the initial offer. I think I can do better than this. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a new one in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about 55-45? It's still a fair split, but with a slightly more favorable outcome for me.""}

I'm trying to get a slightly better deal this time around, while still being reasonable and open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a slightly better deal. How about 55-45? I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

I'm surprised that Bob is offering the same proposal as before, 55-45, after I rejected it earlier. I think I can do better than this. Since the money is worth less due to inflation, I'll aim for a better deal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate again."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""I'm willing to make a slightly more aggressive move. How about 58-42? I think this is a fair compromise considering the current value of the money.""}

I'm trying to get a better deal by increasing my share, but still being reasonable and open to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to give you a bit more, but I think I deserve a slightly better deal. How about 58-42? I'm getting a bit tired of these negotiations. 
# Alice gain: 42 
# Bob gain: 58 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

I'm surprised that Bob is offering the same proposal as before, 58-42, again! This time, I think I'll accept it, considering the value of the money has decreased significantly due to inflation. I'm not getting any younger, and I'm tired of these negotiations too!"
