"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it 55/45. While I recognize the value of money diminishes for you, I believe this is a fair compromise that still favors you in light of your diminishing returns. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
