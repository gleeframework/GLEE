"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair.  I propose a 60/40 split in my favor, as I'll be taking the bigger hit from inflation.  What do you think? 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll wait for a better offer! The current offer doesn't seem fair to me. I'd rather take my chances with inflation and see if I can get a better deal in the next round.\n\n### Please proceed to the next round. I'll make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","### {""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Let's try a 55/45 split in my favor. I think it's more fair considering the inflation rate is higher for me.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's try a 50/50 split.  Since inflation is hurting us both,  it seems like the fairest way to go. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","### {""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nA 50/50 split seems fair, especially considering the impact of inflation on both of us. I'd rather accept this offer than risk further devaluation of the money in subsequent rounds.\n\n### I'm satisfied with this offer, so I'll accept it and end the game here."
