I propose a 9000/1000 split in my favor. This is a strong opening offer, leaving a significant share for Bob. Let's see if he bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is a significant decrease from my previous proposal. Even with the inflation, I'm confident I can secure a better deal. I'll reject and hope to get a more favorable offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8500, ""bob_gain"": 1500}
```

I'm going to counter with an offer closer to my initial proposal, but still leaving Bob with a decent share.  I'm hoping this demonstrates flexibility and encourages him to accept before we lose more money to inflation."

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 8000 
# Bob gain: 2000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is tempting, but I'm still holding out for a better deal.  I've seen that even with inflation, I can get more.  I'll reject and see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8250, ""bob_gain"": 1750}
```

I'll try a slightly lower offer, but still aiming for a majority of the money.  I'm hoping Bob is starting to realize that the inflation is hurting him more than me, and that we're both losing out with every round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7500 
# Bob gain: 2500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a larger share, Bob's offer is starting to get more appealing.  The inflation is really hurting him now, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all. I'll accept this offer and secure a decent share of the money."
