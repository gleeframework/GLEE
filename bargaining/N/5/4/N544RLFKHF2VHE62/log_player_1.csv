"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a very slightly unfair offer. I think it's likely Bob will reject this and then I'll be able to propose a more even split in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

This offer is fair, so I'll accept."
