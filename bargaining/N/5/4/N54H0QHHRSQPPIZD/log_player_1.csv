"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you 10% and take the rest. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it evenly. We both get half. This is a fair start. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less, my gain would be $720,000, and Bob's gain would be $450,000.

I'm not sure if splitting it evenly is the best option, considering the inflation factor. I'd like to try to get a bit more.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more, considering the inflation. Your offer is a bit too generous.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation factor, the money is now worth 40% of its original value. I'll aim to get a bit more than half.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you 40% and take 60%. It's a fair compromise, considering the inflation.""
}
