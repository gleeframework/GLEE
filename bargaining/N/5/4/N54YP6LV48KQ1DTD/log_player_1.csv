Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I propose a 999,000/1,000 split. It seems fair to me, as I'm taking the majority of the money, but I am allowing Bob to receive a small share as well. Let's see what he thinks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer. While I am getting a substantial amount of money, Bob's offer is still much lower than my initial offer, and with the inflation affecting Bob more, I believe that I can still negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I propose a 750,000/250,000 split. This offer is still significantly more advantageous for me, but it's a compromise from my initial proposal, acknowledging that Bob's bargaining power has increased due to inflation. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept."
