"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm starting strong, let's see if you can do better!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which is a generous offer considering the initial amount of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Time to be fair, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $5000 in Round 2 is worth 90% of what it was in Round 1, which is $5400. And Bob's gain of $5000 is worth 80% of what it was in Round 1, which is $4000.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to meet in the middle just yet. I'd like to see if I can do better."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""You were too generous last round, I'll take a bit more this time!""
}
```

I'm increasing my gain slightly, while still leaving Bob with a significant share. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're pushing for more, I'll give you a bit less, but still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain of $4000 in Round 4 is worth 39.6% of what it was in Round 1, which is approximately $3960. And Bob's gain of $6000 is worth 52% of what it was in Round 1, which is approximately $5200.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept this offer. I think I can do better than a 40-60 split, especially considering the inflation."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4800,
  ""bob_gain"": 5200,
  ""message"": ""I'm not backing down, but I'll give you a bit more!""
}
```

I'm increasing Bob's share slightly, but still aiming to get a larger share for myself. Let's see if he'll accept this offer!"
