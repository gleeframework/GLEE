"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 900000,
  ""bob_gain"": 100000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. I'll give you $100,000 and keep $900,000. It's a good starting point, don't you think?""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $100,000 and keeping $900,000 for myself. This way, we both get a significant amount, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle, let's start with a 50/50 split. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for me, my gain is now 900,000 * 0.9 = 810,000.

I'll consider Bob's offer. A 50/50 split seems reasonable, but I'd like to get a bit more. However, I don't want to reject the offer and risk losing more money in subsequent rounds.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
