"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $1,000,000 and leave Bob with 40%. This seems like a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $240,000. Bob's gain of $700,000 is worth 140% of its original value, which is $980,000.

Considering the reduced value of my gain, I'm not too thrilled about this offer. However, it's still a decent proposal, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer in the next round. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
