"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
```

This is my first offer. I propose a 90/10 split in my favor, hoping to secure a deal early on while the inflation is minimal.  Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal, and with inflation already in effect, it's not worth accepting. I'll try to secure a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly, taking into account Bob's willingness to negotiate and the increasing impact of inflation. A 70/30 split seems like a fair compromise at this point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, the inflation is hitting hard now.  I still believe I can secure a more favorable deal, given that Bob keeps rejecting my proposals."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 650000, ""bob_gain"": 350000}
```

I'm adjusting my offer slightly again, aiming for a more balanced split.  With inflation accelerating, I need to secure a deal soon, but I won't settle for a completely unfair outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 520000 
# Bob gain: 480000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even though Bob's offer is closer to a 50/50 split, the inflation is making the money worth significantly less.  I need to push for a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm moving closer to a 50/50 split, but still holding onto a slight advantage.  Inflation is making the money worth less with each passing round, so I need to make progress towards a deal soon."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 52.17% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 79.03% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While inflation has eaten away a significant portion of the potential earnings, Bob's offer finally presents a 50/50 split.  It's time to secure this deal before inflation makes the remaining money even less valuable."
