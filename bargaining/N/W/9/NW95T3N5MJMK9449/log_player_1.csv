Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think 5500/4500 is a fairer split considering the inflation. Let's end this quickly and both walk away with a decent sum. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500
