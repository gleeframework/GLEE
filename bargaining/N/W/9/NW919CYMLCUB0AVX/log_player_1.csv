"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000
}
```

This is a generous offer, but I'm trying to maximize my gain while still leaving Bob with a decent amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I need to adjust my strategy. Since Bob's offer is now more favorable to him, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. I'll reject this offer.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be worth even less than in the previous rounds. Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

This time, I'm trying to get a slightly larger share to compensate for the reduced value of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 460000 
# Bob gain: 540000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings. Considering the reduced value of money, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Bob's offer seems reasonable, but I'll see if I can do better. I'll reject this offer.

{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","The value of money is continuing to drop. Here's my next offer:

```

I'm now aiming for a 50/50 split, hoping that Bob will accept this offer and we can end the game."
