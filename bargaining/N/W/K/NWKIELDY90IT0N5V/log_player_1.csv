"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can move on.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000 and keeping $9,000 for myself. This is a relatively fair starting offer, and I'm hoping Bob will accept to get the game started."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too greedy, let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll take a more moderate approach this time. Since the money is worth 5% less for me due to inflation, I'll accept Bob's offer. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```"
