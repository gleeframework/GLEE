"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly""}\n\n###\n\nI have proposed an offer where I, Alice, receive $6,000 and Bob receives $4,000, with a message suggesting a fair split. Please let me know Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split considering the inflation factor.  Let's agree and move on. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI, Alice, reject Bob's offer in Round 2. The offer gives me $4,000, which, considering the 20% decrease in value due to inflation, is actually worth less than its face value. Meanwhile, Bob gets $6,000 without any devaluation. I believe a more equitable distribution is possible, so I will reject this offer and proceed to the next round to make a counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, this is a more balanced split.""}\n\n###\n\nIn Round 3, considering the inflation factor that affects my share, I propose an offer where I receive $5,500, and Bob receives $4,500. The message highlights that this division takes into account the devaluation of my share due to inflation, aiming for a more balanced split between us. Please relay this offer to Bob."
