"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 70,
  ""bob_gain"": 30
}
```

This is a fairly generous offer, but I'm hoping to get a good chunk of the money upfront!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is still worth the same as in the first round, I'm not too concerned about inflation affecting me. However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'd like to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since Bob's offer was quite aggressive, I'm going to try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more favorable to me. I'll offer a slightly higher share for myself, but still leave some room for Bob to negotiate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50
}
```"
