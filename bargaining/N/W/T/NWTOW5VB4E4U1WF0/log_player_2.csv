Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be reasonable. I'm willing to split it more evenly this time, but we both need to be careful not to lose too much to inflation.  What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
