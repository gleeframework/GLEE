"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a fair split, Bob. Let's get this started! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer seems fair on the surface, Bob can likely secure a better deal in subsequent rounds. The threat of inflation incentivizes Alice to offer more favorable splits as the game progresses."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Let's make it simple and fair, Alice. 50/50.""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Fairness:** A 50/50 split is inherently fair and establishes a strong starting point for negotiations. 
* **Time Pressure:**  While Bob rejected Alice's initial offer, waiting too long is risky due to inflation.  This offer keeps things moving.
* **Sets a Tone:** A firm but fair offer signals that Bob is serious about getting an equitable deal."
