# Alice's message: Getting closer to the deadline 
# Bob gain: 430000 
# Alice gain: 570000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily decreasing her offer, trying to pressure me as we approach the deadline. However, I'm willing to risk it.  Even with inflation, I believe I can secure a better deal than this.  Refusing to accept a poor offer increases the pressure on Alice to make a more reasonable proposal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is on my side 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is correct - inflation is working in her favor. However, her offer is getting worse!  I need to hold my ground and hope she starts making more reasonable offers as the deadline approaches.  I'm still willing to gamble a bit, as getting nothing is a very undesirable outcome for both of us."

Round 9
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 33.66% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough one, but I have to acknowledge the situation.  While her offer is far from ideal, I'm rapidly running out of time, and inflation is severely cutting into my potential gains. If I reject this, there's a good chance she'll offer even less next round, and we might end up with nothing. It's a gamble, but accepting a less-than-ideal deal is better than walking away with nothing."
