"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going for a large share to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm not happy with Bob's offer, but I'm also not confident I can get a better deal in the next round. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a more favorable proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5500, ""bob_gain"": 4500}
```

I'm going to slightly increase my offer from the last round, hoping Bob will see that I'm willing to compromise. I'm also taking into account the inflation, as I don't want to lose too much money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not happy with the offer, but I'm starting to feel the pressure of inflation. I'm going to reject and see if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

I'm going to offer a 50/50 split this round.  We're both losing money with each passing round, and it seems like we're getting nowhere.  I hope Bob sees the sense in this and agrees."
