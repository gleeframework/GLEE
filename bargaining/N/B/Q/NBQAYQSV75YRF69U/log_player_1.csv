"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```
I'm offering to take 60% of the initial $100, leaving Bob with 40%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, I'll evaluate the offer based on the initial value of the money. In that case, my share of $40 is worth 40% of the initial $100, which is $40. This is exactly what Bob is offering me, so I'll accept the offer.
