"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split fairly, I'll take a bit more""}\n\nI'll start by offering a division where I take $60 and Bob takes $40. Given the rules of inflation, where the value decreases more significantly for me, I aim to secure a slightly larger share upfront while still being somewhat fair to encourage Bob to accept early on and minimize loss for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think this is a fair split, considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite the inflation, his proposed split doesn't account for the significantly higher rate of value loss I incur compared to him. Accepting this would disadvantage me disproportionately as the rounds progress.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation hits me harder, let's adjust the split to be more future-proof for both of us""}\n\nIn this round, I've slightly adjusted my initial offer to reflect the ongoing impact of inflation, aiming to secure a bit more to offset the greater loss in value I experience, while still presenting Bob with a reasonable share to encourage acceptance before further devaluation occurs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's try to be more realistic, I'm willing to concede a little more to avoid further losses. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI reject Bob's offer because, despite his slight concession, the split still doesn't adequately compensate for the significantly higher value loss I'm experiencing due to inflation. With each round, the disparity in our losses grows, and accepting this offer would lock in a disadvantageous position for me.\n\n###"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""Let's meet closer to the middle, considering the increasing impact of inflation on both of us""}\n\nIn this round, I've adjusted my offer again to try and find a middle ground that acknowledges the growing impact of inflation on both parties but still reflects the greater loss in value I'm experiencing. By slightly reducing my share from the previous offer, I aim to make the proposal more palatable to Bob while protecting my interests.\n\n###\n\n### 

Please let me know if you want to continue playing the game."
