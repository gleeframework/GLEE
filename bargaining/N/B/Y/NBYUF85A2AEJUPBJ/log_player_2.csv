Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You said that was your final offer, but I'm making another one 
# Bob gain: 380000 
# Alice gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Reasoning:

While not ideal, the effects of inflation are becoming too severe.  Accepting a smaller share now is better than risking even greater losses and potentially ending up with nothing."
