Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I propose to take $90 and give Bob $10.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get him to accept in the first round, before inflation kicks in!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 75 
# Bob gain: 25 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher cut, the inflation is really starting to hurt.  Accepting $75 is better than risking another round and potentially getting even less."
