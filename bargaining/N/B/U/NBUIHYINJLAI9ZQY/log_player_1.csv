{""alice_gain"": 500000, ""bob_gain"": 500000, ""message"": ""Fair and simple split!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split of the $1,000,000, with each of us getting $500,000."

# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the 400k offer, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll need to think carefully about this.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was a bit low, I'll try to make a counteroffer that's a bit more aggressive. Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""You can do better than that, Bob!""}

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, with me getting the larger share."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not giving in too much! 
# Alice gain: 480000 
# Bob gain: 520000 
Do you accept this offer?","Bob's offer is still not very generous, but I'll consider it. Since the money is worth 27.1% less for Bob, I'll need to adjust my expectations.

I'll accept this offer, but only because I think it's the best I can get at this point.
