"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

I'm going to start with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept it in the first round. Since the money is worth less to me in the next round, I want to secure as much as possible now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Although I'd prefer more, Bob's offer is fair and the money is worth less for me each round. Accepting now is the best option for me."
