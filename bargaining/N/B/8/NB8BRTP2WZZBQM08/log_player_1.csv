"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and give Bob 40 dollars. This is a relatively fair split, considering we're starting from a neutral position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","The stakes are getting lower due to inflation.

I'll consider Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I accept Bob's offer of a 50-50 split. It's a fair deal, and I'd rather settle for this than risk going to the next round with even lower-value money."
