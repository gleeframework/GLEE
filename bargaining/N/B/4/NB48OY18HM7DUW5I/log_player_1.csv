"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can finalize the deal.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems reasonable for the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a bigger share, but it's still a decent offer 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure I want to give up 80% of the remaining value.

I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further.

```

  ""decision"": ""reject""

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","In round 3, my gain is worth 5% less than in round 2, and the money is worth less overall. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle. This is a fair split considering the inflation.""
}
```

I'm trying to find a balance between getting a decent share and giving Bob a reasonable offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but it's still a reasonable offer considering the inflation 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the increased inflation, the value of the money is decreasing rapidly. I need to be more careful with my decisions. Bob's offer is still quite aggressive, but I'm not sure I can do better.

I'll accept this offer to avoid further losses.
