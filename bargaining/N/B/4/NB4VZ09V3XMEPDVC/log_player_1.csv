"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 80-20, it's a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 80-20 split, with me getting 800,000$ and Bob getting 200,000$. I think this is a reasonable starting point, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're giving me too much, I'll take 90% 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, that's a big difference!

After considering Bob's proposal, I decide to reject it. I'm not willing to give up 80% of the money, even if it's worth less due to inflation.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, 60-40, it's a fair compromise!""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to a 60-40 split, trying to find a middle ground. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70%, it's a fair deal, no need to negotiate 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of the money is decreasing fast!

I'm not thrilled about giving up 70% of the remaining value, but I'm starting to run out of options. I decide to accept Bob's offer, hoping that I can at least get something out of this.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
