"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, hoping to set a good tone for the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a fair deal 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this one. With inflation, my gain of $4000 is now worth only $3600 (since it's 10% less than the original $4000).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's a bit lopsided. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of my potential gains, I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly smaller share, but I need a bit more for myself""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly bigger share, but still a reasonable compromise 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger bite out of my potential gains, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. My gain of $4500 is now worth only $3285 (since it's 27.1% less than the original $4000).

I'm not sure if I want to accept this offer, as it's still a bit lopsided. I'd rather try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","I'll have to be more aggressive in my proposal, considering the increasing effect of inflation. Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm taking a firmer stance, but I'm still willing to compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's meet in the middle, we're getting closer! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","Whoa, inflation is really taking a toll on my potential gains! My gain of $5000 is now worth only $3000 (since it's 40.95% less than the original $4000).

Considering the significant loss in value due to inflation, I'm tempted to accept this offer. It's a 50-50 split, and it's better than getting a smaller share with even more value lost to inflation.
