"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 400k, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, I need to be careful about the value of the money.

My current proposal in the first round was 500,000, which is now worth 90% of its original value due to inflation (since it's 10% less). So, my current proposal would be 450,000.

Bob's offer is 400,000, which is 80% of my original proposal. I'm not sure if it's a good deal, but it's better than nothing.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is a bit low, I'll make a new proposal.""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 10% less due to inflation, my new proposal will be 10% less than my previous proposal.

In round 2, my proposal was 450,000, which is 10% less than 500,000. So, in round 3, I'll propose 405,000.

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 405000,
  ""bob_gain"": 595000,
  ""message"": ""Will you accept this slightly lower offer?""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still not convinced 
# Alice gain: 380000 
# Bob gain: 620000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my original proposal of 500,000 is now worth 72.9% of its original value (since it's 27.1% less). So, my current proposal would be around 364.5k (500k x 0.729).

Bob's offer of 380,000 is slightly higher than my adjusted proposal, but still a bit lower. Considering the inflation effect, I'll have to decide whether to accept this offer.

I'll reject this offer and make a new proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Your offer is close, but I'll try to get a bit more.""
}
```"

In round 4, my proposal was 405,000, which is 27.1% less than 500,000. So, in round 5, I'll propose 295,000.

Here's my new offer:

  ""bob_gain"": 705000,

# Bob's message: I'll give you a bit more, but I'm still trying to get a better deal
