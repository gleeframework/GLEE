**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With each round, the value of the money decreases significantly for both players. It's becoming increasingly risky to hold out for a better offer.
* **Bob's Movement:** Bob has shown willingness to negotiate, moving closer to a more even split. This suggests he understands the impact of inflation on both sides. 
* **Acceptable Loss:** While not ideal, accepting this offer ensures Alice receives a reasonable sum, even after considering the inflation. Rejecting it risks a worse outcome in later rounds as the money continues to lose value."
