"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money almost equally. I've taken a bit more since I made the offer.""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering a division of $6,000 for myself and $4,000 for Bob. I've attached a message explaining my reasoning for this division, emphasizing the fairness of the split while also acknowledging that I've taken a slightly larger share for making the offer. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe my contribution to our success deserves a larger share. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI've decided to reject Bob's offer. Given that the money I gain is now worth 10% less due to inflation, I believe accepting $4,500 would be the equivalent of accepting an even lower amount than initially proposed. I also disagree with Bob's assertion that his contribution deserves a larger share, especially considering the impact of inflation on my potential gain. It's time for me to make a counteroffer that takes these factors into account."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I've adjusted my offer. I believe this is a more reasonable split, given the circumstances.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I've decided to offer a division of $5,800 for myself and $4,200 for Bob. I've taken into account the 10% decrease in value for my share due to inflation and adjusted my offer accordingly. My message to Bob explains this reasoning, emphasizing that I believe this is a more reasonable split under the current circumstances. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: The value of this deal diminishes with each round that passes. I'm offering a slightly more equitable split, but this is my final offer. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value of my potential gain due to inflation (now 27.1% less than in the first round), and Bob's message indicating that this is his final offer, I've decided to accept his proposal. While the split isn't perfectly equal, the diminishing value of the money with each passing round makes it prudent to accept this offer rather than risking further devaluation. It seems like the best option under the current circumstances."
