"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You're running out of time, be reasonable 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly trying to exploit the inflation disadvantage Bob faces. While the offers are getting closer to an even split, Bob can still hold out for a better deal. The rate of inflation is high, but there are still rounds left to apply pressure and make Alice consider a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Okay, Alice, let's stop wasting time. 50/50, take it or leave it.  We both lose if this goes on.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Your 50/50 was close, but not quite there 
# Bob gain: 4100 
# Alice gain: 5900 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

**Reasoning:**

The situation is getting critical. While 4100 is much lower than Bob would have liked, rejecting this offer means risking getting even less in subsequent rounds due to the rapid inflation. Alice is clearly unwilling to accept a 50/50 split, and time is running out. It's better to take a less-than-ideal offer now than risk getting nothing at all if the game goes to the final round."
