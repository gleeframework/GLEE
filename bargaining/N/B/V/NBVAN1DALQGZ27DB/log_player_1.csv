"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll try to get a better deal! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 10% less for Bob, I'll have to reassess the offer. The effective gain for Bob is 54 (60 - 10% of 60), and the gain for me is still 40.

I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better deal for myself.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is still worth the same for me, but worth 10% less for Bob, I'll try to take advantage of this and make a slightly more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You can't win them all, Bob!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more favorable to me. Let's see if Bob will accept or reject this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting greedy, Alice! Time to give back! 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","The money is worth 27.1% less for Bob, so the effective gain for him is 39.27 (55 - 27.1% of 55). The gain for me is still 45.

I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's a more favorable deal for me compared to the previous offers.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
