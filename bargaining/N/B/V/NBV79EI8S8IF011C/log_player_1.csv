"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this generous offer and we can split the remaining funds in future rounds!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a 40% share, and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is a 60% share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm proposing a more equitable split.  Let's move forward with this. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation.

Since the money is worth 5% less in Round 2, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: $400,000 * 0.95 = $380,000
Bob's gain: $600,000 * 0.95 = $570,000

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Since the money is worth 5% less again, I'll calculate the actual amounts:

My gain: $380,000 * 0.95 = $361,000
Bob's gain: $570,000 * 0.95 = $541,500

Considering the reduced value of money, I'll make a new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""A slightly more generous offer from me. Don't pass it up!""
}
```"
