"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a bold move. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm offering Bob a relatively small share, but I'm hoping he'll accept to get something rather than risking a worse deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully before accepting or rejecting this offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for me now, I'll consider the actual amount I'll be getting in terms of real value.

If I accept this offer, I'll get $6000, which is equivalent to $4800 in the first round. That's a decent share, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer for now and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","With the inflation taking its toll, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small share, hoping he'll accept to avoid a worse deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 7000 
# Bob gain: 3000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential earnings! Given the significant decrease in value, I'll have to be more cautious and think carefully about accepting or rejecting this offer.

In real terms, the $7000 I'd get is equivalent to $6400 in the first round, and the $3000 Bob would get is equivalent to $2800 in the first round. It's a decent split, but I'm not sure if it's the best I can get.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal.

```
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","The inflation is really eating away at my potential earnings. I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer to account for the reduced value of the money. Here's my proposal:

```
{""alice_gain"": 9500, ""bob_gain"": 500}
```

I'm offering Bob a very small share, hoping he'll accept to avoid a worse deal in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6500 
# Bob gain: 3500 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking its toll on my potential earnings! Given the significant decrease in value, I'll have to be careful and think carefully about accepting or rejecting this offer.

In real terms, the $6500 I'd get is equivalent to $4000 in the first round, and the $3500 Bob would get is equivalent to $2800 in the first round. It's a relatively balanced split, and I'm not sure if I can do better.

I'll accept this offer, as I don't want to risk getting a worse deal in future rounds.
