Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Small concession, let's wrap this up 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly feeling the pressure of the inflation and is making concessions.  While Bob's gains are static, hers are diminishing significantly. Holding out for another round or two is likely to push her towards a more favorable split for Bob."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Time is running out.  A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient way to reach an agreement.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's getting risky. While Alice's offers are getting more appealing, there's a real danger of reaching the final rounds and getting nothing.  A 50/50 split might seem generous now, but it guarantees a reasonable payout and avoids the risk of walking away with nothing."
