"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn to decide!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a relatively generous offer, considering the total amount is $1,000,000. Now it's Bob's turn to decide!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'd like to propose a more even split. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain of $450,000 is worth 10% less than the $600,000 I would have gotten in the first round, which is $540,000. Bob's gain of $550,000 is worth 5% less than the $400,000 he would have gotten in the first round, which is $380,000.

Considering this, my response is:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""Not bad, but I was hoping for a more significant increase from the initial offer. Your turn again!""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation effect, the money is worth even less now. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more. Your turn to decide!""
}
```"
