"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 85,
""bob_gain"": 15,
""message"": ""Let's be reasonable. This offer still gives you something.""
}
```

I'm starting with a slightly aggressive offer to take advantage of the inflation working against me. Bob knows that if he waits too long, the value of the money will decrease significantly for me, making me more likely to accept a worse offer in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I won't accept such a low offer. This is much more reasonable. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I am under pressure from the inflation, accepting such a small share would be a mistake. I'm hoping he'll become more reasonable in the next round when I have the opportunity to make a counter-offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,
""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but this needs to be a fair deal for both of us. ""
}
```

My offer in round 1 was too aggressive, and Bob's counter-offer was too low.  This offer is a significant move towards the middle ground, reflecting my willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a larger share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer, Alice. You need to be realistic about the inflation working against you. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

This is a tough one. Bob is correct that inflation is working against me, and this offer is better than what I'll likely get if I continue to reject his proposals. However, it's still not an equal split, and I believe I have some leverage to push for a bit more. I'll take my chances and hope he's bluffing about this being his final offer."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be practical. I'm losing money with every round, but I'm still aiming for a fair deal. This is my final offer.""
}
```

I need to convey a sense of urgency due to the inflation. By stating this is my final offer, I'm hoping Bob will recognize that it's in his best interest to accept a deal now rather than risk me accepting a less favorable offer later due to the diminishing value."
