"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json

This is a fairly aggressive offer, but I'm hoping to secure a large share of the money early on before inflation significantly impacts Bob's gains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Even though the offer is less than my previous offer, it's still a better outcome for me. In round 1, Bob rejected my offer and now, due to inflation, the value of the money he gains is significantly less. It's in my best interest to accept this offer before the inflation further diminishes the value of my potential earnings."
