"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $1,000, which is 10% of the original amount. This way, I get the majority of the money, but still leave some for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me halfway, let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $5000 is now worth 90% of the original $5000, which is $4500.

I'm not thrilled about meeting Bob halfway, but I don't want to risk going into further rounds with decreasing values. I'll accept his offer.
