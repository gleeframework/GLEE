"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```

This is a fair and equal split, but I'm hoping Bob might be willing to accept a slightly lower amount for himself to see if he can get more in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to take a larger share for himself. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 2.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since Bob's offer in Round 2 was 60/40, I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```

This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","It looks like Bob is trying to get closer to his desired 60/40 split again. I'll have to decide whether to accept or reject this offer.

I'll reject Bob's offer from Round 4.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll try to negotiate a better deal for myself again. Since Bob's offers have been getting closer to his desired 60/40 split, I'll try to push back a bit. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5200,
  ""bob_gain"": 4800
}
```

This is a slightly more favorable split for me, but still a reasonable compromise."
