"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start, hoping Bob will accept and we can avoid any potential conflict."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 4000, but I think I deserve a bit more 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to think carefully about this offer, considering the effect of inflation on my potential gain.

Since the money I gain is worth 5% less due to inflation, $4000 is actually equivalent to $3800 in the original amount. And Bob's gain of $6000 is equivalent to $6000 in the original amount, which is a 60% share.

I'm not sure if I'm getting a good deal, but I don't want to reject the offer and risk getting an even worse deal in the next round. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
