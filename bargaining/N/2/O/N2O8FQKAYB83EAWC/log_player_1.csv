  ""alice_gain"": 50,

```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to start the game."

# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

I'll reject the offer for now. I'd like to try to get a better deal.

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Considering the decreasing value of the money, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""You're getting less, but I'm willing to give you a smaller share this round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, but I'm still leaving Bob with a significant share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you most of it, but I think I can do better next round 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on the value of the money. I'll have to be more cautious with my decisions.

However, Bob's offer is still a significant improvement from my previous offer, and the money is worth less for both of us. I'll consider it.
