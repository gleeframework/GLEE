"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose a 55/45 split in my favor. While I acknowledge the diminishing value of money, I believe this split is fair given the dynamic of the game. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{
