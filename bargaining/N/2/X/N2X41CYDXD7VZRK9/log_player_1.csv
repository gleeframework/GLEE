Bob's offer is getting better, but I'm still in a strong negotiating position. Inflation is hurting me, but I'm not desperate enough to accept a 30/70 split just yet. I'll continue to push for a fairer deal."

{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Inflation is hitting hard, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer a more even split, Bob's offer of 40/60 is the best I'm likely to get at this point. It's time to accept and avoid getting nothing at all."
