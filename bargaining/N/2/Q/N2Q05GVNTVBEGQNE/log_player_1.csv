"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet in the middle and split the money 50-50. It's a fair compromise, and we can both benefit from it. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
