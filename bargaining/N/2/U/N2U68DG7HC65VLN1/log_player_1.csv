"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}

I propose a 90/10 split in my favor. I figure this is a fair starting point, as I'll be losing more value with each passing round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
This offer is significantly worse than my initial proposal. While I am losing value with each round, so is Bob, but at a faster rate.  I will reject and see what he offers in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor. Bob's previous offer was unacceptable, and while I'm losing value with each round, it's still a significant loss for him, as he's losing value at twice the rate. I believe this offer is fair considering our relative losses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While the offer is not ideal, Bob's offer is better than my previous offer considering the inflation rates. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, and Bob's losses are far greater than mine at this point."
