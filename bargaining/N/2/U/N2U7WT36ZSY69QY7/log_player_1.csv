"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here is my offer for Round 1:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000
}
```
I'm proposing a 50-50 split to start."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation effect, my gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. Bob's gain is worth 20% less than in the first round, but still more than mine.

I'll reject Bob's offer. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Since the money is worth 10% less than in the first round due to inflation, I'll aim for a slightly higher share. Here's my offer for Round 3:
```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is catching up!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, Bob's offer is actually a decent one. I'll think carefully... I'd rather not risk going to Round 5, so I'll accept this offer.
