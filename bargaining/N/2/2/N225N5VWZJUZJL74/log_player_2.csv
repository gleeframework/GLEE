Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""My turn. Let's be fair, a 50/50 split seems reasonable.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you want to be fair, but the value decreases for me each round. This is a compromise.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we need to settle this soon. This offer benefits us both given the time pressure. 
# Bob gain: 4500 
# Alice gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting increasingly desperate, which means time is working in my favor. While her offers are getting closer to a more even split, I'm going to keep pushing my luck a little longer.  It's still early in the game."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5200, ""alice_gain"": 4800, ""message"": ""Alice, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and this is a fair offer considering the circumstances.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 46.86% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer. Take it or leave it. I'm getting less with each round, but this is still fair to you. 
# Bob gain: 4700 
# Alice gain: 5300 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly getting very anxious, calling this her ""final offer.""  While I need to be wary of pushing too far, there's still a decent amount of time left. The inflation heavily favors me, so I'm willing to risk another rejection to see if I can get an even better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 7.
Round 8
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5400, ""alice_gain"": 4600, ""message"": ""Alice, you said it yourself - time is running out. This is my last offer, take it or leave it.""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Applying pressure:** By mirroring Alice's ""final offer"" language, I'm increasing the pressure. 
* **Strategic concession:** I'm conceding slightly from my previous offer, making it seem like a difficult decision for me and a potential loss if she rejects.
* **Inflation advantage:** Time is still heavily in my favor. Even if she rejects this round, her position will be significantly weaker in the next."
