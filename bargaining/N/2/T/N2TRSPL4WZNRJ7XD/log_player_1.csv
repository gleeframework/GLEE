"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 900000, ""bob_gain"": 100000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a fairly generous offer to Bob, hoping to get the game over quickly.  I'll take 90% and leave 10% for him. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is much worse for me, even with inflation. I'm not going to accept such a drastic change in the distribution.  I'll counter in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000} 
```

I'm going to try to find a compromise.  I'll offer Bob 30% and keep 70% for myself.  I'm hoping this will be more appealing to him.  Since we both lost some value due to inflation, I'm willing to give up a little more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I still can't accept Bob's offer. While my money is worth less, I'm still not comfortable taking such a small percentage. I'll counter with my own proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000} 
```

I'm going to try one more time to reach an agreement. I'll offer Bob 40% and keep 60% for myself. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm hoping Bob will see that we're both losing value with each passing round and this is the fairest way to split the remaining money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  Even though the value of my share has dropped significantly due to inflation,  I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  It's time to end this game!"
