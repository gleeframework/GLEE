Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair, Alice. I'll take the lion's share, but you get a decent chunk as well.  Accept this and we both get a good amount before inflation eats away at our gains. 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
