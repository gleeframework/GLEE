"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's get this started! Take it or leave it!""
}
```

This means I'm offering Bob $200,000 and keeping $800,000 for myself. The message is just a bit of friendly trash talk to get the game going!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering the loss of value with each round, I propose we split the remaining amount evenly. 
# Alice gain: 550000 
# Bob gain: 450000 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 0% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I need to take this into account when evaluating the offer.

Let's calculate the actual values:

My gain: 550,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: 450,000 x 0.9 (10% less) = 405,000

Considering the values, I'll decide to reject this offer since I can get a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting closer, but I'm still the one with the upper hand!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob $300,000 and keeping $700,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a jab to keep the game interesting!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I believe we should continue to seek a fair division. My proposal aims to maintain a reasonable balance considering the decreasing value of our currency. 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual values considering the inflation:

My gain: 600,000 (no change)
Bob's gain: 400,000 x 0.727 (27.1% less) = 291.8 (round to 292,000)

Since my gain is still $600,000 and Bob's gain is $292,000, I'll decide to reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 750000,
  ""bob_gain"": 250000,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, Bob! Don't get left with nothing!""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob $250,000 and keeping $750,000 for myself. The message is a bit of a warning to Bob that he's getting close to the end of the game!"
