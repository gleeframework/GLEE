"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's be fair, I'll take a bit more""}\n\n###\n\nI'll start by offering Bob $40, which is a relatively generous offer considering I could try to take more. The message is an attempt to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make him consider accepting the offer early on. Since the value of money decreases with each round, I want to create an incentive for Bob to accept the offer sooner rather than later. By framing my offer as ""fair,"" I'm trying to create a psychological effect where Bob feels that rejecting the offer would be unreasonable. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your share loses value quickly, let's make a deal.  This is a better offer than you'll get in later rounds. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer because, despite the decreasing value of the money for me, I believe I can negotiate a better deal in the next rounds. Bob's message tries to create a sense of urgency, but I'm not convinced that this is the best offer I'll get. Since Bob's gain is worth only 5% less with each round, they have more to lose from further negotiations than I do. By rejecting this offer, I'm putting pressure on Bob to make an even better proposal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 58, ""bob_gain"": 42, ""message"": ""You're right, time is money. But I'm not desperate yet.""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer than in the first round, while still leaving room for negotiation. My message acknowledges Bob's point about the value of time, but also signals that I'm not feeling pressured to accept a suboptimal deal. By making a slightly higher offer than before, I'm testing Bob's willingness to compromise and trying to gauge their level of patience. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is a fair offer considering the inflation. Let's settle this now before our shares shrink even more. 
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'm rejecting Bob's offer again because, although the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, I believe I can still negotiate a better deal. Bob's message tries to emphasize the fairness of the offer, but I'm not convinced that this is the best I can get. Since Bob's gain is still worth relatively more than mine, I think they have more room to compromise. Additionally, I want to see how Bob reacts to further pressure and if they'll be willing to make an even more favorable offer in the next round. By rejecting this offer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 56, ""bob_gain"": 44, ""message"": ""I'm willing to take the risk, are you?""}\n\n###\n\nIn this round, I'm making a slightly more aggressive offer than before, while still leaving some room for negotiation. My message is a challenge to Bob, implying that I'm willing to take the risk of further inflation to get a better deal, and asking if they're willing to do the same. By making this offer, I'm trying to gauge Bob's level of risk aversion and see if they'll be willing to compromise further to avoid the uncertainty of future rounds. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer.  A 50/50 split is the fairest I'm willing to go.  Take it or leave it, because I won't budge any further. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nI'm accepting Bob's offer because, given the significant decrease in value of the money for me, a 50/50 split is a relatively good deal at this point. Bob's message is clear that this is their final offer, and I don't think I can negotiate a better deal. Since the value of the money is decreasing rapidly for me, it's better to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in future rounds. By accepting this offer, I'm securing a certain amount of money, even if it's worth less than it was initially. It's time to settle and get what I can!"
