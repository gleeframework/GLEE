# Alice's message: I'm feeling generous!  Let's split it 90/10, you get the smaller share this time. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 5% less in each subsequent round, I'll try to negotiate a better deal. Let's see what happens next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that's more reasonable than Alice's initial proposal. Since the money is worth 5% less in each round, I'll take that into account. Here's my offer:
{""bob_gain"": 4500, ""alice_gain"": 5500, ""message"": ""Let's split it fairly, considering the inflation!""}\n\n###\n\nYour turn, Alice!"
