"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000, which is a 40% share of the initial $10,000. I'm keeping $6,000 for myself, which is a 60% share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split it evenly.  What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain of $6,000 is now worth $5,700.

I'll consider Bob's offer. Splitting it evenly at $5,000 each is a good compromise, but I was hoping to get a bit more. However, I don't want to risk going into the next round with a smaller share. Let's accept this offer.
