"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and split the money 60-40. It's a good deal!""}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be practical, Alice. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nIt seems that Bob is trying to make a fair offer, but since the money is worth 20% less in this round, a 50/50 split would actually be less beneficial to me than my initial 60/40 proposal. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the result of my decision and Bob's next offer. I'll be happy to continue the game!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","###\n\nSince the money is worth 20% less in each round, I need to adjust my proposal to account for the decreasing value. I'll make a slightly more generous offer to Bob to try to reach an agreement before the money loses even more value.\n\n###\n\n{""alice_gain"": 5700, ""bob_gain"": 4300, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. Let's settle on 57-43 and call it a day!""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know Bob's response to my offer. I'm eager to see if we can come to an agreement in this round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Take this 52/48 split before inflation makes this whole thing pointless. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nAt this point, considering the significant decrease in value due to inflation, Bob's offer of a 52/48 split seems more reasonable than continuing to negotiate further. The difference in our gains is relatively small, and further rounds will only continue to decrease the value of the money.\n\n###\n\nGiven these circumstances, accepting Bob's offer seems like the most practical decision to make the most out of the current situation.\n\n###\n\n{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know the outcome of the game based on my decision. I'm looking forward to concluding this game of negotiation with Bob!"
