"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 8000,
  ""bob_gain"": 2000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game early.""
}
```

This offer gives me $8,000 and Bob $2,000, which is a 80-20 split. I'm hoping Bob will accept this reasonable offer and we can end the game quickly."
