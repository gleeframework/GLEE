Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100.","Since the money is worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Alice, I'll aim for a higher share. Here's my offer:

{""bob_gain"": 70, ""alice_gain"": 30}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth less for me now, I'll think about it... But 50-50 seems fair, considering the decreasing value of money. I'll accept this offer.
