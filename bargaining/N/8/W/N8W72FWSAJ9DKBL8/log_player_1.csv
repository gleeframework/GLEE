"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50}
``` 
Let's start with a fair split.  I'll take 50 and Bob can have 50."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm not happy with this offer.  It seems Bob is trying to take advantage of the inflation.  I'll make a counter-offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 53, ""bob_gain"": 47}
```

I'll offer Bob a slightly lower amount, but still close to an even split.  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 48 
# Bob gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is still too far off from a fair split. I'll continue to try for a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 51, ""bob_gain"": 49}
```

I'll offer a slight concession to try and reach an agreement.  Since the value of the money is decreasing, it's important to find a compromise.  I believe this offer is fair considering the circumstances."
