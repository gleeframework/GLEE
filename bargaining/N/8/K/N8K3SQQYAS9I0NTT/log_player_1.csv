"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, I'll give you a good deal!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $4,000 and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm starting with a relatively fair split, hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch roles, I'll give you a good deal! 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll have to be more careful with the inflation in mind. Since the money is worth 5% less for me, I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

I'll reject Bob's offer because I'm not getting a good enough deal considering the reduced value of money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll make a new offer that takes into account the reduced value of money. Since the money is worth 10% less in total (5% less for me and 5% less for Bob), I'll aim to keep a higher share to compensate.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a smaller share, but it's still a good deal!""
}
