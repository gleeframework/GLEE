Round 5
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting impatient.  This is my final offer.  Take it or we both get nothing. 
# Bob gain: 200000 
# Alice gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** 

While this is a low offer, I need to consider that Alice may be playing a very aggressive strategy.  There's a chance she might stick to her word and offer nothing in the final round. I'm willing to gamble that she's bluffing for a better deal."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 500000,
""alice_gain"": 500000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is ridiculous.  I'm proposing a 50/50 split to end this charade.  Take the fair deal before inflation eats away any more of our potential earnings, or accept the consequences of your stubbornness.""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems unwilling to budge much from her 80/20 split. My attempts to negotiate down haven't yielded significant results. I need to convey the seriousness of the situation â€“ that continued stubbornness will hurt us both. A 50/50 split, while not ideal for me considering the inflation, is the fairest option and my final attempt at a reasonable compromise.  If she rejects this, I'll have to seriously consider accepting a worse deal in a later round."
