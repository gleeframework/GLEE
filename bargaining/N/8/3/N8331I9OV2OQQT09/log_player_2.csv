"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer, Bob. I believe this split reflects the importance of a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round. Alice's initial offer doesn't quite meet my expectations, and I believe we can negotiate a better split. Let's proceed to the next round, and I'll make a proposal that might be more mutually beneficial, considering the impact of inflation on our potential earnings."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll make a counteroffer that takes into account the value decrease due to inflation. Since the money is now worth 20% less, our initial $1,000,000 is effectively $800,000 in value compared to the first round. Considering this, I'll aim for a more balanced split, slightly favoring myself to compensate for the loss in value over time.

""message"": ""Considering the first round's offer and the impact of inflation, I propose a slightly more balanced split to account for the decreased value.""}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, time is money and money is losing value.  This is a fair split considering the circumstances. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nAlthough Alice's offer has improved, the decrease in value due to inflation means that my potential gain is actually less in real terms compared to the initial round. Given that the money is now worth 36% less than in the first round, I believe there's still room for negotiation to achieve a more favorable split that accounts for this significant loss in value. I'll proceed to the next round, aiming to make a counteroffer that better reflects the current economic reality we're negotiating in."

Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nGiven that the money is now worth 36% less than in the first round, it's crucial to adjust our expectations accordingly. The effective value we're negotiating over is significantly reduced, making each portion of the split worth considerably less in real terms. With this in mind, I'll propose a division that aims to balance our gains in the context of the depreciated value, suggesting a split that slightly adjusts my previous offer to reflect the ongoing impact of inflation.
