Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your generosity in the first round, but I think we can both do better. I'm proposing a slightly reversed split, with me taking 60 and you taking 40. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
