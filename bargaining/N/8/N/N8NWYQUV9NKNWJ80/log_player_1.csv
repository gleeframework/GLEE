"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer. With the 20% inflation, the effective amount I'd gain is $320,000. Considering Bob's offer, I'd be getting $400,000, which is more than I'd get in the next round.

I'll accept this offer.
