I'll lower my share a bit, but I'm still hoping to get the majority.  Bob seems determined to take the lion's share, but I'm hoping to end the game before inflation eats away too much of my potential gains."

Bob is getting more and more aggressive, but I won't settle for such a small share. I'm willing to risk another round."

Inflation is hitting hard, and Bob is clearly taking advantage. I'm not happy with this outcome, but it's better than getting almost nothing in the next round."
