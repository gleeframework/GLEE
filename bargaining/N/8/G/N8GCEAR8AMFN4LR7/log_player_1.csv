"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 9000,
  ""bob_gain"": 1000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share. I'll give you $1000, and I'll get the rest.""
}
```

This way, I'm offering Bob a small amount to get the ball rolling, and I'll keep the majority of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking its toll, the money is worth less now.

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not satisfied with the offer, and I think I can do better. I'll wait for a new proposal from Bob."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve a bit more. How about we split it down the middle?""
}
```

This time, I'm offering Bob a smaller share, but I'm still trying to be reasonable and split the money fairly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly bigger share, but I still think I deserve more, and I'm willing to give you a bit more than you asked for 
# Alice gain: 6800 
# Bob gain: 3200 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking its toll, and the money is worth less and less with each round.

I'll consider Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I think this offer is a good compromise, and I'm willing to accept it. The money is worth less, but I'm getting a decent share, and I don't want to risk waiting for another round."
