"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, 60-40. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 65-35 split is fairer, considering the inflation will affect us both. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, I'm not sure if I want to accept a 65-35 split. I'd rather try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a split that's even more skewed towards Bob's favor, especially considering the inflation is affecting me more severely. I'll try to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation effect, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer to try to get a better deal.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think 50-50 is the most fair considering the inflation. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which I think is a more equitable distribution considering the inflation effect."
