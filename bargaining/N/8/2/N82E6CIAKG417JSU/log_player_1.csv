I propose Alice gets $900,000 and Bob gets $100,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 850000, ""bob_gain"": 150000}
``` 

I'm going to lower my share slightly to 850,000, and offer Bob 150,000.  This keeps the split in my favor, but recognizes that we're both losing money with each round."

I'm still holding out for a better deal, even with the inflation.  The value of the money is dropping significantly, but I'm hoping we can find a better split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}

I'm continuing to lower my share, but I still need to secure a majority to make this worthwhile.  We're getting close to the end, and the value is plummeting.  Let's see if Bob will take this."
