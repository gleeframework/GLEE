"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer, giving Bob 10% of the money. This ensures a good chance of acceptance while still securing a significant portion of the money for myself. Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

While I would prefer more, it's better to accept this offer. The inflation means that my potential earnings in future rounds will be significantly reduced, and there's no guarantee that Bob will make a more generous offer. Accepting this 50/50 split is the most sensible choice in this situation."
