"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 60,
""bob_gain"": 40,

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's speed things up. This is my counter-offer. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

Bob's offer is worse for me than my initial proposal.  Since my buying power isn't decreasing, I'm in a stronger position to negotiate."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 55,
""bob_gain"": 45,
""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic. This deal saves us both time and gets us a decent amount.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal.  We're running out of time, and the pot is shrinking for me. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject"" 
}
``` 

This is the same offer Bob gave me last round, just disguised with a  ""fair deal"" message.  I'm not going to accept an offer that's worse than my previous proposal, especially since time is working in my favor.  Bob's buying power is decreasing rapidly."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 52,
""bob_gain"": 48,
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but we both lose if this fails. This is a small concession on my part, let's close the deal.""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 40.95% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous. A 50/50 split is the only fair option at this point. Take it before inflation eats away at my share even more. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept"" 
}
``` 

Bob is finally offering an even split. While I could push for more, there's a real risk he'll dig in his heels and refuse any further concessions. It's better to secure a guaranteed win now than risk getting nothing if we run out of rounds."
