Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping to secure a quick agreement and avoid the risk of inflation eating away at our potential gains.  Let's see what he thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is a lot less favorable to me than my initial offer to him. I'm willing to take a risk and see if we can reach a better agreement in the next round.  I believe I can do better!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly but am still aiming for a significant share of the money. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the risk of inflation. Let's see if Bob is willing to accept it this time."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting worse with each round. I'm still confident that I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not going to let the pressure of inflation force me into a bad agreement."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 700000, ""bob_gain"": 300000}
```

I'm going to continue to be a bit aggressive, but I'm also trying to be realistic. Bob's offer is getting worse each round, so I need to hold firm on my own gains to avoid ending up with a much smaller share."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting increasingly worse, but I'm not giving up just yet. The pressure of inflation is affecting him more, and I think I can still push for a better deal.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if we can reach a compromise that benefits us both."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 600000, ""bob_gain"": 400000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding out for a substantial share. Bob's offer is getting worse with each passing round, so I need to make sure I'm not giving up too much.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise before the inflation gets too out of control."
