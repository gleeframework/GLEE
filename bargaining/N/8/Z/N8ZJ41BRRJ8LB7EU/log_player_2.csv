Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round.

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, Alice's offer is now reasonably close to a 50/50 split after accounting for inflation.  Rejecting this offer carries a significant risk:

* **Further Rounds:** The remaining rounds will see the value of the money plummet for both of us.  
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has indicated this is a compromise.  There's a chance she becomes more demanding, not less, as time runs out. 
* **Potential for Loss:** If we fail to agree, we both get nothing, which is a far worse outcome than accepting a slightly uneven split."
