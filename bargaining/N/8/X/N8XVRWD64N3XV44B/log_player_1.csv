"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering to take 60 dollars and leaving 40 dollars for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully...

Since the money is worth 20% less, the actual value of the offer is:

* Alice gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40
* Bob gain: 50 * 0.8 = 40

It's a 50-50 split, which is a fair proposal. I'll accept Bob's offer.
