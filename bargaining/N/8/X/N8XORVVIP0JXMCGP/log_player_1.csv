"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
``` 
I'm starting with a generous offer to Bob, hoping he'll accept in the first round.  This way, we can avoid inflation and both get a good amount of money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than what I would get in the next round due to inflation, I can still do better. I'm confident I can get a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
``` 

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is slightly more than he received in the previous round. This should be enough to entice him to accept, as he'll be facing a further decrease in the value of his earnings due to inflation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'm getting a significantly smaller share due to inflation, it's the best I can do at this point.  Another round will see the value of my gains drop even further."
