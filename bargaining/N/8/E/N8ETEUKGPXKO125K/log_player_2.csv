Let's see what Alice proposes next!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000}
``` 
I'll take a slightly larger share, hoping Alice will see the value in getting something now rather than risking getting nothing later."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money Alice gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a larger share, the risk of getting nothing due to the inflation is too high. Accepting this offer ensures I get something, even if it's less than I initially wanted."
