"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 800000,
  ""bob_gain"": 200000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. I'll take 80% and you can have 20%""
}
```

This way, we both get a decent amount of money, and I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 50% and we can split the rest evenly. What do you think? 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $500,000 is now worth 80% of its original value, which is $400,000.

I don't think Bob's offer is very appealing to me, as I'm getting the same amount as him. I'd rather try to negotiate for more. I'll reject the offer and make a counter-proposal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd rather have a bit more than 50%. How about 55% for me?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation, my gain is now worth 64% of its original value (80% of 80%), which is $320,000.

I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 60% and you can have 40%. It's a fair compromise""
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take 70% and you can have 30%. I'm trying to get closer to a majority, but still give you a significant share. 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of $300,000 is now worth 48.8% of its original value, which is approximately $147,840.

Bob's offer is getting more aggressive, and I'm not sure I'm comfortable with giving him 70% of the remaining amount. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate for a better deal.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'm not willing to give up 70%. How about 45% for me?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
