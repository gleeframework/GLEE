"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, Bob. This offer gives me a slight advantage considering the inflation we're facing. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too advantageous for you. I propose a more balanced split while considering the inflation.""

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, let's be realistic.  The value decreases rapidly for me. This is a compromise, and I suggest taking it before inflation eats into it further. 
# Bob gain: 440000 
# Alice gain: 560000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is trying to pressure me with the inflation rate, but her offer is still heavily skewed in her favor. It's better to hold out for a more equitable split.  I need to increase the pressure on her, as she is the one losing value, not me."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 575000,
""alice_gain"": 425000,
""message"": ""Alice, time is running out, and your losses are mounting. I'm offering a reasonable deal considering the circumstances. Let's be sensible and close this.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, this back and forth is pointless. My offer is fair, and the clock is ticking. Let's settle this before we both lose out. 
# Bob gain: 470000 
# Alice gain: 530000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting desperate, and her language reflects that. However, her offer is still not reflective of the rapidly decreasing value she's facing.  While 470,000 is tempting, holding out for one more round might force her to make a much bigger concession."

Round 6
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, this is my final offer.  Take it or leave it. The devaluation is working against you significantly.  This is your last chance for a sizeable share.""
