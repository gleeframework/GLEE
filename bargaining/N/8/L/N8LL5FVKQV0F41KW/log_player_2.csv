"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but we'll see how this goes. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While it's tempting to take the $100,000, it's better to reject and see what Alice offers in the next round.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal, especially since the money will be worth less for Alice in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
