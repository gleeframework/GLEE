I'm starting with a very generous offer to Bob, hoping to end the game quickly.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

While I would have preferred more, the inflation is eating away at the value of the money quickly. Accepting a 50/50 split is the safest option to guarantee a significant gain, even with the inflation."
