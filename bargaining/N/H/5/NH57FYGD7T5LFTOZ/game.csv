550000.0,450000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. This gives you a good amount, and I still get a decent chunk after the inflation hit.",Alice,3,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, we're running out of time. My counter-offer is 55/45 in my favor. This takes into account the increasing impact of inflation on your share as each round passes.",Bob,4,
