"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I get 90% and you get 10%.  We can always adjust if this isn't working for you. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

That's a very uneven split in Alice's favor. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept such a low amount."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 600000,
""alice_gain"": 400000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's be more realistic. I propose a 60/40 split in my favor.  This reflects that the value decreases for both of us over time, although at different rates.""
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I need a larger share to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's split it 55/45 in my favor. This gives you a good amount, and I still get a decent chunk after the inflation hit. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

Alice is still heavily favoring herself in this deal, even with the inflation acknowledged. I need to push for a more equitable split."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 550000,
""alice_gain"": 450000,
""message"": ""Alice, we're running out of time. My counter-offer is 55/45 in my favor. This takes into account the increasing impact of inflation on your share as each round passes."" 
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's meet in the middle.  50/50 split. We both get a fair share, and we avoid the risk of losing everything due to inflation. 
# Bob gain: 500000 
# Alice gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}

This is the most equitable offer we're likely to reach. A 50/50 split ensures we both benefit, and the longer we wait, the more Alice loses to inflation.  It's a fair deal."
