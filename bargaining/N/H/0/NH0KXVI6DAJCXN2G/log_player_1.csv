"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 500000,
  ""bob_gain"": 500000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, Bob. What do you say?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a small share, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 200000 
# Bob gain: 800000 
Do you accept this offer?","Not a great start to the negotiations!

For Round 2, I'll have to consider the reduced value of the money due to inflation. Since the money is worth 10% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

After considering it, I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 20/80 split, especially since the money is already worth less than it was in the first round. I'll try to do better in the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","For Round 3, I'll make a new offer, taking into account the reduced value of the money due to inflation.

Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise.""
}
```

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny share, but I think I'm being generous 
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the value of the money is dropping rapidly due to inflation!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, I'm not willing to accept such a small share, especially since Bob is trying to take the lion's share.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."

  ""message"": ""I'll give you a slightly smaller share, but I think this is a fair compromise considering the inflation.""

I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can move forward, but I'm not getting any younger in these negotiations!"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a tiny share, but I think I'm being extremely generous considering the situation 
# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting due to inflation! I'm starting to feel the pressure.

However, I'm not willing to accept such a tiny share, even if Bob thinks he's being generous. I need to think about my long-term prospects and not just the short-term gain.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 6:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'll try to negotiate a better deal in the next round, but I'm running out of time!"

# Bob gain: 990000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is dropping rapidly due to inflation, and Bob's offers are getting more and more insulting.

I'm not willing to accept such an outrageously small share, even if Bob thinks he's being generous. I need to stand firm and try to get a better deal.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 8:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm getting desperate, but I won't give in to Bob's lowball offers."

I'm not willing to accept such an insultingly small share, even if Bob thinks he's being generous. I need to stand firm and try to get a better deal, but I'm running out of time.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 10:

# Alice gain: 500 
# Bob gain: 999500 
Do you accept this offer?","The final round.

I'm shocked by Bob's offer. A 500-dollar share is an insult, and I'm not going to accept it. I've been trying to negotiate a fair deal throughout the game, but Bob's refusal to compromise has led us to this point.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 12:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

Since we've reached the final round and neither of us has accepted the other's offer, I suppose we'll have to split the remaining money 50/50, as per the game's rules."
