```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems fair and straightforward. Your turn, Bob!"

Round 5

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a bite out of the money's value! With the value of my potential gain decreasing so rapidly, I'll have to be extremely cautious.

Considering the offer, I'll have to think carefully... but I think I'll reject this offer. The value of $100,000 is relatively small compared to the original $1,000,000, and I'd like to try to get a better deal.

  ""bob_gain"": 100000

# Alice gain: 50000 
# Bob gain: 950000 
Do you accept this offer?","The value of the money is plummeting! With the value of my potential gain decreasing so drastically, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

However, considering the extremely low value of the money and the fact that I'm running out of rounds, I'll have to accept this offer. $50,000 is a tiny fraction of the original $1,000,000, but it's better than getting nothing.
