"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split, with me getting $6,000 and Bob getting $4,000. This is a relatively generous offer, considering the game is just starting and the money is still worth a lot."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Meet me in the middle! 
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less for me and 20% less for Bob, the effective amounts are:

* My gain: $6,000 * 0.9 = $5,400
* Bob's gain: $4,000 * 0.8 = $3,200

Considering Bob's new offer, the effective amounts are:

* Alice gain: $5,000
* Bob gain: $5,000

Since the amounts are now equal, I'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and the effects of inflation.
