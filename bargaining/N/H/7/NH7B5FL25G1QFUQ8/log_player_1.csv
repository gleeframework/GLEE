"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50 to start. Your turn!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm looking forward to seeing Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a smaller share, but I think I deserve more for taking the risk of negotiating 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money worth 20% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'm not as enthusiastic about the offer as I was initially.

However, I think Bob has a point about taking the risk of negotiating, and I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept this offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
