I'm going to start with a pretty generous offer, aiming for a quick resolution. I'll take 90% and give Bob 10% of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I'm going to reject this offer.  While I'm losing value each round, Bob is losing value at a much faster rate. I believe I can get a better deal if we continue negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 800000, ""bob_gain"": 200000}
```

I'm going to offer Bob 20% of the money this time.  I'm still aiming for a good deal for myself, but I'm hoping to find a compromise that will be appealing to Bob in light of the inflation affecting him much more severely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject this offer.  Bob's offer is getting closer to what I want, but the inflation is hitting him hard and I'm still in a better position to negotiate.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal that's fairer for both of us."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 750000, ""bob_gain"": 250000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to 750,000 for myself and offering Bob 250,000.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer for Bob as the inflation continues to affect him more drastically."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 67.23% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

This is getting risky, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Inflation is really hurting Bob, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal.  While the money I'm getting is worth less than my initial offer, it's still a decent amount."
