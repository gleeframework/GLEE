Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor.  I'm willing to take a slight hit due to inflation, but let's make it more even. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800

Round 4
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're running out of time. I'm sticking to my previous offer.  It's a fair deal considering the inflation is working against me. 
# Alice gain: 5200 
# Bob gain: 4800 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is getting more stubborn, but time is on my side. The longer we wait, the more unattractive his 4800 becomes due to inflation, while my potential gain stays the same.  I need to apply more pressure without seeming completely unreasonable."

Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","```json
{
""alice_gain"": 5500,

""message"": ""Bob, let's be realistic.  The clock is ticking, and that impacts you more than me. This is my final offer.""

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting ridiculous.  I'm losing money with every round we waste, and this offer is more than fair to you. Take it or leave it. 
# Alice gain: 5300 
# Bob gain: 4700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{
""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Time Pressure:**  With only 6 rounds remaining, the time pressure is significant. Bob's offer is now quite close to my previous one, and waiting might lead to him lowering his offer even further. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** The longer the game goes, the less attractive Bob's share becomes due to the 5% inflation working against him each round. However, this also means his potential losses from his initial offer are shrinking. He's likely to dig in and become less flexible. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Rejecting this offer risks walking away with nothing if I misjudge Bob's resolve. Accepting guarantees a reasonable share (5300), even if it's slightly less than I aimed for initially. 

It's a tough call, but sometimes a sure thing outweighs the potential for a slightly better outcome with significant risk."
