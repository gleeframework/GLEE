Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60-40, a fair starting point!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100, which is $60, and Bob gets 40%, which is $40."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.

# Bob's message: Let's try a 60-40 split in my favor this time. It's a fair chance for you to get a decent share before the money shrinks further. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not too thrilled about Bob getting 60% of the remaining $100, but I'll consider it.
