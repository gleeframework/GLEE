"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob. I think we can do better in the next round, though.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount, hoping that he'll be eager to negotiate and we can improve the terms in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 55/45 split is more fair, considering the inflation we both face. Let's work together to maximize our gains. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about Bob's offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm rejecting this offer because I think I can do better. A 45/55 split still favors Bob, and I'm hoping to negotiate a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you in the middle, Bob. Let's split it 50/50 for now, but I'm still hoping to negotiate a better deal in the next round.""
}
```

I'm offering a 50/50 split, which is a fair deal considering the current market conditions. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm still keeping my eyes on the prize and planning to negotiate further in the next round."
