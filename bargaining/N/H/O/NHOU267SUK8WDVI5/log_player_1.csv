{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing that I get 60% of the initial $100 and Bob gets 40%."

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split, with me getting the larger share, is more fair, considering the inflation.  Let's finish this now. 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 55, ""bob_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I'll compromise on 55/45, considering the inflation. Your turn!""}

I'm proposing a slightly more favorable split for myself, but still a reasonable compromise considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation."
