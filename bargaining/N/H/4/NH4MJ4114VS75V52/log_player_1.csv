"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a pretty generous offer, hoping Bob will accept and we can both walk away with something.  Let's see what he does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While a 50/50 split seems fair on the surface, remember inflation! My share is worth 20% less than it would have been in the first round.  I'm willing to hold out for a better deal, especially since we have 10 more rounds to go."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000} 
```

I'm going to try a slightly less generous offer this time.  Since Bob rejected my last offer, I'm hoping this compromise will be more appealing.  Inflation is a big factor here, so I'm still prioritizing getting a larger share of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer.  Inflation has hit me hard, but I know Bob is also experiencing some inflation, although it's not as severe.  I'm determined to get a better deal, and with 8 rounds remaining, I'm confident we can reach a more equitable solution."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000} 
```

This is my final attempt at a compromise.  Inflation is impacting me greatly, but I'm still trying to be fair to Bob.  If this offer is rejected, we're going to be in a very difficult situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 67.23% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm rejecting this offer, even though it's incredibly tempting.  While inflation has been brutal, I still believe I can get a better deal. We have 6 rounds left, and I'm not giving up yet.  I'm holding out for a more equitable split, especially since Bob's inflation is not as severe as mine."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000} 
```

This is my last attempt at a compromise. Inflation has devastated my potential gains, and I'm now at the point where even a 50/50 split would be a decent outcome. I'm hoping Bob sees the dire situation we're in and accepts this offer.  If not, we both risk walking away with nothing."
