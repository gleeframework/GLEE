"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my first offer:

{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}

I'm offering Bob $4,000, and I'll take $6,000. This is a pretty straightforward 60-40 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation factor in mind, I'll evaluate Bob's offer. Since the money I gain is worth the same as in the first round, $6,000 is still a significant amount.

However, considering the inflation, Bob's offer is actually more favorable to him than it initially seems. His $7,000 is only worth 80% of the original amount, which is $5,600. So, in real terms, he's offering me $6,000 and taking $5,600.

I'll accept this offer to get the guaranteed $6,000.
