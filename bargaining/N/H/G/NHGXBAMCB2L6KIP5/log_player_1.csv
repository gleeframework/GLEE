"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair, considering we both have the chance to make a better deal in the next round. 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
 
I'll reject this offer. While a 60/40 split seems fair at face value, the inflation factor means it's actually a worse deal for me than the initial 90/10 split. I'll take my chances with the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
