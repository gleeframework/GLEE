"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, let's split it evenly to be fair. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nSince the offer is to split the money evenly, which is the most fair and reasonable proposal, I see no reason to reject it and risk getting a worse offer in the next round. Accepting this offer guarantees me $50, which is half of the total amount, and it ends the game on a fair note for both players."
