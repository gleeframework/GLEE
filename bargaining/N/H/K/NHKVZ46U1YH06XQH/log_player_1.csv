"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, no need to negotiate further?""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, which seems fair and straightforward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're leaving too much on the table, let's make a deal now! 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation affecting my gain, I need to be more cautious. Since the money I gain is worth 10% less, I'd rather not accept an offer that leaves me with $3,000, which is equivalent to $3,000 / 0.9 = $3,333.33 in the first round.

I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4500,
  ""bob_gain"": 5500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a slightly larger share, but I need a good reason to give up more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly larger share, but I'm still holding on to a larger portion for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm not budging much 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation rate affecting my gain, I need to be even more careful. Since the money I gain is worth 27.1% less, $4,000 is equivalent to $4,000 / 0.721 = $5,554.92 in the first round, which is a significant increase from the previous offer.

However, I'm not sure if I should accept this offer, as Bob's gain is still relatively high. I'll think about it for a moment...

After considering the numbers, I'll reject this offer and wait for a better one.

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","With the inflation rate affecting my gain, I'll aim for an even higher share. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 4200,
  ""bob_gain"": 5800,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a good reason to give up more.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a slightly smaller share, but I'm still trying to maximize my gain in this inflationary environment."
