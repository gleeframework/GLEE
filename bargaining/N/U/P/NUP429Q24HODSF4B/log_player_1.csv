"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair and divide it 60-40""}\n\n###\n\nI'm offering Bob $4,000 and taking $6,000 for myself. Let's see if he accepts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's switch the roles. I think a 60-40 split is fair, given the inflation rate. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI won't accept this offer. The inflation has already reduced the value of my potential gain, and accepting this would give me an even smaller share than before. Let's proceed to the next round and see if I can make a better proposal!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Considering inflation, I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's try 58-42""}\n\n###\n\nI've taken into account the inflation and decided to offer Bob a bit more than before, while still trying to get a larger share for myself. Fingers crossed he'll accept this one!"
