"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a reasonable offer. I believe this split accounts for our positions in the game. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 650000,
""alice_gain"": 350000,
""message"": ""Alice, your offer was a bit too skewed in your favor. Let's be realistic, the depreciation hits you harder than it hits me. This offer reflects the time pressure we both face.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand the time pressure, but your offer was significantly in your favor. This is my final offer before the depreciation makes this pointless for me. 
# Bob gain: 450000 
# Alice gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

Reasoning:

- **Time pressure:**  The longer the game goes, the less the money is worth to both of us, but especially to Alice. 
- **Alice's position weakening:** Her offer is getting better for me. This indicates she feels the pressure of the devaluation.
- **Risk vs. Reward:** Holding out for a slightly better deal in Round 4 is very risky. The devaluation will be significant, and there's no guarantee Alice won't offer me even less.

This offer is still somewhat in Alice's favor, but the depreciation makes it a reasonable compromise to accept now.
