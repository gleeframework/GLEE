Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. How about you get 4000 and I get 6000 this round?  It's still a good deal for you before inflation eats away at it more. 
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
