"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my initial offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount, and keeping $600,000 for myself, which is 60% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of the money due to inflation, my gain of $450,000 is now worth 90% of $450,000, which is $405,000, and Bob's gain of $550,000 is now worth 80% of $550,000, which is $440,000.

I'm not sure if this is a good deal for me, considering the reduced value of the money. I'll reject this offer.

Round 3

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000, which is 58% of the original amount, and keeping $420,000 for myself, which is 42% of the original amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 580000 
# Bob gain: 420000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to reverse the offer from round 3!

Considering the continued inflation, my gain of $580,000 is now worth 72.9% of the original $600,000 (from round 1), which is $436,400, and Bob's gain of $420,000 is now worth 42% of the original $400,000 (from round 1), which is $168,000.

I'll accept this offer, as it's a better deal for me than my previous offer.
