"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's be fair and start with 60-40""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is a generous 40% of the total amount, while I'll take $600,000. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable starting point and accept the offer. Fingers crossed!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: That's a bit greedy Alice! How about a 55/45 split in my favor? It's still a good deal for you considering the inflation. 
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:


{
  ""alice_gain"": 570000,
  ""bob_gain"": 430000,
  ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle, considering the inflation""
}

I've adjusted my offer to be closer to the middle, taking into account the 10% decrease in value from the first round and the previous offer from Bob. I'm hoping this will be more acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is getting ridiculous, Alice. We're losing money with every round! I propose an even 50/50 split. Let's end this before we both get burned. 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}"
