**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, it's important to recognize the impact of inflation and the diminishing value of the potential gains. 

* **Further Losses:** Rejecting this offer means risking even greater losses in subsequent rounds due to inflation.
* **Alice's Position:** Alice is clearly aware of the advantage inflation gives her and is unlikely to settle for a significantly smaller share. 

Accepting this offer cuts losses and ensures receiving a reasonable, albeit reduced, sum."
