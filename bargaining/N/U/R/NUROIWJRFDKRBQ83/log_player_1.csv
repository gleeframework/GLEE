"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 90, ""bob_gain"": 10}
```

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to secure a large portion of the money. I'm aware of the inflation, but hoping Bob will accept in the first round to avoid any potential loss on his end."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5 
# Bob gain: 95 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

While Bob's offer is extremely unfavorable, I'm aware of the 5% inflation and that accepting would result in a significant loss for me. I'll reject and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}
```

I'm increasing my proposed gain slightly from the first round, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. While inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'm aiming for a more balanced division to avoid further rounds of negotiation."
