"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my first offer:

```
{""alice_gain"": 70, ""bob_gain"": 30}
```

This way, I get 70% of the initial $100, and Bob gets 30%."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 60 
# Bob gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","With the reduced value of money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since the money is worth less now, I'd like to try to get a bit more. However, Bob's offer is still a good one, and it's not clear if I can do better.

I'll accept this offer.
