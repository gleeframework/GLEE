"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering a 60-40 split, which I think is a reasonable starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a slightly more even split is fairer, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my gain of 4500 is now worth 90% of what it was in the first round, so I'll have to adjust my thinking accordingly.

After considering Bob's offer, I think it's a bit more generous than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll accept his offer.
