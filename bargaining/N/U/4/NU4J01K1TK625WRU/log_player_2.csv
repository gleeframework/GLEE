"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it evenly. Fair is fair! 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to make a counteroffer. Since the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I might be able to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\n{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, I think this is a fairer split.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth 10% less for Alice in each subsequent round, I'm trying to take advantage of this by offering her a slightly smaller share, while still being somewhat reasonable. Let's see how she responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation is impacting me, but I'm willing to offer a slightly better split for you. Let's get this done! 
# Bob gain: 45 
# Alice gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because Alice is still trying to get the larger share, despite the money being worth less to her due to inflation. I want to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth the same to me in every round, so I'll try to negotiate an even better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 60, ""alice_gain"": 40, ""message"": ""Considering the increasing impact of inflation on your share, I believe this split is more reasonable.""}\n\n###\n\nSince the money is worth even less to Alice now (19% less than the original), I'm going to try to take a larger share. I'm still being somewhat reasonable, but I want to take advantage of the fact that the money is worth the same to me in every round. Let's see how Alice responds!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 34.39% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go even further to avoid another round. This is my final offer. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll reject this offer because, despite Alice's claim that it's her final offer, I believe she's still not taking into account the significant impact of inflation on her share. The money is now worth 34.39% less to her than in the first round, so I think I can negotiate an even better deal. I'll wait for the next round to make another counteroffer."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","{""bob_gain"": 65, ""alice_gain"": 35, ""message"": ""Given the substantial effect of inflation on your share, I think this is a more realistic split. I'm willing to end the game here.""}\n\n###\n\nConsidering the significant decrease in value for Alice (34.39% less than the original), I'm going to try to take an even larger share. I'm still leaving some room for negotiation, but I want to emphasize that the money is worth the same to me in every round, so I have an advantage in this game. Let's see how Alice responds! If she rejects, I might need to reconsider my strategy."
