Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, let's be reasonable. I understand you want a larger share, but my offer ensures a much fairer split considering the inflation working against me. 
# Alice gain: 350000 
# Bob gain: 650000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
