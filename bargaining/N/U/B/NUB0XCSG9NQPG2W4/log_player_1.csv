"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 60/40, a fair start!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial $10,000, which is $4,000, and keeping $6,000 for myself. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the lead, but you can still get a decent share 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the inflation, my share of $6,000 is now worth $4,800 (20% less).

Considering Bob's offer, I'll have to accept $3,000, which is 30% of the current value of the money. It's a decent share, but I'm not sure if I should hold out for more.

I'll decide to accept Bob's offer for now.
