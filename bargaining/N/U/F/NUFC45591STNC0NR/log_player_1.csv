I'm going to propose a 90/10 split, keeping 900,000 for myself and giving Bob 100,000.  It's a pretty generous offer, considering I have no idea how inflation affects him!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 
I reject this offer.  While it's tempting to take the 100,000, I'm sure I can get a better deal.  The inflation is working in my favor now, and I'm confident I can push for a more even split."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 550000, ""bob_gain"": 450000}
```

I'm going to propose a 55/45 split this time.  I'm willing to compromise a little bit, but I still want a good chunk of the money.  Let's see if Bob's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 450000 
# Bob gain: 550000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
```

I'll accept this offer. Even though the inflation has reduced the value of the money significantly, taking 450,000 is better than risking getting nothing at all in the next round. Bob seems determined to get the larger share, and I don't think I can get a better deal at this point."
