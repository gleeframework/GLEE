Alice's offer:

It's too early to accept a deal. I want to see what Alice is willing to offer in later rounds."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 6000, ""alice_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""I propose a more balanced split, taking into account the inflation we both face.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering the inflation hit, I'm giving a bit more room, but let's be realistic! 
# Bob gain: 4300 
# Alice gain: 5700 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Alice's offer is slightly better than her first offer, and the inflation is starting to hurt. It's better to accept now than risk getting a worse offer later."
