"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 80,
  ""bob_gain"": 20,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair share""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 20% of the initial $100, which is $20, and keeping 80% for myself, which is $80. I'm starting with a fair share, hoping Bob will accept and we can end the game here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Take a slightly higher offer 
# Alice gain: 70 
# Bob gain: 30 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 20% less, I'll have to think carefully about this offer.

Since the money is worth less, I'll have to adjust my expectations. In this case, I'll accept Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the $70 and call it a day."
