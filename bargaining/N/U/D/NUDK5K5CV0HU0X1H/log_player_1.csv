"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's split fairly considering the inflation""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which might seem a bit low, but considering the inflation rate, it's actually a pretty good deal for him. If he waits, the money will be worth 20% less for him in the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is fair given the inflation rates, with me getting a bit more since I'm losing value faster. Let's end this quickly! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 57,
  ""bob_gain"": 43,
  ""message"": ""Considering the inflation, my previous offer was generous. This is a more reasonable split.""
}
```

I've reduced my share slightly, but I'm still taking into account the fact that the money is worth less to me with each passing round, and much less to Bob. I'm hoping he'll see the sense in accepting this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still losing value faster than you. This offer is closer to what I think is fair, but I'm willing to negotiate further. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""You're running out of time, the money is losing value fast. This is a good deal for you.""
}
```

I've increased my share slightly, as the money is worth even less to Bob now, and I'm hoping he'll realize that it's better to accept this offer rather than risk losing even more value in the next round."
