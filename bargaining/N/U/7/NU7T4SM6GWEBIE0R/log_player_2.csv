"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be fair, 60-40 is a good deal! 
# Bob gain: 4000 
# Alice gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:** While the 60/40 split seems tempting in the first round, it heavily favors Alice. The inflation rate works heavily in my favor. As Bob, my priority is to push the game towards later rounds where my share will be worth significantly more due to the difference in inflation rates."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 4500,
""alice_gain"": 5500,
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but it needs to be more balanced. How about this?""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Delay:**  The goal is still to push the game to later rounds for a more favorable outcome due to inflation. 
* **Appearance of Compromise:**  Offering a slightly better deal (from Alice's perspective) gives the appearance of compromise and makes it more likely Alice will consider future offers.
* **Future Leverage:** This offer sets a benchmark for future negotiations. If Alice rejects this, it opens the door for me to argue for an even larger share in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, 58-42 is as balanced as it gets! 
# Bob gain: 4200 
# Alice gain: 5800 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}

**Reasoning:** Alice is barely budging, likely hoping I'll panic as we approach the later rounds. However, even with the 36% inflation for me, time is still on my side. Another rejection puts further pressure on her and gives me a stronger position to negotiate from in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{
""bob_gain"": 5000,
""alice_gain"": 5000,
""message"": ""Alice, let's stop wasting time. A 50/50 split is the fairest and most efficient way to settle this.""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  While more rounds benefit me, Alice is likely feeling the pressure too with the decreasing value. Offering a 50/50 split now seems more appealing due to the time constraint.
* **Image of Fairness:**  Proposing an even split reinforces my position as being reasonable and willing to compromise. This can be persuasive, especially if Alice is getting anxious about running out of time.
* **Strategic Risk:** It's a calculated risk. There's a chance Alice might reject this, hoping for a slightly better deal in later rounds. However, the 50/50 split sets a strong precedent that makes it harder for her to justify accepting anything significantly less favorable to her later on."
