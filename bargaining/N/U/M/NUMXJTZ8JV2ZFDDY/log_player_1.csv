"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it 70-30, I'll get the smaller share this round""
}
```

I'm offering Bob a 30% share, which is $300,000, and I'll take the remaining 70% share, which is $700,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I propose we split it 75/25, I'll take the bigger share this time.  It's a fairer deal since you got the larger share last round. 
# Alice gain: 250000 
# Bob gain: 750000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not convinced by Bob's argument that I got the larger share last round, since I was just trying to make a good offer initially. But I do see that the stakes are now lower due to inflation.

I'll reject this offer and try to make a new proposal that takes into account the lower value of the money.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation has reduced the value of the money, I'll aim for a higher share this time. Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take a bigger share this round, but I'll give you a fair deal""
}
```"
