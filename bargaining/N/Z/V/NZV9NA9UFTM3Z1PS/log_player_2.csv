"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start fair. I'll take the lion's share this round, but hopefully we can find a more balanced agreement later. 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While it's tempting to take the $1000, it's a very small amount. Rejecting allows me to propose a more equitable split in the next round, and with inflation, the $10,000 will be worth less for Alice if we go to round 2."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5000, ""alice_gain"": 5000, ""message"": ""Let's split it evenly.  We'll both get more this way than if we continue to haggle.""}
