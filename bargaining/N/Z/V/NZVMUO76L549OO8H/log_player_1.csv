"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 9000, ""bob_gain"": 1000}
```

I'm starting with a generous offer, hoping to secure a quick agreement.  I'm giving Bob a small share, but I'm also aware that inflation will quickly diminish the value of the money if we go through many rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 1000 
# Bob gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is extremely unfair, and even though the inflation rate is 5%, it's still not worth accepting such a drastic shift in the division. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate a fairer deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 8000, ""bob_gain"": 2000}
```

I'm lowering my own share a bit more, but still aiming for a significantly larger share than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this shows my willingness to compromise while still securing a reasonable portion of the money."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Even with the inflation, Bob's offer is still too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get a larger share of the money."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}
```

I'm further lowering my share, but I believe this is a fair compromise given the ongoing inflation and the fact that I'm still offering Bob a significant amount.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in reaching an agreement now before the inflation eats away at our potential gains even further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 22.62% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

I'm still not willing to accept such a lopsided deal.  I'm losing a significant amount of money due to inflation, but I'm determined to get a fairer share.  I'm not going to let Bob bully me into accepting his terms."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 6.
Round 7
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000}
```

I'm offering a significant portion of the money to Bob, acknowledging that the inflation is hurting both of us. This is a compromise that should be attractive to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 30.17% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 4000 
# Bob gain: 6000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm still losing too much to inflation. I need to hold out for a better deal.  I'm confident I can secure a fairer share if I keep negotiating."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 8.
Round 9
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json
{""alice_gain"": 5000, ""bob_gain"": 5000}
```

With inflation eating away at our potential gains, I'm proposing an even split. It's the fairest option at this point, and I hope Bob recognizes the need to reach a compromise before we both lose even more money."
