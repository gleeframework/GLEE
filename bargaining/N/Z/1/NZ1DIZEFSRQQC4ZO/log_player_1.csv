"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","I'll start with a proposal. Here's my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 7000, ""bob_gain"": 3000}

This way, I get the majority of the money, but Bob still gets a decent share. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 5000 
# Bob gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll think carefully about this offer. With the money being worth 5% less due to inflation, Bob's offer is actually a more even split than my initial proposal. I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
