"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my offer:

{""alice_gain"": 50, ""bob_gain"": 50, ""message"": ""Let's split it 50/50, a fair start!""}

I'm proposing a 50/50 split, giving us both $50 each."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 40, you can do better than that! 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the offer, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll have to adjust my thinking. In this case, I'd be getting $32 (40 x 0.8) and Bob would get $48 (60 x 0.8).

I'll reject this offer and try to do better.

{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer:

{""alice_gain"": 45, ""bob_gain"": 55, ""message"": ""I'll give you a bit more, but I'm not going to get taken advantage of!""}

I'm proposing a 45/55 split, giving Bob a slightly better deal than my initial offer, but still trying to keep a decent amount for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're getting desperate, I'll give you 30, but that's my final offer! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","Ouch, the inflation is really taking a toll on me!

Considering the reduced value of the money, I'd be getting $15.36 (30 x 0.508) and Bob would get $32.64 (70 x 0.508).

I'm not thrilled about this offer, but I'm getting desperate too. I'll accept this offer, hoping that Bob will keep his word and not try to back out.
