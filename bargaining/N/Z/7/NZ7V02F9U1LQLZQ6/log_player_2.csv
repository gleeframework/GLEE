"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Bob gain: 190000 
# Alice gain: 810000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Inflation:**  The money is worth less each round. Even though the offer is less than the first round, the inflation is hurting Bob much more significantly. 
* **Risk:**  Rejecting this offer means Alice gets to propose in the next round, and there's no guarantee that her offer will be better. It's likely to be worse due to inflation. 
* **Potential for Future Offers:** While this offer isn't great, it's better than the potential for further losses due to inflation and the risk of Alice making a less favorable offer in the next round."
