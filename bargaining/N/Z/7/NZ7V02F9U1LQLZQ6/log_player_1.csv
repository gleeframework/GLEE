I'm going for a 90/10 split in my favor.  It's a bold move, but I figure Bob might accept it since he doesn't know about the inflation.  Let's see how he reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

I reject this offer.  While I'm getting a smaller cut this round, I still have the advantage of knowing about the inflation. I can likely get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3

I'm offering an 81/19 split in my favor. Bob's offer was ridiculous, so I'm pushing back a bit. Since the inflation hits him harder, I'm going for a larger chunk this time.  Let's see if he bites."
