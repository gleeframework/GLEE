Send your offer to divide $10,000.","```json

I'm going to start with a fairly aggressive offer, aiming to get the majority of the money. I'm hoping Bob will be reasonable and accept this offer in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 20% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

``` 

While I'd prefer more, I'm not sure how much longer this game will go on. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a significant amount of money, and the inflation could hurt me in the next round."
