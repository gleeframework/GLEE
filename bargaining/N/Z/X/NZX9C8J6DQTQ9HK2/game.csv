,,,Bob,1,reject
300000.0,700000.0,"Alice, my turn. I'm feeling generous, but let's not drag this out.  700,000 for me, 300,000 for you. Deal?",Bob,2,

800000.0,200000.0,"I'm willing to compromise, Bob. Let's split it 80/20. This is a fair offer given the inflation.",Alice,3,

400000.0,600000.0,"Okay Alice, let's try this again. 60/40 split.  It's a better deal than your last one, and time is ticking away for both of us.",Bob,4,

700000.0,300000.0,"Bob, we're getting closer to the end. I'm willing to meet you halfway at 70/30.  It's the best offer I can make before the inflation really hits.",Alice,5,

450000.0,550000.0,"Alice, time is running out, and the inflation is eating away at my share.  I'm proposing a 55/45 split.  It's a compromise, and it gets us both a decent amount before the value drops even further.",Bob,6,

650000.0,350000.0,"Bob, I'm getting nervous now. We need to agree soon.  I'm proposing 65/35. It's a fair deal with the inflation, and I'm not sure how much more I can give.",Alice,7,
,,,Bob,7,reject
500000.0,500000.0,"Alice, this is getting ridiculous. Let's end this now with a clean, fair 50/50 split.  It's the only sensible option with the time constraint and the shrinking pot.",Bob,8,
