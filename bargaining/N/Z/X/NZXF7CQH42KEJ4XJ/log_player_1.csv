Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I came down a bit from my last thought, considering inflation. Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Alice gain: 4800 
# Bob gain: 5200 
Do you accept this offer?","```json

""decision"": ""reject""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is being stubborn and only making very small concessions.  We're already down to 72.9% of the original value. I'm willing to push closer to 50/50, but Bob needs to make a significant move to show he's negotiating fairly."
