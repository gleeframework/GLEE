Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 18.55% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Inflation is biting, need a better split 
# Bob gain: 47 
# Alice gain: 53 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting steadily more desperate as inflation eats into her potential gains. While my own buying power remains consistent, hers is diminishing.  I'll hold out for a better offer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 48, ""alice_gain"": 52, ""message"": ""Let's settle this fairly.  I've made a concession, time for you to accept.""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I've slightly increased my offer from 49/51 to 48/52. This shows a willingness to compromise but not be taken advantage of.
* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the pressure mounts for Alice. Offering a reasonable deal while reminding her of the ticking clock might sway her. 
* **Avoiding Greed:**  Holding out for significantly more could backfire. It's crucial to find a balance between maximizing my gains and ensuring a deal is struck."
