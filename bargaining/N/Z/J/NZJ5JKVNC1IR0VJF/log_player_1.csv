"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","```json

I'm proposing to take $999,000 and leave $1,000 for Bob.  I know it's a big disparity, but I'm hoping he'll accept it in the first round to avoid any potential inflation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation,  the money Bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 100000 
# Bob gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I would prefer more money, it's better to accept this offer.  The inflation is a significant factor, and there's no guarantee I'll get a better deal in the next round.  It's better to secure at least some profit now than risk getting nothing later."
