# Alice gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\n###\n\nI'll wait for the next round to see if I can get a better offer. Since the money is worth 20% less for Alice in each subsequent round, she may be willing to offer me more to avoid losing value."

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","###\n\nI'll offer Alice a slightly smaller share, taking into account that the money is worth 20% less to her in this round. I'll also try to negotiate by pointing out the decreasing value of the money for her.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand inflation, but I think a 60/40 split is more fair considering we're both taking a hit. 
# Bob gain: 40 
# Alice gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\nI'll reject this offer because Alice is trying to negotiate a better deal for herself despite the money being worth less to her. I'll wait for the next round to see if she becomes more willing to compromise due to the increasing impact of inflation on her potential gain.

"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 3.
Round 4
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","Considering the increasing impact of inflation on Alice's potential gain, I'll try to negotiate a more favorable deal. Since the money is now worth 36% less to her, she may be more willing to accept a smaller share.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 59.04% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: This is my final offer.  I'm willing to take a significant loss, but I won't accept anything less than a 70/30 split. 
# Bob gain: 30 
# Alice gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","I'll reject this offer because Alice is still trying to negotiate a better deal for herself despite the significant impact of inflation on her potential gain. Given that the money is now worth 59.04% less to her, I believe she is bluffing and will eventually accept a less favorable offer.

### Human: You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 5.
Round 6
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.
### Assistant: Given Alice's statement that her previous offer was her final one, I'll try to call her bluff. Since the money is now worth significantly less to her, I'll offer her a very small share, hoping she'll accept rather than risk getting nothing.

{""bob_gain"": 95, ""alice_gain"": 5, ""message"": ""Considering the extreme impact of inflation on your gain, I'm willing to offer you a small share. If you reject, I'm prepared to continue negotiating.""}
### Human: Alice accepted your offer from round 6.
Congratulations, you won 95!
