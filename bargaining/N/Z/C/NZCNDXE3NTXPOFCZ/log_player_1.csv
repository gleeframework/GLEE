"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 50,
  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept and we can end the game early!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which seems like a reasonable starting point. Now it's up to Bob to decide whether to accept or reject the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, I'll take a slightly larger share this time 
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation, my gain is worth 10% less, so I need to be more cautious with my decisions.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 2:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I think 60% for Bob is too high, and I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 45,
  ""bob_gain"": 55,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly larger share this time.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect the inflation and trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 14.26% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too soft on me, I'll take a bigger share this time 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With inflation taking a bigger toll on my gains, I need to be even more cautious.

I'll reject Bob's offer for Round 4:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

70% for Bob is too high, and I'm not willing to give up that much more. I'd like to try to negotiate a better deal for myself."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my new offer for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm not getting any younger, let's split it a bit more evenly now.""
}
```

I'm adjusting my proposal to reflect the increasing inflation, but I'm still trying to get a slightly better deal for myself."
