Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your reasoning for a 60/40 split, but I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is a fairer starting point, given the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits us both. 
# Alice gain: 45 
# Bob gain: 55 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
