Alice's offer:

{""bob_gain"": 55, ""alice_gain"": 45, ""message"": ""I understand your reasoning for a 60/40 split, but I believe a 55/45 split in my favor is a fairer starting point, given the impact of inflation on both of us. Let's see if we can find a solution that benefits us both.""}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's be reasonable.  The inflation is impacting both of us, so a 50/50 split seems like the fairest option at this point.  We can continue to argue about who gets a slightly larger share, but that just risks us both losing out in the end. 
# Bob gain: 50 
# Alice gain: 50
