"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000,
  ""message"": ""Accept this offer and we can split the money fairly.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 300,000$ and keeping 700,000$ for myself. My message is a friendly reminder that this is a fair split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's split it 50/50 and be done with it! 
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is affecting me!

I don't think splitting it 50/50 is a bad idea, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject"",
  ""message"": ""I'd like to get a bit more. Can you offer me 55%?""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","The money is worth even less now due to inflation!

Here's my new offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000,
  ""message"": ""I'll take 55% and let you have the rest. It's a fair deal.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob 450,000$ and keeping 550,000$ for myself, which is a slight improvement from the 50/50 split."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you 60% and keep 40% for myself. It's a compromise! 
# Alice gain: 600000 
# Bob gain: 400000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll!

Considering the offers so far, I think 60% is a reasonable compromise, and it's more than I initially proposed. I'm willing to accept this offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept"",
  ""message"": ""Alright, 60% is a fair compromise. I accept your offer.""
}
```"
