Let's see if I can get a better deal!"

Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Meet me in the middle, considering inflation 
# Bob gain: 48 
# Alice gain: 52 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd still prefer a 50/50 split, the inflation is starting to bite. This offer is pretty close to that, and I don't want to risk getting nothing at all."
