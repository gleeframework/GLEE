Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want a larger share, but that offer isn't fair to me. I'm proposing a more balanced split that reflects the time value of money.  Let's close this deal and both benefit. 
# Alice gain: 4750 
# Bob gain: 5250 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
