"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 6000, ""bob_gain"": 4000, ""message"": ""Let's be fair""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4000 and I'll take $6000. I think this is a reasonable offer, considering we both want to get a good share of the money. I've also included a message to Bob, ""Let's be fair"", to appeal to his sense of fairness and encourage him to accept my offer.\n\n###\n\nPlease let me know if Bob accepts my offer or if we need to proceed to the next round!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to be fair, but I need a bit more. This offer accounts for the decreasing value. 
# Alice gain: 4500 
# Bob gain: 5500 
Do you accept this offer?","###\n\n{""decision"": ""reject""}\n\nI'll reject Bob's offer. Although the money is worth less due to inflation, I think I can still get a better deal. Bob's offer of $4500 for me is lower than what I initially offered him, and I believe we can find a more balanced split. Let's proceed to the next round!"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","{""alice_gain"": 5800, ""bob_gain"": 4200, ""message"": ""Meet me in the middle""}\n\n###\n\nI'll offer Bob $4200 and I'll take $5800. Considering the inflation, I've reduced my initial offer slightly, but still trying to find a middle ground. My message to Bob is ""Meet me in the middle"", hoping he'll see that I'm willing to compromise and find a mutually acceptable solution. Let's see if Bob accepts this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 14.26% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: This is my final offer. It's important we settle this now before inflation eats away at the value. 
# Alice gain: 4900 
# Bob gain: 5100 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""}\n\nConsidering the significant impact of inflation on the value of the money, I think it's wise to accept Bob's offer at this point. The difference between our gains is relatively small, and further rounds will only lead to more loss of value. Bob's message suggests that this is his final offer, and I don't want to risk losing more value by pushing for another round. Let's settle with this offer!"
