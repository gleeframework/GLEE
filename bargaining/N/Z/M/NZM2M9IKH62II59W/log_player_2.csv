"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice gain: 90 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""reject""}"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 70,
""alice_gain"": 30,
""message"": ""My turn! How about this - a much better deal for you than your previous offer, and it still leaves us both with a good amount.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, I'm willing to compromise a little more.  This is my final offer, let's end this! 
# Bob gain: 60 
# Alice gain: 40 
Do you accept this offer?","{""decision"": ""accept""} 
```
Even with the impact of inflation on Alice's share, this is a reasonable offer and better than what I might get if I hold out and she proposes an even smaller amount in a future round.
