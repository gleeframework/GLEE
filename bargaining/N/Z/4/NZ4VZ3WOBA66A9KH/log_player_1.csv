"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Here's my opening offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 700000,
  ""bob_gain"": 300000
}
```

I'm offering to give myself 70% of the initial $1,000,000 and Bob 30%."

Round 2

Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 500000 
# Bob gain: 500000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is already taking a toll on my potential gain. Here's my decision:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'd like to see if I can get a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000.","Considering the inflation, my offer will be:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 550000,
  ""bob_gain"": 450000
}
```

I'm trying to adjust for the inflation by offering myself a slightly higher percentage of the remaining money."

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 48.8% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is really taking a hit on my potential gain now. Considering the offer, I'll decide:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll take the offer, as it's getting increasingly difficult to make a better deal considering the inflation."
