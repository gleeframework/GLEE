"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here is my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 90,
  ""bob_gain"": 10,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a generous offer. Accept and we can end the game quickly!""
}
```

This offer gives me $90 and Bob $10, with the message encouraging Bob to accept the offer and end the game quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Let's be fair and split the money evenly. No need to complicate things. 
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money is worth 5% less in the second round, my gain of $90 in the first round is now worth $85.70 in the second round.

Considering Bob's offer, I think it's a reasonable proposal, and I'd rather not risk going further into the game. I'll accept the offer.

  ""decision"": ""accept""
