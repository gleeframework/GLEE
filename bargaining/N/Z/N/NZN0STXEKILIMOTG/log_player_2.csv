I'm Bob, and I'm going to try and get a better deal than a 50/50 split.  Let's see how this inflation plays out!"
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 600000, ""alice_gain"": 400000, ""message"": ""I think we can do better than a 50/50 split.  Inflation is a factor, and I'd like to see a slightly larger share for my risk.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 36% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 19% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your perspective on the risk. Let's adjust the split slightly in your favor to account for inflation and your risk. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 

While I'd like to get more, the inflation is hitting hard. This is a good deal considering the circumstances and ensures the game ends."
