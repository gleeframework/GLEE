"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40
}
```

I'm offering Bob 40% of the initial 100$, which is 40 dollars. I'll take the remaining 60 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 50 
# Bob gain: 50 
Do you accept this offer?","Since the money I gain is worth 10% less due to inflation, I'll have to adjust my decision accordingly.

I accept Bob's offer:
```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```
I'll take 50 dollars, which is 50% of the current value of the money."
