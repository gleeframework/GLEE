"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. You can try to negotiate for more in the next round.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60-40 split in my favor, which is a relatively fair starting point. Now it's Bob's turn!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take a slightly larger share this time, but I'm willing to compromise. 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","The pressure is on!

Considering the reduced value of the money due to inflation, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. Since my gain is worth 10% less than in the previous round, I'll aim to get a higher share to compensate for the loss.

However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure I want to give up 70% of the remaining amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the reduced value of money due to inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share this time. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 55,
  ""bob_gain"": 45,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I need a bit more to account for the inflation. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55-45 split, which is a bit more in my favor to account for the reduced value of the money. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to what I want, but I'm still willing to negotiate. 
# Alice gain: 20 
# Bob gain: 80 
Do you accept this offer?","The inflation is taking a toll on my potential earnings!

Considering the significant reduction in the value of the money, I'll have to think carefully about this offer. However, Bob's offer is quite aggressive, and I'm not sure I want to give up 80% of the remaining amount.

I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}

"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","The game is getting intense!

Considering the rapid inflation, I'll aim to get a higher share this time. However, I also want to be realistic about the remaining amount. Here's my proposal for Round 5:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 35,
  ""bob_gain"": 65,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to give you a larger share, but I need something to show for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.""
}
```

I'm proposing a 35-65 split, which is a bit more in Bob's favor to try to find a compromise. Now it's Bob's turn again!"
