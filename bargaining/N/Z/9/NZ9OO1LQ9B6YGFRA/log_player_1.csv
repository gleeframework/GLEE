"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000.","Here's my offer for Round 1:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 7000,
  ""bob_gain"": 3000
}
```

This is a relatively fair split, but I'm trying to leave some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 5% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 6000 
# Bob gain: 4000 
Do you accept this offer?","Considering the inflation effect, my proposal in Round 1 was equivalent to 6300$ for me and 2700$ for Bob. 

Bob's offer in Round 2 is equivalent to 6000$ for me and 3840$ for Bob.

I'll accept Bob's offer.
