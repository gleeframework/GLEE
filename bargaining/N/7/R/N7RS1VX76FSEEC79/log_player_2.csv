"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's start with a fair split. I'll take a larger share, but you get something too. What do you say? 
# Bob gain: 1000 
# Alice gain: 9000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""}
``` 

It's too early to accept such a lopsided offer. There are 12 rounds, and the inflation will work in my favor. I'll see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 5500, ""alice_gain"": 4500, ""message"": ""I think this is a fair starting point. We both get a good amount, and with inflation, it will be more beneficial for both of us in the future.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation,  the money Alice gains is worth 9.75% less than in the first round. The money you gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split the money evenly. This ensures we both get a fair share, and with the inflation, we can both benefit from a larger portion of the money now. 
# Bob gain: 5000 
# Alice gain: 5000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""}
``` 
An even split is fair, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with the limited rounds left. Accepting this ensures I get a decent amount of money."
