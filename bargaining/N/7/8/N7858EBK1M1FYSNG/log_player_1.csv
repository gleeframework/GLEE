"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 600000,
  ""bob_gain"": 400000,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split, Bob!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $400,000, which is 40% of the original amount. This way, we both get a decent chunk of the money, and we can negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to compromise, but I think I deserve more 
# Alice gain: 300000 
# Bob gain: 700000 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 10% less, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: 300,000
* Bob gain: 700,000

I don't think this is a fair split, considering the original amount was 1,000,000. I'll reject this offer.

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```"
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","Considering the inflation and the previous offers, I'll try to make a more aggressive offer this time.

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 420000,
  ""bob_gain"": 580000,
  ""message"": ""You're getting close, but I'm not giving up yet!""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $580,000, which is a bit more than he proposed in round 2. Let's see if he's willing to accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 27.1% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not budging, Alice, I think this is a fair compromise 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","Let's calculate the actual amounts considering the inflation:

* Original amount: $1,000,000
* Round 1: $1,000,000
* Round 2: $900,000 (10% less)
* Round 3: $810,000 (10% less)
* Round 4: $590,700 (27.1% less than Round 3, not 10% less, I assume this is a typo)

So, the actual amounts are:

* Alice gain: $400,000
* Bob gain: $600,000

I think this offer is a good compromise, considering the inflation. I'll accept this offer.
