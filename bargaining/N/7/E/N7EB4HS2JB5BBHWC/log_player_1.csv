"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 60,
  ""bob_gain"": 40,
  ""message"": ""Let's start with a fair split. Accept this and we can end the game.""
}
```

I'm offering Bob $40, which is a relatively small amount to start, to try to create a sense of urgency and encourage him to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money bob gains is worth 10% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: You're being too generous, let's try for more! 
# Alice gain: 30 
# Bob gain: 70 
Do you accept this offer?","With the money being worth 5% less for me and 10% less for Bob, I'll have to be more aggressive in my next offer. But first, I'll reject Bob's offer:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not going to accept an offer that gives me only $30, especially when the money is worth less due to inflation. I'll wait for my next turn to make a new proposal."

Round 3
Send your offer to divide $100 and a message to Bob.","With the money being worth even less due to inflation, I'll try to be more aggressive in my offer. Here's my proposal for Round 3:

  ""bob_gain"": 50,
  ""message"": ""Let's meet in the middle. No more generosity from me!""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50-50 split, which is a more equal distribution of the remaining money. This might be a more attractive option for Bob, especially since the money is worth even less now."

```
{
  ""decision"": ""accept""
}
```

I'll accept the offer of $28, which is a very small amount, but it's better than walking away with nothing. I'll have to live with the fact that Bob gets a much larger share of the remaining money."
