"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my first offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5000,
  ""bob_gain"": 5000,
  ""message"": ""Let's split it down the middle to start""
}
```

I'm proposing a 50/50 split to begin with, and I'm hoping Bob will accept this fair offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll take the majority, but I'll give you a small consolation prize 
# Alice gain: 2000 
# Bob gain: 8000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to take the majority of the pot. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 80/20 split, especially when I'm only getting a ""small consolation prize"" of $2000. I'd like to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 2.
Round 3
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 6000,
  ""bob_gain"": 4000,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like a slightly larger share""
}
```

I'm proposing a 60/40 split in my favor, hoping to get a better deal than the 40/60 split Bob offered me in the previous round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'll give you a slightly better deal, but I'm still the one who's going to come out on top 
# Alice gain: 3000 
# Bob gain: 7000 
Do you accept this offer?","It seems like Bob is trying to squeeze me out again. Here's my response:

```
{
  ""decision"": ""reject""
}
```

I'm not willing to accept a 30/70 split, especially when I was hoping for a better deal after my previous counteroffer. I'd like to make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You have chosen to reject Bob's offer from round 4.
Round 5
Send your offer to divide $10,000 and a message to Bob.","Here's my next offer:

```
{
  ""alice_gain"": 5500,
  ""bob_gain"": 4500,
  ""message"": ""I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to be closer to 60%""
}
```

I'm proposing a 55/45 split, trying to find a compromise that's closer to my original target of 60% but still gives Bob a decent share."
