"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Let's split it 90/10, I think that's fair considering I'm taking on more risk with the inflation. 
# Bob gain: 100000 
# Alice gain: 900000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""reject""} 
``` 
 
This offer is too lopsided in Alice's favor, especially considering the inflation rate. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You have chosen to reject Alice's offer from round 1.
Round 2
Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Alice.","```json
{""bob_gain"": 550000, ""alice_gain"": 450000, ""message"": ""Let's split the money more evenly. I'm willing to give you 450,000, but I need to get at least 550,000 to make it worthwhile given the inflation.""}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 19% less than in the first round. The money alice gains is worth 36% less than in the first round.
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to go down to 60/40, but that's my final offer. I'm losing a lot more value with each round, and I need to get a good share to make this worthwhile. 
# Bob gain: 400000 
# Alice gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","```json
{""decision"": ""accept""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a more even split, the inflation is significantly impacting the value of the money for both of us. Accepting this offer is the best way to ensure we both get something worthwhile."
