Send your offer to divide $1,000,000 and a message to Bob.","{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 5% less than in the first round. The money Bob gains is worth the same as in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I think a 60/40 split is more fair.  I'm willing to take a bit less to ensure we both get a good share.  Let's get this done! 
# Alice gain: 400000 
# Bob gain: 600000 
Do you accept this offer?","{
