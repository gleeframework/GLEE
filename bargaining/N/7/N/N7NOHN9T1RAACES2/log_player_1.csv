"Round 1
Send your offer to divide $100.","Here's my proposal for Round 1:

{""alice_gain"": 60, ""bob_gain"": 40}

I'm offering Bob 40 dollars, which is a fair share considering we're starting with 100 dollars."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Due to inflation, the money you gain is worth 20% less than in the first round.
Bob's offer:
# Alice gain: 40 
# Bob gain: 60 
Do you accept this offer?","I'm not thrilled about the proposal, but I'll consider it.

Since the money is worth 20% less, I'll need to adjust my thinking. In this round, 40 dollars is only worth 32 dollars in the previous round's value.

I'll accept Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""accept""}"
